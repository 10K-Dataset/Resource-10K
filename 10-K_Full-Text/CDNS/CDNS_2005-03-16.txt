Factors Driving the Electronic Design Automation Industry

During the last decade, the worldwide communications, business
productivity and consumer electronics markets accounted for much
of the growth in the electronics industry. Ever-decreasing
silicon manufacturing process geometries, coupled with the move
to 300 millimeter wafer production, are causing IC unit cost
decreases,

volume increases and greater complexity
for providers of electronics devices. At the same time, the
development of ICs with greater functionality complicates
effective integration of components into complete electronic
systems. These market and technology forces pose major
challenges for the global electronics design community, and
consequently create significant opportunities and challenges for
EDA product and services providers.

From a design perspective, many of today’s complex ICs are
system-on-a-chip, or SoC, devices. SoC design requires the
implementation of an entire electronics sub-system on a single
IC, which is made possible



by smaller feature sizes characteristic of the newest IC
fabrication processes. Smaller feature sizes make it possible to
put additional circuitry on a single segment of silicon, or die.
SoCs typically include one or more processors (microprocessors
and digital signal processors), a high-performance bus for
on-chip data communication, numerous memory devices and
peripherals, custom digital circuitry, custom analog circuitry
and millions of lines of software code developed to run on the
resulting device. These complex devices offer benefits in terms
of price, performance, power and size; however, they are
extremely difficult to design. Successful SoC design requires
the convergence of the previously distinct domains of embedded
software, digital logic, analog circuitry, IC packaging and PCB
design. This convergence is changing the way designs for these
devices are created.

The migration to nanometer design poses major challenges for
design teams. Nanometer design refers to the design of ICs that
will have feature sizes smaller than 180 nanometers or one
hundred eighty billionths of a meter (for reference, the
diameter of the period at the end of this sentence is
approximately 400,000 nanometers). IC feature sizes for
wires, transistors and contacts decrease with each advance in
the semiconductor manufacturing process. Each move to a smaller
feature size (e.g., decreasing from 130 nanometers to
90 nanometers and smaller) requires introducing new
capabilities throughout the entire design and manufacturing
chain to account for physical effects that were inconsequential
at larger geometries but now limit device yield, performance,
reliability and the ability to function as intended. For
example, at 130 nanometers, signal integrity issues such as
crosstalk between signal wires and voltage drop on power wires
becomes critical. At 90 nanometers, device power leakage
becomes a major factor in total power consumption. The increased
complexity, electrical “noise” and power consumption
due to leakage combine to increase the challenge to design teams
in meeting chip performance specifications.

These trends pose significant new challenges for electronics
design teams. Specifically, nanometer design requires designers
to take into account many physical effects that were too small
to affect the performance of larger circuit geometries. SoC
design requires new approaches to managing complexity and its
related risks. The electronics industry addresses these
challenges in a number of ways, including the use of new EDA
products, the upgrade of existing tools and design
methodologies, and offering the advantages of highly integrated
front-to-back design solutions.

Operating Segments

During 2004, we combined our three reporting segments into one
segment. Our chief operating decision maker is our President and
Chief Executive Officer, or CEO. Our CEO reviews our
consolidated results within only one segment.

Products

Our products are engineered to improve our customers’
design productivity and resulting design quality by providing
the most comprehensive set of EDA design technology in the
industry. Product revenues include all fees earned from granting
licenses to use our software, and from sales and leases of our
hardware products, and exclude revenues derived from Maintenance
and Services. We offer customers three license types for our
software: perpetual, term and subscription. See “Software
Licensing Arrangements” below for additional discussion of
our license types.

Product revenue represented 61% of our total revenue in 2004,
59% in 2003 and 63% in 2002.

Product Strategy

With the addition of emerging nanometer design considerations to
the already burgeoning set of traditional design tasks, complex
SoC or IC design can no longer be accomplished using a
collection of discrete design tools. What previously consisted
of sequential design activities must be merged and accomplished
nearly simultaneously without time-consuming data translation
steps. We combine our design technologies into
“platforms” for four major design activities:
functional verification, digital IC design, custom IC design and
system interconnect. The four Cadence design platforms are
Incisive

tm

functional verification,
Encounter

tm

digital IC design, Virtuoso® custom design and
Allegro® system interconnect platforms. In



addition, we augment these platform product offerings with a
comprehensive set of design for manufacturing products that
service both the digital and custom IC design flows. These four
platforms, together with our design for manufacturing products,
comprise our primary product lines.

Incisive Functional Verification Platform

The Incisive functional verification platform enables our
customers to employ an efficient and unified methodology, from
design of the total system, to design of particular ICs, to
design of specific systems, for all design domains. Compared to
traditional simulation approaches, the Incisive platform
provides faster full-chip verification throughout the entire
design cycle, which significantly reduces total verification
time.

The Incisive platform overcomes fragmentation by unifying
multiple verification techniques around a single engine. It also
provides support for open design and verification standards as
well as analog/mixed-signal verification. In addition, the
Incisive platform includes a comprehensive assertion-based
verification, or ABV, environment — unifying tools,
language, intellectual property, or IP, debugging and coverage
for increased verification productivity. The Incisive ABV
solution speeds verification of complex designs by creating an
environment that helps users define assertions correctly,
enables early detection of bugs close to the source, and
monitors for completeness through assertion coverage. The same
platform delivers Palladium® hardware in-circuit emulation
and simulation acceleration-on-demand, transaction-level
support, hardware description language analysis, coverage, debug
and analysis, and test generation. Not only is Incisive designed
so customers can adopt these technologies incrementally, it can
also deliver the speed and efficiency required to compress our
customers’ overall verification time. The
QuickCycles

tm

capability allows customers to access Palladium simulation
acceleration and emulation products on a pay-as-you-go basis,
either on the customer site or remotely over a high-speed,
secure network connection.

Encounter Digital IC Design Platform

The Encounter digital IC design platform enables our customers
to implement all aspects of their digital nanometer-scale
designs. It is based on a single user interface and unified
in-memory data model, and was specifically designed to
facilitate the analysis and optimization of wiring throughout
our customers’ design process. It is comprised of the
following core technologies:

•

Encounter RTL Compiler, featuring global synthesis for smaller,
    faster, lower power designs;

•

First Encounter® Global Physical Synthesis, or GPS, is a
    silicon virtual prototyping system that assists customers in
    reaching their design’s timing goals by optimizing many
    circuit paths on the design concurrently;

•

NanoRoute

tm

is an independent routing, optimization, verification and chip
    finishing solution;

•

CeltIC

tm

NDC (Nanometer Delay Calculator) is a signal integrity analyzer;

•

Encounter Test
    Solutions

tm

is a comprehensive test solution; and

•

Encounter Conformal® provides our customers with complete
    logic equivalence checking and design constraint management
    capability to verify that their RTL specification is equivalent
    to the final IC layout.

Unlike traditional “front-end/back-end” systems, the
Encounter platform does not require customers to perform
time-consuming translations between common tasks such as
placement, power distribution, routing, and timing/crosstalk
analysis. The SoC
Encounter

tm

GPS system supports hierarchical designs, with full-chip support
for designs containing more than 50 million gates (a gate
is an electronic switch that allows or prevents the flow of
current in a circuit). Nano
Encounter

tm

supports full-chip implementation for non-hierarchical chips and
blocks of up to 10 million gates.

Virtuoso Custom Design Platform

The Virtuoso custom design platform enables design teams to
develop silicon-accurate analog, custom digital, radio
frequency, or RF, and mixed-signal designs. With the Virtuoso
platform, designers are able to deliver silicon-accurate
designs, while addressing the growing number of physical effects
in package, power grid, interconnect, devices, and substrate
employing a “top-down” language-based design.



Delivering an advanced custom design methodology, the Virtuoso
platform enables design predictability by ensuring that the
circuit design representation will perform correctly in the
final manufactured chip. The Virtuoso platform reduces design
time by providing:

•

Reference flows for analog, mixed-signal, RF, and analog-digital
    integration focused at the wireless and analog/mixed-signal
    markets;

•

Automatic analog circuit sizing and optimization (including
    yield optimization);

•

Multi-mode simulation (digital, analog and RF) using a common
    syntax and model, and common equations;

•

Fast custom layout technologies;

•

Process migration technology;

•

Electrical vs. physical effects analysis; and

•

Physical design integration and silicon analysis for complex
    custom, cell-based, and mixed custom designs using the
    OpenAccess

tm

database.

Design for Manufacturing

The physical layout of each IC requires detailed analysis and
optimization to ensure that the design can be manufactured in
volume while performing as expected. Some of the Cadence
products that deliver DFM capabilities for nanometer SoC design
include:

•

Fire & Ice® QX and
    Assura

tm

RCX extraction products take the designer’s physical
    representation of an IC and extract the electrical properties of
    that design representation to enable further analyses, such as
    simulation and timing analysis;

•

Products in the VoltageStorm® family analyze on-chip power
    distribution for digital, analog, and SoC designs. VoltageStorm
    detects unanticipated voltage drop, enabling the customer to
    correct fatal conditions, thereby preventing extensive
    troubleshooting and delay during initial manufacturing;

•

Our physical verification products, including Assura,
    Diva®, and Dracula®, perform manufacturing design rule
    checks to ensure the proposed design meets the requirements of
    the foundry’s manufacturing process rules; and

•

Mask data preparation tools such as MaskCompose and QuickView
    help customer mask shops create mask and reticle layouts for
    chips being manufactured in nanometer processes.

Allegro System Interconnect Design Platform

The Cadence Allegro system interconnect design platform enables
design teams to design high-performance interconnect across the
domains of IC, package and PCB, reducing cost and time to
market. The system interconnect — between
input-output, or I/O, buffers and across ICs, packages and
PCBs — can be optimized through the platform’s
co-design methodology, reducing both hardware costs and design
cycles. Designers use the Allegro platform’s
constraint-driven methodology and advanced capabilities for
design capture, signal integrity and physical implementation.
The Allegro co-design methodology works with our Encounter and
Virtuoso platforms, enabling effective design chain
collaboration. Silicon design-in kits speed time to market by
allowing IC companies to shorten new device adoption time and
allowing systems companies to accelerate PCB system design
cycles.

The System Interconnect product group includes the Allegro
system interconnect platform and the OrCAD® product line of
PCB design products that is engineered for individual or small
design team productivity. The OrCAD product line is marketed
exclusively through a worldwide network of value added resellers.

Verification and Application Specific Programming, or ASP,
Services

We offer verification and ASP services through Time-to-Market
Engineering, or TtME, services. Our TtME team provides customers
with consulting services, project services and/or complete
turnkey services for verification acceleration and system
emulation. QuickCycles allows customers to access Palladium
simulation



acceleration and emulation products on a pay-as-you-go basis,
either on the customer internet site or remotely over a
high-speed, secure network connection.

Third Party Programs and Initiatives

We recognize that certain of our customers may also use
internally-developed design tools or design tools provided by
other EDA companies as well as IP available from multiple
suppliers. We support the integration of third party design
products through our OpenAccess Initiative and Connections®
and OpenChoice programs. OpenAccess is a full-featured EDA
database that supports access and manipulation of its internal
EDA data via a fully documented and freely available programming
interface. This provides an open application program interface
through which applications developed by our customers, by their
other EDA vendors, or by university research groups can all
operate within a single database and with Cadence platforms.

We have contributed the OpenAccess database to the OpenAccess
Coalition, which is operated by the Silicon Integration
Initiative, an organization of EDA, electronic system and
semiconductor industry leaders focused on improving productivity
and reducing cost in creating and producing integrated silicon
systems. The Connections Program provides other EDA companies
with access to our products to ensure that our products work
well with those third party tools. Over 130 EDA providers are
members of the Connections Program. The OpenChoice program was
instituted to enable interoperability and facilitate open
collaboration with leading IP providers of library,
processor, memory core, and verification IP to build, validate,
and deliver accurate models optimized for Cadence design and
verification solutions. The program aims to ensure
IP quality and provide Cadence customers with access to
optimized IP. A key component of the OpenChoice program is to
assist and support library providers in the integration of our
design and verification products and model formats into
customer-owned tooling, or COT, library solutions.

In addition, we work with vendors of Application Specific
Integrated Circuits, or ASICs, to ensure predictable and smooth
handoff of design data from mutual customers to ASIC
implementation. These programs foster relationships throughout
the silicon design chain with leading IP partners, silicon
manufacturers, and library provider partners to support both
ASIC and COT solutions for our customers. They are integral to
providing complete design chain solutions to IC and electronic
systems designers who depend on coordinated offerings from
multiple suppliers.

Maintenance

We provide technical support to our customers to facilitate
their use of our software and hardware products. A high level of
customer service and support is critical to the adoption and
successful use of our products.

We have a global customer support organization and specialized
field application engineering teams located in each of our
operating regions, to provide assistance to customers where and
when they need it.

Standard maintenance support includes three major components:
our Sourcelink® online support portal, which provides
24 hour access to real-time technical information on our
products; contact center support (telephone, email and web
access to our support engineers); and software updates (periodic
updates with regression-tested critical fixes and updated
functionality available via CDs or secure internet download).

Maintenance is offered to customers as an integral,
non-cancelable component of our subscription license agreements,
or as a separate agreement subject to annual renewal for our
term and perpetual license customers. During the recent downturn
in the electronics industry, some customers facing constrained
budgets elected not to renew their maintenance agreements with
us.

Some of our customers have relocated, or expanded the presence
of their design teams, away from their headquarters or
historical locations to less expensive locations in emerging
growth regions. Accordingly, to provide the most responsive and
effective support for our customers, we expect to continue
expanding the presence of our own support and application
engineering teams in emerging growth regions around the world.



Maintenance revenues represented 28% of our total revenue in
2004, 29% in 2003 and 26% in 2002. Maintenance revenue in 2005
will be predominately generated from backlog.

Services

We offer a number of fee-based services, including education and
engineering services related to IC design and methodology.
These services may be sold and performed in conjunction with the
sale, lease or license of our products or sold separately.

Services revenue represented 11% of our total revenue in 2004,
12% in 2003 and 11% in 2002.

Education Services

Our educational services include Internet, classroom and custom
courses, the content of which ranges from how to use the most
recent features of our EDA products to instruction in the latest
IC design techniques.

Engineering Services

We offer engineering services and reusable design technologies
to aid customers with the design of complex ICs. We focus our
offerings primarily on SoC devices, including both ASICs and
Application Specific Standard Parts, and on analog and mixed
signal ICs. The customers for these services primarily consist
of semiconductor and systems companies developing products for
the communications, computing, and consumer market segments. We
offer engineering capabilities to assist customers from product
concept through volume manufacturing.

We also make our design IP portfolio available to customers as
part of our technology and services solutions. These reusable
design and methodology components enable us to more efficiently
deliver our services, and allow our customers to reduce the
design complexity and time to market for the development of
complex SoCs.

In our design and methodology service practices, we leverage our
cumulative experience and knowledge of design practices across
many customers and different design environments to improve our
own service teams’ and our customers’ productivity. We
work with customers using outsourcing, consultative and
collaborative models depending on their projects and needs. Our
Virtual Computer-Aided Design, or VCAD, model enables our
engineering teams at one or more of our locations to virtually
work “side-by-side” with our customers’ teams
located elsewhere during the course of their design and
engineering projects through a secure private network
infrastructure.

Through collaboration with our customers, we are able to design
advanced ICs, gaining direct and early visibility to industry
design issues that may not be addressed adequately by
today’s EDA solutions. This enables us to accelerate the
development of new software technology and products to meet the
market’s current and future design requirements.

Marketing and Sales

We generally use a direct sales force consisting of sales people
and applications engineers to market our products and provide
maintenance and services to existing and prospective customers.
Applications engineers provide technical pre-sales as well as
post-sales support for software products. Due to the complexity
of many of our EDA products and the electronic design process in
general, the sales cycle is generally long, requiring three to
six months or more. During the sales cycle, our direct sales
force generally provides technical presentations, product
demonstrations and support for on-site customer evaluation of
our software. We also use traditional marketing approaches to
promote our products and services, including advertising, direct
mail, telemarketing, trade shows, public relations and the
Internet. As EDA products mature and become widely understood by
our marketplace we selectively utilize value added resellers to
broaden our reach and reduce cost of sales. The OrCAD and some
Incisive products are primarily marketed through these channels.



Internationally, we market and support our products and services
primarily through our subsidiaries. Until June 28, 2003, we
licensed most of our software products in Japan through Innotech
Corporation, of which we were an approximately 15% stockholder
as of January 1, 2005. In June 2003, we purchased certain
assets from Innotech, including distribution rights for certain
customers in Japan. Since June 2003, we directly license our
software products to customers for which we acquired the
distribution rights from Innotech.

Research and Development

Our investment in research and development was
$351.3 million in 2004, $340.1 million in 2003 and
$326.4 million in 2002.

The primary areas of our research include SoC design, the design
of silicon devices in the nanometer range, high-performance IC
package and PCB design, architectural-level design,
high-performance logic verification technology and
hardware/software co-design. Because the electronics industry
combines rapid innovation with rapidly increasing design and
manufacturing complexity, we focus significant investment on
enhancing our current products, as well as creating new products
and technologies.

Our future performance depends largely on our ability to
maintain and enhance our current product lines to meet advancing
semiconductor manufacturing capability, develop or acquire new
products from third parties, maintain technological
competitiveness and meet increasingly complex customer
requirements. In addition to research and development, we
maintain Cadence Laboratories, an advanced research group
responsible for exploring new directions and applications of our
technologies, migrating new technologies into our existing
offerings and maintaining strong industry relationships.

Manufacturing and Distribution

Our software production consists of configuring the
customer’s order, outsourcing the recording of the product
electronically or on CD-ROM, and producing customer-unique
access keys allowing customers to use licensed products.
Software and documentation are generally made available to
customers by secured electronic delivery. User manuals and other
documentation are generally available on CD-ROM, but are
occasionally supplied in hard copy format.

Cadence performs final assembly and test of its hardware
verification, acceleration and emulation products in
San Jose, California. Subcontractors manufacture all major
subassemblies, including all individual printed circuit boards
and custom ICs, and supply them to us for qualification and
testing prior to their incorporation into the assembled product.

Proprietary Technology

Our success depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology.
We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade
secret laws, licenses and restrictive agreements to establish
and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products.
Many of our products include software or other intellectual
property licensed from third parties. We may have to seek new or
renew existing licenses for this third party software and other
intellectual property in the future. As part of performing
design services for customers, our design services business
licenses certain software and other intellectual property of
third parties, including that of our competitors.

Competition

We compete in the EDA market for products and maintenance
primarily with three other significant companies: Synopsys,
Inc., Mentor Graphics Corporation and Magma Design Automation,
Inc. We also compete with numerous smaller EDA companies, with
manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed or have
the capability to develop their own EDA products, and with
numerous electronics design and consulting companies. We
generally compete on the basis of product quality and features,
integration in a platform or compatibility with other tools,
price and payment terms and maintenance offerings.



Our maintenance business flows directly from the products
business. The competitive issues associated with our maintenance
revenue are substantially the same as those for our product
revenue in that every maintenance contract is the direct result
of a product contract, and once we have entered into a product
contract, maintenance is generally purchased by the customer to
ensure that the customer will receive access to bug fixes and
service releases, as and when they are made available, and other
continued support.

Certain competitive factors in the design services business as
described herein differ from those of the products and
maintenance businesses. While we compete with other EDA
companies in the design services business, we compete more with
independent design service businesses. These companies vary
greatly in focus, geographic location, capability, cost
structure and pricing. In addition, manufacturers of electronic
devices may be reluctant to purchase services from independent
vendors, such as Cadence, because they wish to promote their own
internal design departments. We compete with these companies by
focusing on the design of complex analog and digital ICs. It is
our strategy to use design services as a differentiator to
further promote our Products and Maintenance businesses.

Backlog

Our backlog on January 1, 2005 was approximately
$1.7 billion, as compared to $1.6 billion on
January 3, 2004. Backlog consists of revenue to be
recognized over multiple fiscal periods after January 1,
2005:

•

From the sale or lease of hardware and subscription licenses for
    software products;

•

For maintenance contracts on hardware and software products;

•

From orders for hardware and software products sold on perpetual
    and term licenses on which customers have requested delivery
    dates after January 1, 2005;

•

From term licenses with payments that are outside our customary
    terms;

•

From license arrangements for which collection of payment is not
    probable;

•

From the undelivered portion of services contracts that are
    recognized as services are performed; and

•

From design services contracts recognized under the completed
    contract method for which services have not yet been completed.

The substantial majority of our backlog is generated by our
product and maintenance business, as customer licenses generally
include both product and maintenance components. Services do not
account for a significant component of backlog. We expect that
maintenance revenue in 2005 will be predominately generated from
backlog. We have not historically experienced significant
cancellations of our contracts with customers. However, we often
reschedule the required completion dates of services contracts
which, at times, defers revenue recognition under those
contracts beyond the original expected completion date. Changes
in customer license types or payment terms also can impact the
timing of revenue recognition. See “Software Licensing
Arrangements” for a discussion of product revenue
recognized from backlog.

Revenue Seasonality

Historically, orders and revenue have been lowest in our first
quarter and highest in our fourth quarter, with a material
decline between the fourth quarter of one year and the first
quarter of the next year. We expect the first quarter will
remain our lowest quarter for orders and revenues; orders and
revenues in other quarters will vary based on the particular
timing and type of licenses entered into with large customers.

Employees

As of January 1, 2005, we employed approximately
4,900 individuals, with approximately 2,250 in sales,
services, marketing, support and manufacturing activities,
approximately 2,150 in product development and approximately 500
in management, administration and finance. None of our employees
is represented by a labor union, and we have experienced no work
stoppages. We believe that our employee relations are good.



Software Licensing Arrangements

We sell software using three license types: subscription, term
and perpetual. Customers who prefer to license technology for a
specified, limited period of time will choose either a
subscription or term license and customers who prefer to have
the right to use the technology continuously without time
restriction choose perpetual licenses. Customers who desire
rights to remix in new technology during the life of the
contract select a subscription license, which allows customers
limited access to unspecified new technology on a
when-and-if-available basis, as opposed to a term or perpetual
license which does not include remix rights to new technology.
Payment terms for subscription and term licenses generally
provide for installments over the license period and payment
terms for perpetual licenses generally are net 30 days.

Our revenue recognition depends on a number of contract-specific
terms and conditions, including the license type, payment terms,
creditworthiness of the customer and other factors as more fully
described under the heading “Critical Accounting
Estimates” under Item 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.” Revenue associated with subscription licenses
is recognized over multiple periods over the license term
whereas product revenue associated with term and perpetual
licenses may be eligible for revenue recognition upon the
effective date and delivery of the license, assuming all other
criteria for revenue recognition have been met.

Product revenue recognized from backlog comprised approximately
68% of total product revenue in 2004, 60% in 2003 and 45% in
2002. Our revenue and results of operations may fall short of
expectations due to the actual mix of license types executed in
any given period and due to other contract-specific terms and
conditions as discussed above. We are subject to greater credit
risk on subscription and term licenses, as compared to perpetual
licenses, due to the installment payment terms generally
associated with those license types. Otherwise, the particular
risks to us of one license type versus another type do not vary
considerably.

From time to time we sell receivables from our licenses with
installment payment terms on a non-recourse or limited-recourse
basis to third party financing institutions.

For further discussion of our license agreements, revenue
recognition policies and results of operations, please refer to
“Critical Accounting Estimates” under Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.”

International Operations

We have offices located in China, France, Germany, India, Japan,
Russia, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and other areas throughout
the world. These offices primarily provide sales, research and
development and operational support functions. We consider
customer sales and support requirements, the availability of a
skilled workforce, costs and efficiencies among other relative
benefits when determining what operations to locate
internationally. For additional information regarding our
international operations see Note 19 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Factors That May Affect Future Results

Our business faces many risks. Described below are what we
believe to be the material risks that we face. If any of the
events or circumstances described in the following risks
actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of
operations could suffer.

Risks Related to Our Business

We are subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated
circuit and electronics systems industries, and any

downturn may reduce
our revenue.

Purchases of our products and services are dependent upon the
commencement of new design projects by IC manufacturers and
electronics systems companies. The IC industry is cyclical and
is characterized by constant and rapid technological change,
rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving
standards, short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in
product supply and demand.



The IC and electronics systems industries have experienced
significant downturns, often connected with, or in anticipation
of, maturing product cycles of both these industries’ and
their customers’ products and a decline in general economic
conditions. These downturns have been characterized by
diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high
inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling
prices.

Over the past several years, IC manufacturers and electronics
systems companies have experienced a downturn in demand and
production, which has resulted in reduced research and
development spending by many of our customers. Many of these
companies appear to have experienced a gradual recovery in the
second half of 2003 and throughout 2004, but they have continued
to spend cautiously. Any economic downturn in the industries we
serve could harm our business, operating results and financial
condition.

Our failure to respond quickly to technological
developments could make our products uncompetitive

and obsolete.

The industries in which we compete experience rapid silicon
technology developments, changes in industry standards, changes
in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions
and improvements. Currently, the industries we serve are
experiencing several revolutionary trends:

•

Migration to nanometer design: the size of features such as
    wires, transistors and contacts on ICs continuously shrink due
    to the ongoing advances in semiconductor manufacturing
    processes. Process feature sizes refer to the width of the
    transistors and the width and spacing of interconnect on the IC.
    Feature size is normally identified by the headline transistor
    length, which is shrinking from 130 nanometers to 90
    nanometers to 65 nanometers and smaller. This is commonly
    referred to in the semiconductor industry as the migration to
    nanometer design. It represents a major challenge for
    participants in the semiconductor industry, from IC design and
    design automation to design of manufacturing equipment and the
    manufacturing process itself. Shrinkage of transistor length to
    such infinitesimal proportions is challenging the industry in
    the application of more complex physics and chemistry that is
    needed to realize advanced silicon devices. For EDA tools,
    models of each component’s electrical properties and
    behavior become more complex as do requisite analysis, design
    and verification capabilities. Novel design tools and
    methodologies must be invented quickly to remain competitive in
    the design of electronics in the nanometer range.

•

The ability to design SoCs increases the complexity of managing
    a design that, at the lowest level, is represented by billions
    of shapes on the fabrication mask. In addition, SoCs typically
    incorporate microprocessors and digital signal processors that
    are programmed with software, requiring simultaneous design of
    the IC and the related software embedded on the IC.

•

With the availability of seemingly endless gate capacity, there
    is an increase in design reuse, or the combining of
    off-the-shelf design IP with custom logic to create ICs. The
    unavailability of high-quality design IP that can be reliably
    incorporated into a customer’s design with Cadence IC
    implementation products and services could reduce demand for our
    products and services.

•

Increased technological capability of Field-Programmable Gate
    Array, which is a programmable logic chip, creates an
    alternative to IC implementation for some electronics companies.
    This could reduce demand for Cadence’s IC implementation
    products and services.

•

A growing number of low-cost design services businesses could
    reduce the need for some IC companies to invest in EDA products.

•

The challenges of nanometer design are leading some customers to
    work with older, less risky manufacturing processes. This may
    reduce their need to upgrade their EDA products and design flows.

If we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these
developments and the evolution of these changes, we may lose our
competitive position, and our products or technologies may
become uncompetitive or obsolete. To compete successfully, we
must develop or acquire new products and improve our existing
products and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with
technological developments in our industries. We must also be
able to support a range of changing computer software, hardware
platforms and customer preferences. We cannot guarantee that we
will be successful in this effort.



We have experienced varied quarterly operating results,
and our operating results for any particular fiscal

period are affected by
the timing of significant orders for our software products,
fluctuations in

customer preferences
for license types and the timing of recognition of revenue under
those license

types.

We have experienced, and may continue to experience, varied
quarterly operating results. In particular, we have recently
experienced quarterly net losses and we may experience net
losses in future periods. Various factors affect our quarterly
operating results and some of them are not within our control.
Our quarterly operating results are affected by the timing of
significant orders for our software products because a
significant number of licenses for our software products are in
excess of $5.0 million. The failure to complete a license
for one or more orders for our software products in a particular
quarter could seriously harm our operating results for that
quarter.

Our operating results are also affected by the mix of license
types executed in any given period. We license software using
three different license types: subscription, term and perpetual.
Product revenue associated with term and perpetual licenses is
generally recognized at the beginning of the license period,
whereas product revenue associated with subscription licenses is
recognized over multiple periods over the term of the license.
Revenue may also be deferred under term and perpetual licenses
until payments become due and payable from customers with
nonlinear payment terms or as cash is collected from customers
with lower credit ratings.

We continue to observe increasing customer preference for our
subscription licenses and requests for more flexible payment
terms. We expect revenue recognized from backlog to increase as
a percentage of product revenue, on an annual basis, assuming
that customers continue to prefer subscription licenses, or
continue to request more flexible payment terms, both of which
cause revenue to be recognized over time. In addition, revenue
is impacted by the timing of license renewals, the extent to
which contracts contain flexible payment terms and the mix of
license types (i.e., perpetual, term or subscription) for
existing customers, which changes could have the effect of
accelerating or delaying the recognition of revenue from the
timing of recognition under the original contract.

We plan operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted
revenue levels. These expenses and the impact of long-term
commitments are relatively fixed in the short term. A shortfall
in revenue could lead to operating results below expectations
because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed
expenses in response to short-term business changes.

You should not view our historical results of operations as
reliable indicators of our future performance. If revenue or
operating results fall short of the levels expected by public
market analysts and investors, the trading price of our common
stock could decline dramatically.

Our future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed
customer base continuing to license additional

products, renew
maintenance agreements and purchase additional services.

Our installed customer base has traditionally generated
additional new license, service and maintenance revenues. In
future periods, customers may not necessarily license additional
products or contract for additional services or maintenance.
Maintenance is generally renewable annually at a customer’s
option, and there are no mandatory payment obligations or
obligations to license additional software. If our customers
decide not to renew their maintenance agreements or license
additional products or contract for additional services, or if
they reduce the scope of the maintenance agreements, our revenue
could decrease, which could have an adverse effect on our
results of operations.

We may not receive significant revenue from our current
research and development efforts for several

years, if at
all.

Internally developing software products and integrating acquired
software products into existing platforms is expensive, and
these investments often require a long time to generate returns.
Our strategy involves significant investments in software
research and development and related product opportunities. We
believe



that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of
resources to our research and development efforts to maintain
our competitive position. However, we cannot predict that we
will receive significant, if any, revenue from these investments.

We have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and
businesses and may not realize the expected

benefits of these
acquisitions.

We have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and
businesses in the future. While we expect to carefully analyze
all potential acquisitions before committing to the transaction,
we cannot assure you that our management will be able to
integrate and manage acquired products and businesses
effectively or that the acquisitions will result in long-term
benefits to us or our stockholders. In addition, acquisitions
involve a number of risks. If any of the following events occurs
after we acquire another business, it could seriously harm our
business, operating results and financial condition:

•

Difficulties in combining previously separate businesses into a
    single unit;

•

The substantial diversion of management’s attention from
    day-to-day business when evaluating and negotiating these
    transactions and then integrating an acquired business;

•

The discovery, after completion of the acquisition, of
    liabilities assumed from the acquired business or of assets
    acquired that are not realizable;

•

The failure to realize anticipated benefits such as cost savings
    and revenue enhancements;

•

The failure to retain key employees of the acquired business;

•

Difficulties related to integrating the products of an acquired
    business in, for example, distribution, engineering and customer
    support areas;

•

Unanticipated costs;

•

Customer dissatisfaction with existing license agreements with
    Cadence which may dissuade them from licensing or buying
    products acquired by Cadence after the effective date of the
    license; and

•

Failure to understand and compete effectively in markets in
    which we have limited previous experience.

In a number of our acquisitions, we have agreed to make future
cash or stock payments based on the performance of the
businesses we acquired. The performance goals pursuant to which
these future payments may be made generally relate to
achievement by the acquired business of certain specified
bookings, revenue, product proliferation, product development or
employee retention goals during a specified period following
completion of the applicable acquisition. Future acquisitions
may involve issuances of stock as payment of the purchase price
for the acquired business and also incentive stock or option
grants to employees of the acquired businesses (which may be
dilutive to existing stockholders), expenditure of substantial
cash resources or the incurrence of material amounts of debt.

The specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of
contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition.
In fiscal 2004, we issued or reserved for future issuance
1.1 million shares to former stockholders of acquired
companies, as contingent earnout purchase price. In addition, in
fiscal 2004, we made cash payments of $17.0 million and
accrued an additional $7.2 million of cash payments to
former stockholders of acquired companies, as contingent earnout
purchase price.

In connection with our acquisitions completed prior to
January 1, 2005, we may be obligated to pay up to an
aggregate of $47.0 million in cash during the next
12 months and an additional $36.0 million in cash
during the three years following the next 12 months if
certain performance goals related to one or more of the
following criteria are achieved in full: revenue, bookings,
product proliferation, product development or employee retention.

Future acquisitions may result in increased goodwill and other
intangible assets, in addition to acquisition-related charges.
These assets may eventually be written down to the extent they
are deemed to be impaired, and any such impairments would
adversely affect our results of operations.



Our failure to attract, train, motivate and retain key
employees may make us less competitive in our industries

and therefore harm our
results of operations.

Our business depends on the efforts and abilities of our senior
management, our research and development staff, and a number of
other key management, sales, support, technical and services
employees. The high cost of training new employees, not fully
utilizing these employees, or losing trained employees to
competing employers could reduce our gross margins and harm our
business and operating results. Competition for highly skilled
employees can be intense, particularly in geographic areas
recognized as high technology centers such as the Silicon Valley
area, where our principal offices are located, and the other
locations where we maintain facilities. If economic conditions
continue to improve and job opportunities in the technology
industry become more plentiful, we may experience increased
employee attrition and increased competition for skilled
employees. To attract, retain and motivate individuals with the
requisite expertise, we may be required to grant large numbers
of stock options or other stock-based incentive awards, which
may be dilutive to existing stockholders. Our adoption of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS,
No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment, an amendment of FASB
Statements Nos. 123 and 95,” during our third quarter of
2005 will result in additional compensation expense. We may also
be required to pay key employees significant base salaries and
cash bonuses, which could harm our operating results.

In addition, regulations adopted by the NYSE and NASDAQ require
stockholder approval for new equity compensation plans and
significant amendments to existing plans, including increases in
shares available for issuance under such plans, and prohibit
NYSE and NASDAQ member organizations from giving a proxy to vote
on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the
shares has given voting instructions. These regulations could
make it more difficult for us to grant equity compensation to
employees in the future. To the extent that these regulations
make it more difficult or expensive to grant equity compensation
to employees, we may incur increased compensation costs or find
it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, which
could materially and adversely affect our business.

The competition in our industries is substantial and we
cannot assure you that we will be able to continue

to successfully
compete in our industries.

The EDA market and the commercial electronics design and
methodology services industries are highly competitive. If we
fail to compete successfully in these industries, it could
seriously harm our business, operating results and financial
condition. To compete in these industries, we must identify and
develop or acquire innovative and cost competitive
EDA products, integrate them into platforms and market them
in a timely manner. We must also gain industry acceptance for
our design and methodology services and offer better strategic
concepts, technical solutions, prices and response time, or a
combination of these factors, than those of other design
companies and the internal design departments of electronics
manufacturers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
compete successfully in these industries. Factors that could
affect our ability to succeed include:

•

The development by others of competitive EDA products or
    platforms and design and methodology services, which could
    result in a shift of customer preferences away from our products
    and services and significantly decrease revenue;

•

Decisions by electronics manufacturers to perform design and
    methodology services internally, rather than purchase these
    services from outside vendors due to budget constraints or
    excess engineering capacity;

•

The challenges of developing (or acquiring externally-developed)
    technology solutions which are adequate and competitive in
    meeting the requirements of next-generation design challenges;

•

The significant number of current and potential competitors in
    the EDA industry and the low cost of entry;

•

Intense competition to attract acquisition targets, which may
    make it more difficult for us to acquire companies or
    technologies at an acceptable price or at all; and

•

The combination of or collaboration among many
    EDA companies to deliver more comprehensive offerings than
    they could individually.



We compete in the EDA products market primarily with
Synopsys, Inc., Mentor Graphics Corporation and Magma Design
Automation, Inc. We also compete with numerous smaller
EDA companies, with manufacturers of electronic devices
that have developed or have the capability to develop their own
EDA products, and with numerous electronics design and
consulting companies. Manufacturers of electronic devices may be
reluctant to purchase services from independent vendors such as
us because they wish to promote their own internal design
departments.

We may need to change our pricing models to compete
successfully.

The intensely competitive markets in which we compete can put
pressure on us to reduce the prices of our products. If our
competitors offer deep discounts on certain products in an
effort to recapture or gain market segment share or to sell
other software or hardware products, we may then need to lower
prices or offer other favorable terms to compete successfully.
Any such changes would be likely to reduce our profit margins
and could adversely affect our operating results. Any
broadly-based changes to our prices and pricing policies could
cause sales and software license revenues to decline or be
delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust
to the new pricing policies. Some of our competitors may bundle
products for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing
strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product
implementations. These practices could, over time, significantly
constrain the prices that we can charge for our products. If we
cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in
the number of sales or with lower spending, then the reduced
license revenues resulting from lower prices could have an
adverse effect on our results of operations.

We rely on our proprietary technology as well as software
and other intellectual property rights licensed to

us by third parties, and we
cannot assure you that the precautions taken to protect our
rights will be

adequate or that we will
continue to be able to adequately secure such intellectual
property rights from

third parties.

Our success depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology.
We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade
secret laws, licenses and restrictive agreements to establish
and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products.
Despite precautions we may take to protect our intellectual
property, we cannot assure you that third parties will not try
to challenge, invalidate or circumvent these safeguards. We also
cannot assure you that the rights granted under our patents or
attendant to our other intellectual property will provide us
with any competitive advantages, or that patents will be issued
on any of our pending applications, or that future patents will
be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Furthermore,
the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary
rights in those countries to the same extent as applicable law
protects these rights in the United States. Many of our products
include software or other intellectual property licensed from
third parties. We may have to seek new or renew existing
licenses for such software and other intellectual property in
the future. Our design services business holds licenses to
certain software and other intellectual property owned by third
parties. Our failure to obtain, for our use, software or other
intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property
rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation
over these licenses or rights, could seriously harm our
business, operating results and financial condition.

We could lose key technology or suffer serious harm to our
business because of the infringement of our

intellectual property
rights by third parties or because of our infringement of the
intellectual property

rights of third
parties.

There are numerous patents in the EDA industry and new
patents are being issued at a rapid rate. It is not always
practicable to determine in advance whether a product or any of
its components infringes the patent rights of others. As a
result, from time to time, we may be forced to respond to or
prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect
our rights or defend a customer’s rights. These claims,
regardless of merit, could consume valuable management time,
result in costly litigation, or cause product shipment delays,
all of which could seriously harm our business, operating
results and financial condition. In settling these claims, we
may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements
with the third parties claiming



infringement. These royalty or licensing agreements, if
available, may not have terms favorable to us. Being forced to
enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could
seriously harm our business, operating results and financial
condition. Any potential intellectual property litigation could
force us to do one or more of the following:

•

Pay damages, license fees or royalties to the party claiming
    infringement;

•

Stop licensing products or providing services that use the
    challenged intellectual property;

•

Obtain a license from the owner of the infringed intellectual
    property to sell or use the relevant technology, which license
    may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all; or

•

Redesign the challenged technology, which could be
    time-consuming and costly.

If we were forced to take any of these actions, our business and
results of operations may suffer.

If our security measures are breached and an unauthorized
party obtains access to customer data, our

information systems
may be perceived as being insecure and customers may curtail
their use of, or stop

their use of, our products
and services.

Our products and services involve the storage and transmission
of customers’ proprietary information, and breaches of our
security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of
this information, litigation and potential liability. Because
techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage
information systems change frequently and generally are not
recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to
anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive
measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security
occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our
security measures could be harmed and we could lose existing
customers and our ability to obtain new customers.

We may not be able to effectively implement our
restructuring activities, and our restructuring
activities

may not result in the
expected benefits, which would negatively impact our future
results of operations.

The EDA market and the commercial electronics design and
methodology services industries are highly competitive and
change quickly. We have responded to increased competition and
changes in the industries in which we compete by restructuring
our operations and reducing the size of our workforce. Despite
our restructuring efforts over the last few years, we cannot
assure you that we will achieve all of the operating expense
reductions and improvements in operating margins and cash flows
currently anticipated from these restructuring activities in the
periods contemplated, or at all. Our inability to realize these
benefits, and our failure to appropriately structure our
business to meet market conditions, could negatively impact our
results of operations.

As part of our recent restructuring activities, we have reduced
the workforce in certain revenue-generating portions of our
business, particularly in our services business. This reduction
in staffing levels could require us to forego certain future
strategic opportunities due to limited resources, which could
negatively affect our long-term revenues.

In addition, these workforce reductions could result in a lack
of focus and reduced productivity by remaining employees due to
changes in responsibilities or concern about future prospects,
which in turn may negatively affect our future revenues.
Further, we believe our future success depends, in large part,
on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel.
Our restructuring activities could negatively affect our ability
to attract such personnel as a result of perceived risk of
future workforce reductions.

In early 2005, we announced a new plan of restructuring. We also
cannot assure you that we will not be required to implement
further restructuring activities or reductions in our workforce
based on changes in the markets and industries in which we
compete or that any future restructuring efforts will be
successful.

The lengthy sales cycle of our products and services makes
the timing of our revenue difficult to predict and

may cause our
operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly.

We have a lengthy sales cycle that generally extends at least
three to six months. The length of the sales cycle may cause our
revenue and operating results to vary from quarter to quarter.
The complexity and



expense associated with our business generally requires a
lengthy customer education, evaluation and approval process.
Consequently, we may incur substantial expenses and devote
significant management effort and expense to develop potential
relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and
may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities.

In addition, sales of our products and services may be delayed
if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because
of:

•          The
timing of customers’ competitive evaluation
processes; or

•          Customers’
budgetary constraints and budget cycles.

Lengthy sales cycles for acceleration and emulation hardware
products subject us to a number of significant risks over which
we have limited control, including insufficient, excess or
obsolete inventory, variations in inventory valuation and
fluctuations in quarterly operating results.

Also, because of the timing of large orders and our
customers’ buying patterns, we may not learn of bookings
shortfalls, revenue shortfalls, earnings shortfalls or other
failures to meet market expectations until late in a fiscal
quarter, which could cause even more immediate and serious harm
to the trading price of our common stock.

The profitability of our services business depends on
factors that are difficult to control, such as the high

cost of our services
employees, our cost of performing our fixed-price services
contracts and the success

of our design services
business, which has historically suffered losses.

To be successful in our services business, we must overcome
several factors that are difficult to control, including the
following:

•

Our cost of services employees is high and reduces our gross
    margin.

Gross margin represents the difference between the
    amount of revenue from the sale of services and our cost of
    providing those services. We must pay high salaries to attract
    and retain professional services employees. This results in a
    lower gross margin than the gross margin in our software
    business. In addition, the high cost of training new services
    employees or not fully utilizing these employees can
    significantly lower gross margin. It is difficult to adjust
    staffing levels quickly to reflect customer demand for services;
    therefore, the services business has in the past and could
    continue to experience losses.

•

A portion of services contracts consists of fixed-price
    contracts.

Some of our customers pay a fixed price for
    services provided, regardless of the cost we must incur to
    perform the contract. If our cost in performing the services
    were to exceed the amount the customer has agreed to pay, we
    would experience a loss on the contract, which could harm our
    business, operating results and financial condition.

•

We have historically suffered losses in our design services
    business.

The market for electronics design services is
    sensitive to customer budgetary constraints and engineering
    capacity. Our design services business has historically suffered
    losses. If our design services business fails to increase its
    revenue to offset its expenses, the design services business
    will continue to experience losses. Our failure to succeed in
    the design services business may harm our business, operating
    results and financial condition.

Our international operations may seriously harm our
financial condition because of the effect of foreign

exchange rate
fluctuations and other risks to our international
business.

We have significant operations outside the United States. Our
revenue from international operations as a percentage of total
revenue was approximately 50% in 2004, 44% in 2003 and 45% in
2002. We expect that revenue from our international operations
will continue to account for a significant portion of our total
revenue. We also transact business in various foreign
currencies. Recent economic and political uncertainty and the
volatility of foreign currencies in certain regions, most
notably the Japanese yen, European Union euro and the British
pound, have had, and may in the future have, a harmful effect on
our revenue and operating results.

Fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the
U.S. dollar and the currencies of other countries in which
we conduct business could seriously harm our business, operating
results and financial condition. For



example, if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign
currency exchanges into U.S. dollars, it will take more of
the foreign currency to equal the same amount of
U.S. dollars than before the rate increase. If we price our
products and services in the foreign currency, we will receive
fewer U.S. dollars than we did before the rate increase
went into effect. If we price our products and services in
U.S. dollars, an increase in the exchange rate will result
in an increase in the price for our products and services
compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in
local currency. This could result in our prices being
uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the
local currency.

Exposure to foreign currency transaction risk can arise when
transactions are conducted in a currency different from the
functional currency of one of our subsidiaries. A
subsidiary’s functional currency is generally the currency
in which it primarily conducts its operations, including product
pricing, expenses and borrowings. Although we attempt to reduce
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, significant
exchange rate movements may hurt our results of operations as
expressed in U.S. dollars.

Our international operations may also be subject to other risks,
including:

•

The adoption or expansion of government trade restrictions;

•

Limitations on repatriation of earnings;

•

Limitations on the conversion of foreign currencies;

•

Reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some
    countries;

•

Recessions in foreign economies;

•

Longer collection periods for receivables and greater difficulty
    in collecting accounts receivable;

•

Difficulties in managing foreign operations;

•

Political and economic instability;

•

Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;

•

Tariffs and other trade barriers; and

•

U.S. government licensing requirements for exports, which
    may lengthen the sales cycle or restrict or prohibit the sale or
    licensing of certain products.

We have offices throughout the world, including key research
facilities outside of the United States. Our operations are
dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the
world. Activities that interfere with our international
connectivity, such as computer “hacking” or the
introduction of a virus into our computer systems, could
significantly interfere with our business operations.

Our operating results could be adversely affected as a
result of changes in our effective tax rates.

Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by
the following:

•

Earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we are
    taxed at lower rates as compared to the U.S. statutory tax
    rate;

•

An increase in expenses not deductible for tax purposes,
    including certain stock compensation, write-offs of acquired
    in-process research and development and impairment of goodwill;

•

Changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and
    liabilities;

•

Changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws;

•

New accounting standards or interpretations of such
    standards; or

•

A change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest undistributed
    foreign earnings.

Any significant change in our future effective tax rates could
adversely impact our results of operations for future periods.

We have received an examination report from the Internal
Revenue Service proposing a tax deficiency in

certain of our tax
returns, and the outcome of the examination or any future
examinations involving

similar claims may have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash
flows.

The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine our income
tax returns. In November 2003, the IRS completed its field
examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years
1997 through 1999 and issued a Revenue Agent’s Report, or
RAR, in which the IRS proposes to assess an aggregate tax
deficiency for



the three-year period of approximately $143.0 million, plus
interest, which interest will accrue until the matter is
resolved. This interest is compounded daily at rates published
by the IRS, which rates have been between four and nine percent
since 1997, and adjust quarterly. The IRS may also make similar
claims for years subsequent to 1999 in future examinations. The
RAR is not a final Statutory Notice of Deficiency, and we have
filed a protest to certain of the proposed adjustments with the
Appeals Office of the IRS where the matter is currently being
considered.

The most significant of the disputed adjustments relates to
transfer pricing arrangements that we have with a foreign
subsidiary. We believe that the proposed IRS adjustments are
inconsistent with the applicable tax laws, and that we have
meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustments. We are
challenging these proposed adjustments vigorously.

The IRS is currently examining our federal income tax returns
for tax years 2000 through 2002.

Significant judgment is required in determining our provision
for income taxes. In determining the adequacy of our provision
for income taxes, we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse
outcomes resulting from these examinations, including the
current IRS examination and the IRS RAR for the tax years 1997
through 1999. However, the ultimate outcome of tax examinations
cannot be predicted with certainty, including the total amount
payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of
these issues. In addition, we cannot assure you that such amount
will not be materially different than that which is reflected in
our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Should the
IRS or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result
of a current or a future examination, we may be required to
record charges to operations in future periods that could have a
material impact on the results of operations, financial position
or cash flows in the applicable period or periods recorded.

Forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is
complex and subject to uncertainty, and material

differences between
forecasted and actual tax rates could have a material impact on
our results of

operations.

Forecasts of our income tax position and resultant effective tax
rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income
tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of
profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax
jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as
benefits from available deferred tax assets and costs resulting
from tax audits. To forecast our global tax rate, pre-tax
profits and losses by jurisdiction are estimated and tax expense
by jurisdiction is calculated. If the mix of profits and losses,
our ability to use tax credits, or effective tax rates by
jurisdiction is different than those estimates, our actual tax
rate could be materially different than forecasted, which could
have a material impact on our results of operations.

Failure to obtain export licenses could harm our business
by rendering us unable to ship products and transfer

our technology outside
of the United States.

We must comply with U.S. Department of Commerce regulations
in shipping our software products and transferring our
technology outside the United States and to foreign nationals.
Although we have not had any significant difficulty complying
with these regulations so far, any significant future difficulty
in complying could harm our business, operating results and
financial condition.

Errors or defects in our products and services could
expose us to liability and harm our reputation.

Our customers use our products and services in designing and
developing products that involve a high degree of technological
complexity, each of which has its own specifications. Because of
the complexity of the systems and products with which we work,
some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only
when put to full use in the marketplace. As a result, our
customers or their end users may discover errors or



defects in our software or the systems we design, or the
products or systems incorporating our design and intellectual
property may not operate as expected. Errors or defects could
result in:

•

Loss of current customers and loss of or delay in revenue and
    loss of market segment share;

•

Failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance;

•

Diversion of development resources to resolve the problem;

•

Increased service costs; and

•

Liability for damages.

New accounting standards related to equity compensation
will cause us to recognize an additional expense, but

the resulting
reduction in our net income is unknown.

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or
FASB, issued SFAS No. 123R, which requires the
measurement of all employee share-based payments to employees,
including grants of employee stock options, using a
fair-value-based method and the recording of such expense in our
Consolidated Statements of Operations. The accounting provisions
of SFAS No. 123R are effective for reporting periods
beginning after June 15, 2005. We are required to adopt
SFAS No. 123R in our third quarter of fiscal 2005. See
“Stock-Based Compensation” of Note 2 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net income
(loss) and net income (loss) per share amounts, for 2004, 2003
and 2002, as if we had used a fair-value-based method similar to
the methods required under SFAS No. 123R to measure
compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards.
Although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of
SFAS No. 123R will result in future amounts that are
similar to the current pro forma disclosures under
SFAS No. 123, we are evaluating the requirements under
SFAS No. 123R and expect the adoption to have a
significant adverse effect on our Consolidated Statements of
Operations and net income per share.

If we become subject to unfair hiring claims, we could be
prevented from hiring needed employees, incur

liability for damages
and incur substantial costs in defending ourselves.

Companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with
competitors frequently claim that these competitors have engaged
in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these
persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets.
These claims could prevent us from hiring employees or cause us
to incur liability for damages. We could also incur substantial
costs in defending ourselves or our employees against these
claims, regardless of their merits. Defending ourselves from
these claims could also divert the attention of our management
from our operations.

Our business is subject to the risk of earthquakes, floods
and other natural catastrophic events.

Our corporate headquarters, including certain of our research
and development operations, and certain of our distribution
facilities, are located in the Silicon Valley area of Northern
California, which is a region known to experience seismic
activity. In addition, several of our facilities, including our
corporate headquarters, certain of our research and development
operations, and certain of our distribution operations, are in
areas of San Jose, California that have been identified by
the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or
FEMA, as being located in a special flood area. The areas at
risk are identified as being in a one hundred year flood plain,
using FEMA’s Flood Hazard Boundary Map or the Flood
Insurance Rate Map. If significant seismic or flooding activity
were to occur, our operations may be interrupted, which would
adversely impact our business and results of operations.

We maintain research and other facilities in parts of the
world that are not as politically stable as the United

States, and as a
result we may face a higher risk of business interruption from
acts of war or

terrorism than other
businesses located only or primarily in the United
States.

We maintain international research and other facilities, some of
which are in parts of the world that are not as politically
stable as the United States. Consequently, we may face a greater
risk of business interruption as a result of terrorist acts or
military conflicts than businesses located domestically.
Furthermore, this potential harm is exacerbated given that
damage to or disruptions at our international research and



development facilities could have an adverse effect on our
ability to develop new or improve existing products as compared
to other businesses which may only have sales offices or other
less critical operations abroad. We are not insured for losses
or interruptions caused by acts of war or terrorism.

If we are unable to favorably assess the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting, or if our

independent auditors
are unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on our
assessment in the

future, our stock price
could be adversely affected.

Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Act, we are
required to assess the effectiveness of our internal controls
over financial reporting and assert that such internal controls
are effective. Our independent auditors must evaluate
management’s assessment concerning the effectiveness of our
internal controls over financial reporting and render an opinion
on our assessment and the effectiveness of our internal controls
over financial reporting. The Act has resulted in and is likely
to continue to result in increased expenses, and has required
and is likely to continue to require significant efforts by
management and other employees. Although we believe that our
efforts will enable us to remain compliant under the Act, we can
give no assurance that in the future such efforts will be
successful. Our business is complex and involves significant
judgments and estimates as described in our “Critical
Accounting Estimates.” If certain judgments and estimates
are determined incorrectly, we may be unable to assert that our
internal control over financial reporting is effective, or our
independent auditors may not be able to render the required
attestation concerning our assessment and the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting, which could
adversely effect investor confidence in us and the market price
of our common stock.

Risks Related to Our Securities

Our debt obligations expose us to risks that could
adversely affect our business, operating results and
financial

condition, and could
prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such
indebtedness.

We have a substantial level of debt. As of January 1, 2005,
we had $420.0 million of outstanding indebtedness from the
convertible notes, or the Notes, that we issued in August 2003.
The level of our indebtedness, among other things, could:

•

make it difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations on
    our debt as described below;

•

make it difficult for us to incur additional debt or obtain any
    necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital
    expenditures, debt service, acquisitions or general corporate
    purposes;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in
    our business;

•

reduce funds available for use in our operations;

•

make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our
    business;

•

make us more vulnerable in the event of an increase in interest
    rates if we must incur new debt to satisfy our obligations under
    the Notes; or

•

place us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to less
    leveraged competitors and competitors that have greater access
    to capital resources.

If we experience a decline in revenue due to any of the factors
described in this section entitled “Factors That May Affect
Future Results” or otherwise, we could have difficulty
paying amounts due on our indebtedness. In the case of the
Notes, although the Notes mature in 2023, the holders of the
Notes may require us to repurchase their notes at an additional
premium in 2008, which makes it probable that we will be
required to repurchase the Notes in 2008 if the Notes are not
otherwise converted into our common stock. If we are unable to
generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds
necessary to make required payments, or if we fail to comply
with the various requirements of our indebtedness, including the
Notes, we would be in default, which would permit the holders of
our indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness
and could cause defaults under our other indebtedness. Any
default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse
effect on our business, operating results and financial
condition.

We are not restricted under our outstanding indebtedness from
incurring additional debt, including other senior indebtedness
or secured indebtedness. In addition, our outstanding
indebtedness does not restrict our ability to pay dividends,
issue or repurchase stock or other securities or require us to
achieve or maintain any



minimum financial results relating to our financial position or
results of operations. Our ability to recapitalize, incur
additional debt and take a number of other actions that are not
limited by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness could have
the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on such
indebtedness when due. Although the Notes do not contain such
financial and other restrictive covenants, future indebtedness
could include such covenants. If we incur additional
indebtedness or other liabilities, our ability to pay our
obligations on our outstanding indebtedness could be adversely
affected.

We may be unable to adequately service our indebtedness,
which may result in defaults and other costs to us.

We may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for
additional financing to pay the outstanding obligations due on
our indebtedness. Any future borrowing arrangements or debt
agreements to which we become a party may contain restrictions
on or prohibitions against our repayment on our outstanding
indebtedness. With respect to the Notes, at maturity, the entire
outstanding principal amount of the Notes will become due and
payable. Holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or
any portion of the Notes on August 15, 2008 for 100.25% of
the principal amount, August 15, 2013 for 100.00% of the
principal amount and August 15, 2018 for 100.00% of the
principal amount. As a result, although the Notes mature in
2023, the holders may require us to repurchase the Notes at an
additional premium in 2008, which makes it probable that we will
be required to repurchase the Notes in 2008 if the Notes are not
otherwise converted into our common stock. If we are prohibited
from paying our outstanding indebtedness, we could try to obtain
the consent of lenders under those arrangements, or we could
attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain the
restrictions. If we do not obtain the necessary consents or
refinance the borrowings, we may be unable to satisfy our
outstanding indebtedness. Any such failure would constitute an
event of default under our indebtedness, which could, in turn,
constitute a default under the terms of any other indebtedness
then outstanding.

In addition, a material default on our indebtedness could
suspend our eligibility to register securities using certain
registration statement forms under SEC guidelines which permit
incorporation by reference of substantial information regarding
us, which could potentially hinder our ability to raise capital
through the issuance of our securities and will increase the
costs of such registration to us.

The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly,
which may make it difficult for stockholders to sell

our common stock when
desired or at attractive prices.

The market price of our common stock is subject to significant
fluctuations in response to the factors set forth in this
section entitled “Factors That May Affect Future
Results” and other factors, many of which are beyond our
control. Such fluctuations, as well as economic conditions
generally, may adversely affect the market price of our common
stock.

In addition, the stock markets in recent years have experienced
extreme price and trading volume fluctuations that often have
been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance
of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may
adversely affect the price of our common stock, regardless of
our operating performance.

Conversion of the Notes will dilute the ownership
interests of existing stockholders.

The terms of the Notes permit the holders to convert the Notes
into shares of our common stock. The Notes are convertible into
our common stock initially at a conversion price of
$15.65 per share, which would result in an aggregate of
approximately 26.8 million shares of our common stock
issued upon conversion, subject to adjustment upon the
occurrence of specified events. The conversion of some or all of
the Notes will dilute the ownership interest of our existing
stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock
issuable upon conversion could adversely affect prevailing
market prices of our common stock. Prior to the conversion of
the Notes, if the trading price of our common stock exceeds the
conversion price of the Notes by 145.00% or more over specified
periods, basic earnings per share will be diluted if and to the
extent the convertible notes hedge instruments are not
exercised. We may redeem for cash all or any part of the Notes
on or after August 15, 2008 for 100.00% of the principal
amount. The holders may require us to repurchase for



cash all or any portion of their notes on August 15, 2008
for 100.25% of the principal amount, on August 15, 2013 for
100.00% of the principal amount, or on August 15, 2018 for
100.00% of the principal amount.

Each $1,000 of principal of the Notes is initially convertible
into 63.879 shares of our common stock, subject to
adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of
the Notes may convert their Notes prior to maturity only if:
(1) the price of our common stock reaches $22.69 during
certain periods of time specified in the Notes,
(2) specified corporate transactions occur, (3) the
Notes have been called for redemption or (4) the trading
price of the Notes falls below a certain threshold. As a result,
although the Notes mature in 2023, the holders may require us to
repurchase their notes at an additional premium in 2008, which
makes it probable that we will be required to repurchase the
Notes in 2008 if the Notes are not otherwise converted into our
common stock. As of January 1, 2005, none of the conditions
allowing holders of the Notes to convert had been met.

Although the conversion price is currently $15.65 per
share, the convertible notes hedge and warrant transactions that
we entered into in connection with the issuance of the Notes
effectively increased the conversion price of the Notes until
2008 to approximately $23.08 per share, which would result
in an aggregate issuance upon conversion prior to
August 15, 2008 of approximately 18.2 million shares
of our common stock. We have entered into convertible notes
hedge and warrant transactions to reduce the potential dilution
from the conversion of the Notes, however we cannot guarantee
that such convertible notes hedge and warrant instruments will
fully mitigate the dilution. In addition, the existence of the
Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because
the conversion of the Notes could depress the price of our
common stock.

We may, at the option of the noteholders and only in
certain circumstances, be required to repurchase the

Notes in shares of our
common stock upon a significant change in our corporate
ownership or

structure, and issuance of
shares to repurchase the notes would result in dilution to our
existing

stockholders.

Under the terms of the Notes, we may be required to repurchase
the Notes following a significant change in our corporate
ownership or structure, such as a change of control, prior to
maturity of the Notes. Following a significant change in our
corporate ownership or structure, in certain circumstances, we
may choose to pay the repurchase price of the Notes in cash,
shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares
of our common stock. In the event we choose to pay all or any
part of the repurchase price of notes in shares of our common
stock, this would result in dilution to the holders of our
common stock.

Convertible notes hedge and warrant transactions entered
into in connection with the issuance of the

Notes may affect the
value of our common stock.

We entered into convertible notes hedge transactions with JP
Morgan Chase Bank, an affiliate of one of the initial purchasers
of the Notes, at the time of issuance of the Notes, with the
objective of reducing the potential dilutive effect of issuing
our common stock upon conversion of the Notes. We also entered
into warrant transactions. In connection with our convertible
notes hedge and warrant transactions, JP Morgan Chase Bank or
its affiliates purchased our common stock in secondary market
transactions and entered into various over-the-counter
derivative transactions with respect to our common stock. This
entity or its affiliates is likely to modify its hedge positions
from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the Notes
by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock, other of
our securities or other instruments it may wish to use in
connection with such hedging. The effect, if any, of any of
these transactions and activities on the market price of our
common stock or the Notes could adversely affect the value of
our common stock and, as a result, the number of shares and the
value of the common stock holders will receive upon conversion
of the Notes. In addition, subject to movement in the trading
price of our common stock, if the convertible notes hedge
transactions settle in our favor, we could be exposed to credit
risk related to the other party.



Rating agencies may provide unsolicited ratings on the
Notes that could reduce the market value or

liquidity of our
common stock.

We have not requested a rating of the Notes from any rating
agency and we do not anticipate that the Notes will be rated.
However, if one or more rating agencies independently elects to
rate the Notes and assigns the Notes a rating lower than the
rating expected by investors, or reduces their rating in the
future, the market price or liquidity of the Notes and our
common stock could be harmed. A resulting decline in the market
price of the Notes as compared to the price of our common stock
may require us to repurchase the Notes.

Anti-takeover defenses in our governing documents and
certain provisions under Delaware law could

prevent an acquisition
of our company or limit the price that investors might be
willing to pay for our

common stock.

Our governing documents and certain provisions of the Delaware
General Corporation Law that apply to us could make it difficult
for another company to acquire control of our company. For
example:

•

Our certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors
    to issue, at any time and without stockholder approval,
    preferred stock with such terms as it may determine. No shares
    of preferred stock are currently outstanding. However, the
    rights of holders of any of our preferred stock that may be
    issued in the future may be superior to the rights of holders of
    our common stock.

•

We have a rights plan, commonly known as a “poison
    pill,” which would make it difficult for someone to acquire
    our company without the approval of our board of directors.

•

Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
    generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any
    business combination with a person owning 15% or more of its
    voting stock, or who is affiliated with the corporation and
    owned 15% or more of its voting stock at any time within three
    years prior to the proposed business combination, for a period
    of three years from the date the person became a 15% owner,
    unless specified conditions are met.

All or any one of these factors could limit the price that
certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of our
common stock and could delay, prevent or allow our board of
directors to resist an acquisition of our company, even if the
proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our
independent stockholders.

Item 2.

Properties

Our headquarters are located in San Jose, California, and
we own the related land and buildings. Additionally, we own
buildings in India and land and buildings in Scotland. The total
square footage of our owned buildings is approximately 979,000.

We lease additional facilities for our sales offices in the
United States and various foreign countries, and our research
and development and design services facilities worldwide. We
sublease certain of these facilities where space is not fully
utilized or has been involved in restructuring activities.

We believe that these facilities and the undeveloped land we own
adjacent to our current headquarters are adequate for our
current needs and that suitable additional or substitute space
will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of our
operations.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

From time to time, we are involved in various disputes and
litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of
business. These include disputes and lawsuits related to
intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, licensing,
contract law, distribution arrangements and employee relations
matters. Periodically, we review the status of each significant
matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the
potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered
probable and a range of possible losses can be estimated, we
accrue a liability for the estimated loss at the low end of the
range. Legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties, and the
outcomes are difficult to predict. Because of such
uncertainties, accruals are based only on the best information
available at the time. As additional information becomes
available, we reassess the potential liability related to
pending claims and litigation and may revise estimates.



While the outcome of these disputes and litigation matters
cannot be predicted with any certainty, management does not
believe that the outcome of any current matters will have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position
or results of operations.

Item 5.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related
    Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity
    Securities

Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange and
the NASDAQ National Market under the symbol CDN. We have never
declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock in the
past, and we do not plan to pay cash dividends in the
foreseeable future. As of February 25, 2005, we had
approximately 1,382 registered stockholders and approximately
40,185 beneficial owners of our common stock.

The following table sets forth the high and low sales price for
Cadence common stock for each calendar quarter in the two-year
period ended January 1, 2005:

In August 2001, our Board of Directors authorized a program to
repurchase shares of our common stock with a value of up to
$500.0 million in the aggregate. There were no repurchases
of our common stock in the fourth quarter of 2004. As of
January 1, 2005, the remaining repurchase authorization
under the August 2001 program totaled $123.0 million.



Item 6.

Selected Financial Data

The following selected consolidated financial data should be
read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements
and the Notes thereto and the information contained in
Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operation.” Historical
results are not necessarily indicative of future results.

*

Beginning in our fiscal year 2002, SFAS No. 142,
    “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” was adopted
    and, as a result, we have ceased to amortize goodwill, including
    workforce intangibles that were subsumed into goodwill upon
    adoption of SFAS No. 142. The 2001 and 2000
    consolidated financial data include amortization of goodwill and
    workforce intangibles totaling $50.8 million for 2001 and
    $36.5 million for 2000.

+

On September 30, 2004, the FASB reached a consensus on
    Emerging Issues Task Force Issue, or EITF, No. 04-08,
    “Accounting Issues Related to Certain Features of
    Contingently Convertible Debt and the Effect on Diluted Earnings
    per Share.” For all periods in which the Notes are
    outstanding, EITF No. 04-08 requires us to include in
    diluted earnings per share the approximately 26.8 million
    shares of our common stock into which the Notes may be
    converted, using the “if-converted” method. There was
    no impact on our 2003 diluted EPS as a result of the adoption of
    EITF No. 04-08.



Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with
the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included
elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain of
such statements, including, without limitation, statements
regarding the extent and timing of future revenues and expenses

Overview

General

We license EDA software, sell or lease EDA hardware technology
and intellectual property and provide design and methodology
services throughout the world to help manage and accelerate
electronic product development processes. Our broad range of
products and services are used by electronics companies to
design and develop complex ICs, IC packages and PCBs and
personal and commercial electronic systems. For a detailed
discussion of the challenges and opportunities of the EDA
industry and our products and services, see Item 1,
“Business” above.

As part of our strategy, we have acquired companies, businesses
and third party intellectual property to obtain technology, key
personnel and customer relationships, and we expect to continue
making acquisitions in the future.

From 2000 through 2002, IC manufacturers and electronics
companies experienced a severe downturn in demand and
production. According to the Semiconductor Industry Association,
or SIA, semiconductor manufacturers experienced a reduction in
revenues of over 35% from late 2000 to 2002. This economic
downturn resulted in reduced research and development spending
by many of our customers.

During 2003 and 2004, IC manufacturers and electronics companies
experienced a recovery in revenues. According to the SIA,
semiconductor industry revenues grew by approximately 18% in
2003 and 28% in 2004. However, despite this recovery, our
customers continued to spend cautiously through 2004. We expect
this cautious spending to continue at least through 2005, as IC
manufacturers and electronics companies revenues are expected to
remain flat in 2005 compared to 2004.

In response to the general downturn in the economy, and in the
electronics industry in particular, we have initiated
significant restructuring activities over the past several
years, including during 2004, to better align our cost structure
with projected demand for our products and services and their
resulting projected revenues. We have announced additional
restructuring activities during 2005 and expect to announce
further restructurings in the future.

We have identified certain items that management uses as
performance indicators to manage our business, including
revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow
from operations, and we describe these items more fully in the
“Results of Operations” below.



We continue to observe a customer preference for renewable
license types, which are term and subscription, and expect the
timing of license renewals to continue to impact our results of
operations.

Product revenue recognized from backlog comprised approximately
68% of total product revenue in 2004, 60% in 2003, and 45% in
2002. This trend is primarily due to increasing customer
preference for subscription licenses and customer requirements
for more flexible payment terms.

Acquisitions

We have acquired companies, businesses and third party
technology, some of which are described below, and we expect to
acquire other companies, businesses and third party technology
in the future. We undertake these acquisitions as part of our
overall business strategy, and specifically, to acquire key
personnel, technology and customer relationships of the acquired
business. For each of these acquisitions the results of
operations and the estimated fair value of the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed have been included in our Consolidated
Financial Statements from the date of the acquisition. These
acquisitions are described in more detail below and in
Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Comparative pro forma financial information was not presented
for the 2004 or 2003 acquisitions because these acquisitions
were not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements,
either individually or in the aggregate. For additional
information regarding our 2004 acquisitions, see “Liquidity
and Capital Resources” and “Results of
Operations” found below in this Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations,” and the Notes to our
Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K.

A summary of certain information regarding acquisitions, all of
which were for cash, we completed in 2004 and 2003, including
the aggregate initial purchase price paid, is as follows:

The businesses or assets acquired include:

(A)

Rapid analog design technology.

(B)

Functional verification technology.

(C)

Distribution rights to certain customers, certain assets and key
    personnel of this Japan-based developer and distributor of
    software, electronic devices and semiconductor manufacturing
    equipment.

(D)

Nanometer-scale synthesis.

(E)

Silicon modeling products and full-chip circuit simulation.

The purchase prices of our acquisitions generally consist of one
or more of the following: cash payments, shares of our common
stock, the fair value of assumed options, if any, and
acquisition costs. In general, the purchase price and goodwill
associated with business acquisitions will increase above the
initial purchase price paid if certain performance goals related
to one or more of the following: revenue, bookings, product
proliferation, product development and employee retention, which
are measured over periods of up to four years following the
acquisitions, are achieved.



Concurrent with our acquisition of certain Innotech assets, we
also modified our distributor agreement with Innotech. Prior to
this acquisition, we licensed most of our software products in
Japan through Innotech, of which we were an approximately 15%
stockholder as of January 1, 2005. We now directly license
our software products to the customers for which we acquired the
distribution rights from Innotech.

For almost all of our acquisitions of private companies, a
portion of the purchase price is payable after the acquired
business group’s achievement of certain performance goals,
which generally relate to one or more of the following: revenue,
bookings, product proliferation, product development and
employee retention. The specific performance goal levels and
amounts and timing of contingent purchase price payments vary
with each acquisition. In connection with some acquisitions, we
may grant equity awards with either time-based or
performance-based vesting, or a combination of both, to
employees of the acquired business as performance incentives. As
a result, the amount of cash consideration or shares of our
common stock issued to former stockholders of the acquired
entity will increase as performance goals are achieved,
generally over a period of up to four years following the
completion of the respective acquisition. Accordingly, goodwill
and stock compensation expense will increase upon the attainment
of such goals.

During 2004, we recorded $40.6 million of goodwill as
contingent purchase price payable to stockholders of acquired
companies. The $40.6 million of goodwill consisted of
$17.0 million of actual cash payments, $7.2 million of
accrued cash payments and the issuance of 1.1 million
shares of our common stock valued at $16.4 million. In
addition, we recognized stock compensation expense of
$1.2 million in connection with these acquisitions in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No. 44, “Accounting for Certain
Transactions Involving Stock Compensation (an Interpretation of
APB No. 25).” The additional goodwill and stock
compensation expense was related to the achievement of certain
performance goals associated with one or more of the following
criteria: revenue, bookings, product proliferation, product
development and employee retention. The portion of the earnout
associated with employee retention is recorded as compensation
expense.

During 2003, we paid $2.4 million in cash and issued or
reserved for issuance an additional 3.7 million shares of
our common stock valued at $57.7 million related to
acquisition earnouts. We recorded $52.3 million in
additional goodwill consisting of $2.4 million in cash and
$49.9 million representing the issuance or reserve for
issuance of 3.2 million shares. We also recorded additional
stock compensation expense of $7.8 million representing the
issuance or reserve for issuance of 0.4 million shares for
earnouts achieved during 2003. In addition, we recorded
$0.5 million in deferred stock compensation for estimated
future earnouts in accordance with FASB Interpretation
No. 28, “Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and
Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans.” The additional
goodwill and stock compensation expense related to the
achievement of certain performance goals associated with one or
more of the following criteria: revenue, bookings, product
proliferation, product development and employee retention. The
portion of the earnout associated with employee retention is
recorded as compensation expense.

In connection with our acquisitions completed prior to
January 1, 2005, we may be obligated to pay up to an
aggregate of $47.0 million in cash during the next
12 months and an additional $36.0 million in cash
during the three years following the next 12 months if
certain performance goals related to one or more of the
following criteria are achieved in full: revenue, bookings,
product proliferation, product development and employee
retention.

The goodwill recorded in connection with the above-described
contingent earnouts for acquisitions is not expected to be
deductible for income tax purposes.

Legal Settlements

In September 2003, we entered into a settlement with Mentor
Graphics Corporation, pursuant to which Cadence, Mentor and
their respective affiliated parties settled all outstanding
litigation between the companies and such affiliated parties
relating to emulation and acceleration systems. The companies
also agreed that, for a period of seven years, neither will sue
the other over patented emulation and acceleration technology.
Mentor also paid us $18.0 million in cash as part of the
settlement. Net of related legal costs, we recorded a gain of
$14.5 million during the year ended January 3, 2004
for the settlement.



In November 2002, we announced the settlement of civil
litigation filed against Avant! Corporation seeking damages
related to theft of our intellectual property, including
software code, as well as other trade secrets. The settlement
with Avant!, its parent corporation Synopsys, Inc. and several
individuals included an agreement to dismiss all pending claims
and counterclaims in the litigation and required the payment to
us of $265.0 million, which amount was received in the
fourth fiscal quarter of 2002. Net of related legal costs, we
recorded a gain of $261.1 million during the year ended
December 28, 2002 for the settlement.

Critical Accounting
Estimates

In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we make
assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant
impact on our revenue, operating income (loss) and net income
(loss), as well as on the value of certain assets and
liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We base our
assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience
and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under
the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a
regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and
estimates and make changes accordingly. We believe that the
assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting
for revenue recognition, accounting for income taxes, valuation
of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill and
restructuring charges have the greatest potential impact on our
Consolidated Financial Statements; therefore, we consider these
to be our critical accounting estimates. Historically, our
assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical
accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual
results. For further information on our significant accounting
policies, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Revenue recognition

We apply the provisions of Statement of Position, or SOP, 97-2,
“Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by
Statement of Position 98-9 “Modification of SOP 97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain
Transactions,” to all product revenue transactions where
the software is not incidental. We also apply the provisions of
SFAS, No. 13, “Accounting for Leases,” to all
hardware lease transactions. We recognize revenue when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has
been delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection of
the resulting receivable is probable, and vendor-specific
objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE, exists.

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement

— For
subscription and term licenses and hardware leases, we use the
signed contract as evidence of an arrangement. For perpetual
licenses, hardware sales, maintenance renewals and small
fixed-price service projects, such as training classes and
small, standard methodology service engagements of approximately
$10,000 or less, we use a purchase order as evidence of an
arrangement. For all other service engagements, we use a signed
professional services agreement and a statement of work to
evidence an arrangement. Sales through our distributors are
evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship,
together with binding purchase orders from the distributor on a
transaction-by-transaction basis.

Product delivery

— Software and the
corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers
electronically. Electronic delivery occurs when we provide the
customer access to the software. Occasionally, we will deliver
the software on a compact disc with standard transfer terms of
free-on-board shipping point. Our software license agreements
generally do not contain acceptance provisions. With respect to
hardware, delivery of an entire system is deemed to occur upon
its installation.

Fee is fixed or determinable

— We assess
whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the
arrangement, primarily based on the payment terms associated
with the transaction. We use installment contracts that extend
up to a maximum of five years from the contract date for certain
term and subscription licenses and we have established a history
of collecting under the original contract without providing
concessions on payments, products or services. Our installment
contracts that do not include a substantial up front payment
have payment periods that are equal to or less than the term of
the licenses and the payments are collected quarterly in equal
or nearly equal installments, when evaluated over the entire
term of the arrangement.



Significant judgment is involved in assessing whether a fee is
fixed or determinable, including assessing whether a contract
amendment constitutes a concession. Our experience has been that
we are able to determine whether a fee is fixed or determinable.
While we do not expect that experience to change, if we no
longer had a history of collecting under the original contract
without providing concessions on term licenses, revenue from
term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments
under the installment contract become due and payable. This
change could have a material impact on our results of operations.

Collection is probable

— We have concluded that
collection is not probable for license arrangements executed
with entities in certain countries. For all other countries, we
assess collectibility at the outset of the arrangement based on
a number of factors, including the customer’s past payment
history and its current creditworthiness. If in our judgment
collection of a fee is not probable, we defer the revenue until
the uncertainty is removed, which generally means revenue is
recognized upon our receipt of cash payment. Our experience has
been that we are able to estimate whether collection is
probable. While we do not expect that experience to change, if
we were to determine that collection is not probable for any
license arrangement with installment payment terms, revenue from
such license would be recognized generally upon the receipt of
cash payment. This change could have a material impact on our
results of operations.

Vendor-Specific Objective Evidence of Fair
Value

— Our VSOE for certain product elements of
an arrangement is based upon the pricing in comparable
transactions when the element is sold separately. VSOE for
maintenance is generally based upon the customer’s stated
annual renewal rates. VSOE for services is generally based on
the price charged when the services are sold separately. For
multiple element arrangements, VSOE must exist to allocate the
total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements in the
arrangement. If VSOE does not exist for all elements to support
the allocation of the total fee among all delivered and
undelivered elements of the arrangement, revenue is deferred
until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements, or
until all elements are delivered, whichever is earlier. If VSOE
of all undelivered elements exists but VSOE does not exist for
one or more delivered elements, revenue is recognized using the
residual method. Under the residual method, the VSOE of the
undelivered elements is deferred, and the remaining portion of
the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue as elements are
delivered. Our experience has been that we are able to estimate
VSOE. While we do not expect that experience to change, if we
could no longer support VSOE for undelivered elements of
multiple element arrangements, revenue would be deferred until
we have VSOE for the undelivered elements or all elements are
delivered, whichever is earlier. This change could have a
material impact on our results of operations.

Finance Fee Revenue

— Finance fees result from
discounting to present value the product revenue derived from
our installment contracts in which the payment terms extend
beyond one year from the contract effective date. Finance fees
are recognized ratably over the relevant license term and are
classified as product revenue. Finance fee revenue represented
2% of total revenue for 2004, 1% of total revenue for 2003 and
1% of total revenue for 2002.

Services revenue

— Services revenue consists
primarily of revenue received for performing methodology and
design services. These services are not related to the
functionality of our software licenses. Revenue from service
contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method,
as work is performed, or on the percentage-of-completion method.
For contracts with fixed or not-to-exceed fees, we estimate on a
monthly basis the percentage-of-completion, which is based on
the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement. We
have a history of accurately estimating project status and the
costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and
external factors can affect our estimates, including labor
rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification
and testing requirement changes. If different conditions were to
prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made, then the
use of the completed contract method would be required and the
recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the
project was completed. This change could have a material impact
on our results of operations.

Accounting for income taxes

We provide for the effect of income taxes in our Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with
SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.”
Under SFAS No. 109, income tax expense



(benefit) is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or
refundable for the current year, and for deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the tax consequences of events that have been
recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax
returns.

We must make significant assumptions, judgments and estimates to
determine our current provision for income taxes, our deferred
tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be
recorded against our deferred tax assets. Our judgments,
assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision for
income taxes take into account current tax laws, our
interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of
current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax
authorities. Changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax
laws and developments in current and future tax audits could
significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in
our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Our
assumptions, judgments and estimates, relating to the value of
our net deferred tax assets, take into account predictions of
the amount and category of future taxable income from potential
sources including tax planning strategies that would, if
necessary, be implemented to prevent a loss carryforward or tax
credit carryforward from expiring unused. Actual operating
results and the underlying amount and category of income in
future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and
estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate, thus
materially affecting our results of operations and financial
position.

See the factors affecting future results above in Item 1,
“Business” entitled “Our operating results could
be adversely affected as a result of changes in our effective
tax rates,” “We have received an examination report
from the Internal Revenue Service proposing a tax deficiency in
certain of our tax returns, and the outcome of the examination
or any future examinations involving similar claims may have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash
flows” and “Forecasting our estimated annual effective
tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty, and material
differences between forecasted and actual tax rates could have a
material impact on our results of operations.”

Valuation of long-lived and intangible assets, including
goodwill

At least annually we review goodwill resulting from business
combinations for impairment in accordance with
SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.”

Our annual impairment review process compares the fair value of
each reporting unit to its carrying value, including the
goodwill related to the reporting unit. To determine the
reporting unit’s fair value, we utilize a combination of
the income and market valuation approaches.

The income approach provides an estimate of fair value based on
the present value of expected future cash flows. These expected
future cash flows are based on our assumed market segment growth
rates, assumed market segment share growth rates, estimated
costs and appropriate discount rates based on the reporting
units’ weighted average cost of capital as determined by
considering the observable weighted average cost of capital of
comparable companies. Our estimates of market segment growth,
our market segment share growth and costs are based on
historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of
external sources, and are developed as part of our routine
long-range planning process.

The market approach provides an estimate of the fair value of
the equity of a business by comparing it to publicly traded
companies in similar lines of business. The conditions and
prospects of companies in similar lines of business depend on
common factors such as overall demand for their products and
services. Factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and
return on investment are also analyzed and compared to
comparable companies. Various price or market multiples are then
applied to our reporting units’ operating results to arrive
at an estimate of fair value.

In determining our overall conclusion of reporting unit fair
value, we considered the estimated values derived from both the
income and market valuation approaches. The weighting applied to
the market approach depends on the similarity of the comparable
businesses to the reporting unit.

We review long-lived assets, including certain identifiable
intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the
asset’s carrying amount in accordance with
SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”



For long-lived assets to be held and used, including acquired
intangibles, we initiate our review whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a
long-lived asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an
asset is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the
expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from
the use and eventual disposition of that asset, excluding future
interest costs that would be recognized as an expense when
incurred. Any impairment to be recognized is measured by the
amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its
fair market value. Significant management judgment is required
in:

•

identifying a triggering event that arises from a change in
    circumstances;

•

forecasting future operating results; and

•

estimating the proceeds from the disposition of long-lived or
    intangible assets.

Material impairment charges could be necessary should different
conditions prevail or different judgments be made.

Restructuring charges

We account for restructuring charges in accordance with SEC
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100, “Restructuring
and Impairment Charges.” Since fiscal 2001, we have
undertaken significant restructuring initiatives. All
restructuring activities initiated prior to fiscal 2003 were
accounted for in accordance with EITF No. 94-3,
“Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination
Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain
Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)” and EITF
No. 88-10, “Costs Associated with Lease Modifications
or Terminations.” For restructuring activities initiated
after fiscal 2002, we accounted for the facilities and
asset-related portions of these restructurings in accordance
with SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” In addition,
for all years presented, we accounted for the facilities and
asset-related portions of these restructurings in accordance
with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” The severance and
benefits charges were accounted for in accordance with
SFAS No. 112, “Employers’ Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits — An Amendment of FASB
Statements No. 5 and 43.”

These restructuring initiatives have required us to make a
number of estimates and assumptions related to losses on excess
facilities vacated or consolidated, particularly estimating
when, if at all, we will be able to sublet vacated facilities
and if we do, the sublease terms. Closure and space reduction
costs that are part of our restructuring charges include
payments required under leases, less any applicable estimated
sublease income after the facilities are abandoned, lease buyout
costs and certain contractual costs to maintain facilities
during the abandonment period.

In addition, we have recorded estimated provisions for
termination benefits and outplacement costs, and other
restructuring costs. We regularly evaluate the adequacy of our
restructuring accrual, and adjust the balance based on changes
in estimates and assumptions. We may incur future charges for
new restructuring activities as well as changes in estimates to
amounts previously recorded.

Results of Operations

We primarily generate revenue from licensing our EDA software
and selling or leasing hardware technology and intellectual
property, providing maintenance for our software and hardware
and providing design and methodology services. We principally
utilize three license types: subscription, term and perpetual.
The different license types provide a customer with different
rights to use our products such as (i) the right to access
new technology, (ii) the duration of the license, and
(iii) payment terms. Customer decisions regarding these
aspects of license transactions determine the license type,
timing of revenue recognition and potential future business
activity. For example, if a customer chooses a fixed term of
use, this will result in either a subscription or term license.
A business implication of that decision is that at the
expiration of the license period the customer must decide
whether to continue using the technology and therefore renew the
license agreement. Because larger customers generally use
products from two or more of our five product groups, rarely
will a large customer completely terminate its relationship with
us at expiration of the license. See



“Critical Accounting Estimates” above for additional
discussion of license types and timing of revenue recognition.

To the extent a customer obtains rights to remix to new
technology or more flexible payment terms, revenue is recognized
over the life of the agreement. This distinction is a critical
determinant of revenue recognition. For example, a
$3.0 million, 3-year product subscription license would
result in $1.0 million of revenue recognized per year, or
$250,000 per quarter. However, a $3.0 million, 3-year
product term license, assuming equal or near equal payments and
no rights to new technology, would result in $3.0 million
of revenue recognized upon delivery, which is generally in the
first quarter of the arrangement, and no revenue recognized in
succeeding quarters.

With each succeeding quarter in which the number of product
licenses where revenue recognition is deferred increases, our
revenue from backlog also increases. Product revenue recognized
from backlog comprised approximately 68% of total product
revenue in 2004, 60% in 2003 and 45% in 2002. As long as
customers continue to prefer subscription licenses, we expect
that revenue from backlog will increase and our revenue will be
less susceptible to short-term fluctuations in volume. Because
our model leads to a substantial portion of our revenue being
recognized over multiple periods, we do not believe that pricing
volatility has been a material component of the change in our
product revenue from period to period, and we have not analyzed
changes in pricing from one period to the next.

The amount of product revenue in future periods will depend,
among other things, on the terms and timing of our contract
renewals or additional product sales with existing customers,
the size of such transactions or renewals, and sales to new
customers. Product revenue in any period is also affected by the
extent to which customers prefer subscription, term or perpetual
licenses, and the extent to which contracts contain flexible
payment terms. Revenue is also affected by changes in the extent
to which existing contracts contain flexible payment terms and
changes in license types (e.g., subscription to term) for
existing customers. Contract renewals, and consequently product
revenues, are also affected by the competitiveness of our
products.

During 2005, we plan to continue optimizing our operations. In
the first quarter of 2005, we announced a plan of restructuring
that will reduce our workforce by approximately 200 employees.
This will result in an estimated restructuring and other expense
of approximately $18.0 million to $20.0 million in
2005. We expect ongoing annual savings of approximately
$30.0 million related to this plan of restructuring.

On January 12, 2005, we announced that we had signed a
definitive agreement to acquire Verisity Ltd., or Verisity, a
Mountain View, California-based provider of verification process
automation solutions. If completed, the merger will be accounted
for under the purchase method of accounting.

Under the terms of the agreement, upon satisfaction of the
closing conditions contained therein (including receipt of
certain governmental and Verisity shareholder approvals), we
will acquire Verisity in an all-cash transaction for
approximately $315.0 million to $335.0 million, which
consists of payments to stockholders and acquisition costs. Upon
closing of the acquisition, Verisity stockholders will receive
$12 in cash in exchange for each outstanding share of Verisity
stock.

Revenue and Revenue Mix by Product Group

We analyze our software and hardware businesses by product
group, combining revenues for both product and maintenance
because of their interrelationship. We have formulated a design
solution strategy that combines our design technologies into
“platforms,” which are included in the various product
groups described below. We introduced our first platform in
September 2002. The data described below for product groups for
periods before a platform was introduced aggregates the revenues
from the individual products associated with that particular
platform.

Our product groups are:

Functional Verification:

Products in this group, which
include the
Incisive

tm

functional verification platform, are used to verify that the
high level, logical specification of an integrated circuit
design is correct.



Digital IC Design:

Products in this group, which include
the
Encounter

tm

digital IC design platform, are used to accurately convert the
high-level, logical specification of a digital integrated
circuit into a detailed physical blueprint of the integrated
circuit, which is used for creation of the photomasks used in
chip manufacture.

Custom IC Design:

Our custom design products, which
include the Virtuoso® custom design platform, are used for
integrated circuits that must be designed at the transistor
level, including analog, radio frequency, memories, high
performance digital blocks, and standard cell libraries.

Design for Manufacturing:

Included in this product group
are our physical verification and analysis products. These
products are used to analyze and verify that the physical
blueprint of the integrated circuit has been constructed
correctly and can be manufactured successfully.

System Interconnect:

This product group consists of our
printed circuit board and integrated circuit package design
products, including the Allegro® system interconnect design
platform, which enables consistent co-design of integrated
circuits, IC packages, and printed circuit boards.

Revenue by Year

The table below shows our revenue for the years ended 2004, 2003
and 2002:

2004 compared to 2003

Product revenue was higher in 2004, as compared to 2003,
primarily because of increased revenue from licenses for Digital
IC and System Interconnect products and sales of certain
intellectual property. Services revenue increased in 2004 due to
an increase in customer spending for design services as the
electronics industry experienced some recovery from the economic
downturn of 2002 and 2003.

2003 compared to 2002

Product revenue was lower in 2003, as compared to 2002, due to
the shift to more ratable licenses and lower sales volume.
Services revenue was lower in 2003, as compared to 2002, due to
a decrease in customer spending for design services as a result
of the economic downturn experienced in the electronics industry
at that time.



Revenue by Product Group

The following table shows for 2004, 2003 and 2002 the percentage
of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each
of our five product groups, and Services and other:

During 2004, we recognized $11.0 million of revenue from
the sale of intellectual property, or IP. This sale of IP is
included in Services and other in the preceding table and in
Product revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of
Operations.

Revenue by Geography

Revenue by Geography as a Percent of Total Revenue

The rate of revenue change varies geographically due to
differences in the timing and extent of term license renewals
for existing customers in those regions. In addition, both our
domestic and international businesses have been affected by the
revenue trends discussed above in this section entitled
“Results of Operations.”

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates caused our revenue to
increase by $16.0 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, and
to increase by $18.8 million in 2003, as compared to 2002,
primarily due to



strengthening of the Japanese yen in relation to the
U.S. dollar. Additional information about revenue and other
financial information by geography can be found in Note 19
to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cost of product includes costs associated with the sale or lease
of our hardware and licensing of our software products. Cost of
product primarily includes the cost of employee salaries and
benefits, amortization of intangible assets directly related to
Cadence products, the cost of technical documentation and
royalties payable to third-party vendors. Cost of product
associated with our Cadence Verification Acceleration, or CVA,
hardware products also includes materials, assembly labor and
overhead. These additional manufacturing costs make our cost of
hardware product higher, as a percentage of revenue, than our
cost of software product.

A summary of Cost of product is as follows:

2004 compared to 2003

Cost of product increased $15.0 million in 2004, as
compared to 2003, primarily due to an increase of
$18.0 million in cost of goods sold for our hardware
business resulting from increased sales of our hardware
products, and an increase of $5.0 million in amortization
of intangible assets, partially offset by a $4.4 million
decrease in royalty expenses and a $3.6 million decrease in
amortized software costs.

Cost of product in the future will depend primarily upon the
actual mix of hardware and software product contracts in any
given period and the degree to which we license and incorporate
third-party technology in our products licensed or sold in any
given period.

Cost of services primarily includes employee salary and
benefits, costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to
manage a services organization, and provisions for contract
losses, if any. Cost of services decreased $2.2 million in
2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to a decrease in salary
and benefit costs resulting from decreases in employees in our
services business. Services gross margin as a percentage of
services revenue increased during 2004, as compared to 2003, due
to increased services revenues and decreased cost of services.



Cost of maintenance includes the cost of customer services, such
as hot-line and on-site support, production employees and
documentation of maintenance updates. Cost of maintenance
revenue decreased $3.5 million in 2004, as compared to
2003, due to a $2.3 million decrease in salary and benefit
costs and a $1.2 million decrease in information
technology, facilities and general operating expenses.

2003 compared to

Cost of product decreased $31.3 million in 2003, as
compared to 2002, primarily due to an $18.9 million
reduction in amortized software costs, an $8.3 million
decrease in royalties expense, a $9.3 million decrease in
inventory write-offs, and a $2.2 million decrease in
acquisition-related write-offs. The decreases were partially
offset by an increase in amortization of acquired intangibles of
$13.8 million during 2003.

Cost of services decreased $21.5 million in 2003, as
compared to 2002, primarily due to decreases in employee salary
and benefit costs resulting from our reduction of services
professionals in connection with our restructuring actions
initiated in 2002 and 2003. As a result, services gross margin
as a percentage of services revenue increased during 2003, as
compared to 2002.

Cost of maintenance decreased $8.6 million in 2003, as
compared to 2002, primarily due to a decrease in employee salary
and benefit costs resulting from a decrease in employee
headcount.

Operating Expense Summary

2004 compared to

Operating expenses increased $11.3 million during 2004, as
compared to 2003, primarily due to a $31.8 million increase
in employee salaries and benefits and related costs, primarily
due to bonuses earned in 2004 that had not been earned in 2003.
This increase was partially offset by a $13.2 million
decrease in depreciation and amortization expense, a
$7.4 million decrease in outside services and a
$7.2 million decrease in commission payments to Innotech
Corporation, or Innotech, as a result of our acquisition from
Innotech in 2003 of distribution rights to certain of its
customers.

Foreign currency exchange rates increased operating expenses by
$10.9 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due
to the strengthening of the euro, British pound and Japanese yen
in relation to the U.S. dollar.

We expect our operating expenses to increase in 2005 as compared
to 2004 due to our pending acquisition of Verisity Ltd.



2003 compared to

Operating expenses declined $95.0 million during 2003, as
compared to 2002, as a result of the cost reductions from our
2003 and 2002 restructuring activities described more fully
below in “Restructuring and Other Charges.”

Foreign currency exchange rates increased operating expenses by
$11.3 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due
to the strengthening of the euro and British pound in relation
to the U.S. dollar.

Marketing and Sales

2004 compared to

Marketing and sales expenses decreased $0.7 million during
2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to a $7.2 million
decrease in commission payments to Innotech as a result of our
acquisition from Innotech of distribution rights to certain of
its customers and a $3.1 million reduction in depreciation
related to prior restructuring activities. This decrease was
partially offset by a $7.7 million increase in employee
salaries and benefits and related costs and a $2.2 million
increase in marketing program costs.

2003 compared to

Marketing and sales expenses decreased $75.5 million during
2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to a $27.8 million
decrease in employee salaries and benefits and related costs
resulting from our restructuring activities, a
$16.1 million decrease in commission costs, a
$12.6 million decrease in outside services costs, and a
$4.1 million decrease in marketing program costs. Salary,
benefits and commission costs declined due to reduced headcount
in the sales and marketing organizations. Outside services costs
declined due to decreased commission payments to Innotech and a
reduction in costs incurred for outside contractors and
consultants.

Research and Development

2004 compared to

Research and development expense increased $11.2 million
during 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to a
$21.4 million increase in employee salaries and benefits
and related costs resulting from an increase in employees due to
business acquisitions and increased staffing to support
strategic technologies. This increase was partially offset by a
$7.4 million decrease in expenses related to our use of
outside services and a $3.2 million decrease in costs
associated with outsourced research and development projects.

2003 compared to

The increase in Research and development expense of
$13.7 million for 2003, as compared to 2002, was primarily
due to a $14.1 million increase in employee salaries and
benefits and related costs resulting from an increase in
employees due to business acquisitions and increased staffing to
support strategic technologies and an $18.9 million
reduction in capitalized development costs, partially offset by
an $11.5 million reduction in costs related to outsourced
services and research and development projects as a result of
the restructuring activities, and a $5.6 million decrease
in expenses related to our use of other outside services.

General and Administrative

2004 compared to

General and administrative expense increased $0.8 million
in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to a
$4.5 million increase in employee salaries and benefits and
related costs and a $2.6 million increase in professional
fees related to our annual audit and Sarbanes-Oxley
Section 404 compliance. This increase was partially offset
by a $2.6 million decrease in legal expenses, a
$2.4 million decrease in bad debt expense and a
$1.3 million decrease in insurance expense.



2003 compared to

General and administrative expense decreased $33.2 million
in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to a
$16.6 million decrease in legal expense, a
$9.3 million decrease in salary and benefit costs in
connection with our restructuring activities and a
$2.2 million decrease in bad debt expense. The allowance
for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total receivables
declined in 2003, as compared to 2002, because write-offs
continued to decline and because of additional reductions in the
percentage of receivables past due. There were no significant
changes in our collection policies or payment terms from 2002 to
2003.

2004 compared to

Amortization of acquired intangibles decreased $6.9 million

$11.4 million decrease in the amortization of acquired
intangibles reflecting the full amortization of intangible
assets from prior year acquisitions, partially offset by
increases of $5.6 million in amortization of acquired
intangibles in connection with our previously completed
acquisitions. We expect an increase in the amortization of
acquired intangibles in 2005 due to the pending acquisition of
Verisity Ltd. as described more fully in Note 20 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

2003 compared to

Amortization of acquired intangibles increased $8.8 million
in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to a

compensation expense related to variable awards using an
accelerated method over the period that the stock options and
restricted stock are earned.

2004 compared to

Amortization of deferred stock compensation decreased
$9.7 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, due to a
$24.6 million decrease in the amortization of deferred
stock compensation primarily related to our previously completed
acquisitions. This decrease was partially offset by a
$14.9 million increase in the amortization of deferred
stock compensation primarily related to incentive stock grants.
We expect that amortization of deferred stock compensation will
increase in 2005 due to increased incentive stock grants during
2004 and our adoption of SFAS No. 123R in our third
quarter of 2005 as described more fully in “New Accounting
Standards” below.

2003 compared to

Amortization of deferred stock compensation decreased
$2.9 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, primarily due to
a $14.8 million decrease in the amortization of deferred
stock compensation related to our previously completed
acquisitions. This decrease was partially offset by a
$4.3 million increase in the



amortization of deferred stock compensation related to Verplex,
and a $2.2 million increase in the amortization of deferred
stock compensation related to the mark-to-market of options
granted to consultants.

Restructuring and Other Charges

We have initiated a separate plan of restructuring in each year
since 2001 in an effort to reduce operating expenses and improve
operating margins and cash flows.

The restructuring plans initiated in 2001, 2002 and 2003, or the
2001 Restructuring, 2002 Restructuring and 2003 Restructuring,
respectively, were intended to decrease costs by reducing
workforce and consolidating facilities and resources, to align
our cost structure with expected revenues. The 2001 and 2002
Restructurings primarily related to our design services business
and certain other business or infrastructure groups throughout
the world. The 2003 Restructuring was targeted at reducing costs
throughout the company.

During 2004, we commenced a new plan of restructuring, or the
2004 Restructuring, which was also intended to decrease costs
and realize efficiencies by reducing workforce and resources
throughout the company to align our cost structure with expected
revenues.

A summary of restructuring and other charges by plan of
restructuring for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002 is as follows:

Frequently, asset impairments are based on significant estimates
and assumptions, particularly regarding remaining useful life
and utilization rates. We may incur other charges in the future
if management determines that the useful life or utilization of
certain long-lived assets has been reduced.

Closure and space reduction costs included payments required
under leases less any applicable estimated sublease income after
the properties were abandoned, lease buyout costs, and costs to
maintain facilities during the abandonment period. To determine
the lease loss, which is the loss after our cost recovery
efforts from subleasing a building, certain assumptions were
made related to the time period over which the relevant building
would remain vacant and sublease terms, including sublease rates
and contractual common area charges.

As of January 1, 2005, our best estimate of the accrued
lease loss related to all worldwide restructuring activities
initiated since 2001 is $33.7 million. This amount will be
adjusted in the future based upon changes



in the assumptions used to estimate the lease loss. The lease
loss could range as high as $53.2 million if sublease
rental rates decrease in applicable markets or if it takes
longer than currently expected to find a suitable tenant to
sublease the facilities. Since 2001, we have recorded facilities
consolidation charges under the 2001 through 2004 Restructurings
of $85.2 million related to reducing space in or the
closing of 34 sites, of which 24 have been vacated and 10 have
been downsized.

Because the restructuring charges and related benefits are
derived from management’s estimates made during the
formulation of the restructurings, based on then-currently
available information, our restructuring activities may not
achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the
level contemplated. Demand for our products and services and,
ultimately, our future financial performance, is difficult to
predict with any degree of certainty. Accordingly, additional
actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may
be required in the future.

The following is further discussion of the activity under each
restructuring plan:

During 2005, we plan to continue optimizing our operations. In
the first quarter of 2005, we announced a plan of restructuring
that will reduce our workforce by approximately 200 employees.
This will result in an estimated restructuring and other expense
of approximately $18.0 million to $20.0 million in
2005. We expect ongoing annual savings of approximately
$30.0 million related to this plan of restructuring.

2004 Restructuring

— The 2004 Restructuring
resulted in the termination of approximately 130 employees.
Costs resulting from this restructuring included severance
payments, severance-related benefits and outplacement services.
All terminations and termination benefits associated with this
restructuring were communicated to the affected employees prior
to January 1, 2005, with all termination benefits expected
to be paid by July 2, 2005.

We project annualized savings in employee salary and benefits
costs of approximately $20.0 million resulting from
employee terminations under the 2004 Restructuring.

Other expenses of $9.4 million related to the abandonment
of third-party software purchased and integrated an into an
internal-use software application. During 2004, we replaced this
third-party purchased software with internally developed
technology. Upon deployment of the internally developed software
we recorded a charge to reduce the value of the third-party
software product and implementation costs to zero.

2003 Restructuring

— During 2004, we recorded a
net credit of $2.1 million related to the 2003
Restructuring. This net credit is comprised of a
$2.8 million credit associated with asset-related charges,
and a $0.8 million severance and benefits credit, partially
offset by $1.5 million of additional excess facilities
charges.

The net $2.8 million asset-related credit was associated
with the reversal of an accrual of approximately
$4.6 million for an expected payment to a government agency
because we have determined it is not probable we will have any
future liability. This reversal was partially offset by a
$1.2 million accrual for fees related to headcount
reductions at a foreign facility. We also reversed
$0.8 million of the severance-related accrual related to
payroll taxes, benefits and outplacement services in excess of
the remaining expected obligation.

We incurred excess facilities expenses of $1.5 million in
the year ended January 1, 2005 related to the 2003
Restructuring. These expenses were primarily comprised of
additional expenses incurred for facilities included in the 2003
Restructuring, but vacated during fiscal 2004. Expenses also
included contract termination charges and expenses incurred to
sublease facilities and storage and disposal charges associated
with facilities vacated as part of the 2003 Restructuring.

We expect to incur an additional $4.0 million to
$6.0 million of future costs in connection with the 2003
Restructuring, primarily for facilities-related charges, which
will be expensed as incurred. The actual amount of additional
costs incurred could vary depending on changes in market
conditions and the timing of these restructuring activities.

2002 Restructuring

— During 2004, we recorded a
net credit of $1.6 million related to the 2002
Restructuring. This net credit is comprised of the reversal of
$1.2 million of accrued contract termination costs



not incurred and $0.4 million of the severance and benefits
accrual in excess of the remaining expected obligation,
partially offset by $0.1 million of additional excess
facilities charges.

2001 Restructuring

— We recorded
facilities-related expenses of $0.6 million during 2004
primarily due to changes in lease loss estimates and costs
associated with facilities vacated as part of the 2001
restructuring plan.

Write-off of Acquired In-Process Research and
Development

Upon consummation of an acquisition, we immediately charge to
expense any acquired in-process research and development that
has not yet reached technological feasibility and has no
alternative future use. The value assigned to acquired
in-process research and development is determined by identifying
research projects in areas for which technological feasibility
has not been established. The values are determined by
estimating costs to develop the acquired in-process research and
development into commercially viable products, estimating the
resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the
net cash flows back to their present value. The discount rates
utilized include a factor that reflects the uncertainty
surrounding successful development of the acquired in-process
research and development.

Described below are the write-offs of acquired in-process
research and development charges in 2004, 2003 and 2002:

We expect an increase in Write-off of acquired in-process
research and development in 2005, as compared to 2004, assuming
our pending acquisition of Verisity Ltd. is completed.



Described below is a summary of in-process research and
development acquired during 2004, 2003 and 2002 as of
January 1, 2005:

associated with the issuance of our Zero Coupon Zero Yield
Senior Convertible Notes, or the Notes, in August 2003, an
increase of $1.3 million in imputed interest on
acquisition-related payments which occur over time, partially
offset by a decrease of $1.9 million in interest expense
related to our credit facilities that were terminated in 2003
after the issuance of the Notes.

2003 compared to 2002

Interest expense increased $2.2 million in 2003, as
compared to 2002, primarily due to an increase of
$1.7 million in imputed interest on acquisition-related
payments which occur over time and an increase of
$0.8 million of amortization expense related to the costs
associated with the issuance of our Notes, partially offset by a
decrease of $0.3 million in interest expense related to our
credit facilities that were terminated in 2003 after the
issuance of the Notes.



Other expense, net

Other expense, net, for the years ended 2004, 2003 and 2002 is
as follows:

In 2004, the Other income of $4.2 million is comprised of
$12.5 million of gains on the sale of investments and
$0.4 million of other income, net, offset by
$4.2 million of impairment of investments,
$2.5 million of investment management fees paid to manage
the Telos venture partnerships described under “Liquidity
and Capital Resources” below and $2.0 million of
losses on the sale of receivables. In 2003, the Other expense of
$10.4 million is comprised of $4.8 million of
impairment of investments, $5.0 million of losses on the
sale of receivables and $0.6 million of Other expense, net.
In 2002, the Other expense of $8.7 million is comprised of
$14.1 million of impairment of investments,
$15.1 million of losses on the sale of receivables,
$24.9 million of gains on the sale of investments and
$4.4 million of Other expense, net. We expect our equity in
loss from investments, net, to decrease in 2005 as a result of
the adoption of EITF No. 02-14 as more fully described in
Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes and the effective tax rates for
2004, 2003 and 2002 are as follows:

2004 compared to 2003

The income before provision for income taxes resulted in a
provision for income taxes in 2004 compared to a benefit for
income taxes in 2003. The 2004 provision for income taxes has a
greater benefit from foreign income that is taxed at a lower
rate than the U.S. federal statutory rate when compared to
2003.

2003 compared to 2002

The loss before provision for income taxes resulted in a benefit
for income taxes in 2003 compared to a provision for income
taxes in 2002. The 2003 benefit has a greater detriment from
non-deductible amortization of stock compensation expense
partially offset by a greater benefit from foreign income that
is taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. federal statutory
rate in comparison to 2002.

Outlook for 2005

Excluding the impact of the potential acquisition of Verisity
Ltd., we are currently projecting an increase in our effective
income tax rate for 2005 primarily due to a reduced benefit from
foreign income taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. federal
statutory rate in comparison to 2004. We are not yet in a
position to reasonably estimate the effective income tax rate
for 2005 as we are currently studying the impact of certain new
tax rules in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or AJCA,
the pending adoption of SFAS No. 123R, and the
completion of our pending acquisition of Verisity Ltd.



The total valuation allowance on deferred tax assets increased
by $0.6 million during 2004. As of January 1, 2005,
the valuation allowance is $7.8 million and is related to
deferred tax assets for certain states where realization is not
judged to be likely.

As of January 1, 2005, we had total net deferred tax assets
of approximately $106.8 million. Realization of the
deferred tax assets will depend on generating sufficient taxable
income of the appropriate character prior to the expiration of
certain net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Although realization is not assured, we believe
it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will
be realized. The amount of the net deferred tax assets, however,
could be reduced or increased in the near term if actual facts,
including the estimate of future taxable income, differ from
those estimated.

We currently intend to indefinitely reinvest our undistributed
foreign earnings and, accordingly, have not provided for the
U.S. or foreign taxes that would be incurred if such
earnings were repatriated to the U.S. The AJCA, enacted on
October 22, 2004, created a temporary incentive for
U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated earnings of
foreign subsidiaries by providing an 85% dividends received
deduction for certain qualifying dividends. The deduction is
subject to a number of limitations. Although no decision has
been made regarding repatriation of foreign earnings under the
AJCA, we may elect to apply this provision to qualifying
earnings repatriated during fiscal 2005. We are currently
evaluating the merits of repatriating funds under the AJCA and
expect to complete this evaluation by October 1, 2005. The
range of possible amounts that we are considering for
repatriation under this provision is between zero and
$550.0 million. We have historically considered
undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be
indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, have not provided for
income taxes on these undistributed earnings. If we decide to
repatriate foreign earnings in a future period, we will be
required to recognize income tax expense related to the federal,
state, local and foreign income taxes that we would incur on the
repatriated earnings when the decision is made. We are currently
unable to reasonably estimate the possible range of income tax
effects of such repatriation.

The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine our income
tax returns. In November 2003, the IRS completed its field
examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years
1997 through 1999 and issued a Revenue Agent’s Report, or
the RAR, in which the IRS proposes to assess an aggregate tax
deficiency for the three-year period of approximately
$143.0 million, plus interest, which interest will accrue
until the matter is resolved. This interest is compounded daily
at rates published by the IRS, which rates have been between
four and nine percent since 1997, and are adjusted quarterly.
The IRS may also make similar claims for years subsequent to
1999 in future examinations. The RAR is not a final Statutory
Notice of Deficiency, and we have protested certain of the
proposed adjustments with the Appeals Office of the IRS where
the matter is presently being considered. The most significant
of the disputed adjustments relates to transfer pricing
arrangements that we have with a foreign subsidiary. We believe
that the proposed IRS adjustments are inconsistent with the
applicable tax laws, and that we have meritorious defenses to
the proposed adjustments. We intend to challenge these proposed
adjustments vigorously.

The IRS is currently examining our federal income tax returns
for the tax years 2000 through 2002.

Significant judgment is required in determining our provision
for income taxes. In determining the adequacy of our provision
for income taxes, we have assessed the likelihood of adverse
outcomes resulting from these examinations, including the
current IRS examination and the IRS RAR for tax years 1997
through 1999. However, the ultimate outcome of tax examinations
cannot be predicted with certainty, including the total amount
payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of
these issues. In addition, we cannot be certain that such amount
will not be materially different than that which is reflected in
our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Should the
IRS or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result
of a current or a future examination, we may be required to
record charges to operations in future periods that could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
position or cash flows in the period or periods recorded.



Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
relates primarily to our short-term investment portfolio. While
we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the
world’s leading industrialized countries, our interest
income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the
general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard,
changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned
on our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term
investments and costs associated with foreign currency hedges.

We invest in high quality credit issuers and, by policy, limit
the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer. As part of
our policy, our first priority is to reduce the risk of
principal loss. Consequently, we seek to preserve our invested
funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment
risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality
credit securities that we believe to have low credit risk and by
positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a
significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment
issuer or guarantor. The short-term interest-bearing portfolio
includes only marketable securities with active secondary or
resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity.

The table below presents the carrying value and related weighted
average interest rates for our interest-bearing instruments. All
highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash
equivalents; investments with maturities between three and
12 months are considered to be short-term investments. Held
to maturity investments with maturities greater than
12 months are considered long-term investments. The
carrying value of our interest-bearing instruments approximated
fair value at January 1, 2005.

Foreign Currency Risk

Our operations include transactions in foreign currencies and,
therefore, we benefit from a weaker dollar, and we are adversely
affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies
worldwide. The primary effect of foreign currency transactions
on our results of operations from a weakening U.S. dollar
is an increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in
expenses. Conversely, the primary effect of foreign currency
transactions on our results of operations from a strengthening
U.S. dollar is a reduction in revenue offset by a smaller
reduction in expenses. Foreign currency fluctuations positively
impacted our income by $3.7 million in 2004, as compared to
2003, and $2.6 million in 2003, as compared to 2002.

We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with
financial institutions to protect against currency exchange
risks associated with existing assets and liabilities. A foreign
currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing
in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying
liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange
rates. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract
decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or
underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in
foreign exchange rates. These forward contracts are not
designated as accounting hedges under SFAS No. 133
and, therefore, the unrealized gains and losses are recognized
in Other expense, net, in advance of the actual foreign currency
cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being
recorded as accrued liabilities.



Our policy governing hedges of foreign currency risk does not
allow us to use forward contracts for trading purposes. Our
forward contracts generally have maturities of 180 days or
less. Recognized gains and losses with respect to our current
hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we
are able to match the amount of currency forward exchange
contracts with underlying asset and liability exposures.

The table below provides information, as of January 1,
2005, about our forward foreign currency contracts. The
information is provided in U.S. dollar equivalent amounts.
The table presents the notional amounts, at contract exchange
rates, and the weighted average contractual foreign currency
exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per
U.S. dollar, which in some cases may not be the market
convention for quoting a particular currency. All of these
forward contracts mature prior to March 18, 2005.

While we actively monitor our foreign currency risks, there can
be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities
will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency
exchange rates on our results of operations, cash flows and
financial position.

Equity Price Risk

In August 2003, we issued $420.0 million principal amount
of the Notes to two initial purchasers in a private offering for
resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC
Rule 144A, for which we received net proceeds of
approximately $406.4 million after transaction fees of
approximately $13.6 million. The Notes are convertible into
our common stock initially at a conversion price of
$15.65 per share, which would result in an aggregate of
26.8 million shares issued upon conversion, subject to
adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. We may
redeem for cash all or any part of the Notes on or after
August 15, 2008 for 100.00% of the principal amount. The
holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion
of their Notes on August 15, 2008 for 100.25% of the
principal amount, on August 15, 2013 for 100.00% of the
principal amount or on August 15, 2018 for 100.00% of the
principal amount. The Notes do not contain restrictive financial
covenants.

Each $1,000 of principal of the Notes will initially be
convertible into 63.879 shares of our common stock, subject
to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders
of the Notes may convert their Notes prior to maturity only if:
(1) the price of our common stock reaches $22.69 during
certain periods of time specified in the Notes,
(2) specified corporate transactions occur, (3) the
Notes have been called for redemption or (4) the trading
price of the Notes falls below a certain threshold. As of
January 1, 2005, none of the conditions allowing holders of
the Notes to convert had been met.

In addition, in the event of a significant change in our
corporate ownership or structure, the holders may require us to
repurchase all or any portion of their Notes for 100% of the
principal amount.



Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into
convertible notes hedge transactions with JP Morgan Chase
Bank, whereby we have the option to purchase up to
26.8 million shares of our common stock at a price of
$15.65 per share. These options expire on August 15,
2008 and must be settled in net shares. The cost of the
convertible notes hedge transactions to us was approximately
$134.6 million. As of January 1, 2005, the estimated
fair value of the convertible notes hedge transactions was
$100.8 million.

In addition, we sold to JP Morgan Chase Bank warrants to
purchase up to 26.8 million shares of our common stock at a
price of $23.08 per share. The warrants expire on various
dates from February 2008 through May 2008 and must be settled in
net shares. We received approximately $56.4 million in cash
proceeds for the sales of these warrants. As of January 1,
2005, the estimated fair value of the sold warrants was
$32.2 million.

For additional discussion of the Notes see “Liquidity and
Capital Resources” below.

We have a portfolio of equity investments that includes
marketable equity securities and non-marketable equity
securities. Our equity investments primarily are made in
privately-held companies either as direct investments or through
our Telos venture partnerships described under “Liquidity
and Capital Resources” below. From time to time we make
cash investments in companies with distinctive technologies that
are potentially strategically important to us.

The fair value of our portfolio of marketable equity securities,
which are included in Short-term investments in the accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements, was $35.9 million as of
January 1, 2005 and $33.6 million as of
January 3, 2004. While we actively monitor these
investments, we do not currently engage in any hedging
activities to reduce or eliminate equity price risk with respect
to these equity investments. Accordingly, we could lose all or
part of our investment portfolio of marketable equity securities
if there is an adverse change in the market prices of the
companies we invest in.

Our investments in non-marketable equity securities would be
negatively affected by an adverse change in equity market
prices, although the impact cannot be directly quantified. Such
a change, or any negative change in the financial performance or
prospects of the companies whose non-marketable securities we
own would harm the ability of these companies to raise
additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to
realize any gains or return of our investments through liquidity
events such as initial public offerings, acquisitions and
private sales. These types of investments involve a high degree
of risk, and there can be no assurance that any company we
invest in will grow or will be successful. Accordingly, we could
lose all or part of our investment.

Our investments in non-marketable equity securities had a
carrying amount of $45.7 million as of January 1, 2005
and $53.3 million as of January 3, 2004. If we
determine that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value
exists for a non-marketable equity security, we write down the
investment to its fair value and record the related write-down
as an investment loss in our Consolidated Statements of
Operations.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments

During the fourth quarter of 2004, we reclassified auction rate
securities of $75.4 million as of January 3, 2004 and
$15.0 million as of December 28, 2002 from Cash and
cash equivalents to Short-term investments on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets. We have reclassified the purchases and sales of
these auction rate securities in our Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows, which decreased Cash flows from investing activities
by $60.4 million for the year ended January 3, 2004
and $15.0 million for the year ended December 28, 2002.

At January 1, 2005, our principal sources of liquidity
consisted of $593.0 million of Cash and cash equivalents
and Short-term investments, as compared to $418.4 million
at January 3, 2004 and $395.6 million at
December 28, 2002. The primary sources of our cash in 2004
and 2003 were customer payments under software licenses and from
the sale or lease of our hardware products, payments for the
provision of design and methodology services, proceeds from the
issuance of convertible notes in 2003, proceeds from the sale of
receivables and from the exercise of stock options and common
stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plans. Our
primary uses of cash in 2004 and 2003 consisted of payments
relating to payroll, product, services and other operating
expenses, taxes, the hedge for our convertible notes to manage
equity dilution, purchases of treasury stock and business
acquisitions.

Net working capital

At January 1, 2005, we had net working capital of
$521.0 million, as compared with $360.3 million at
January 3, 2004 and $254.3 million at
December 28, 2002. The increase in net working capital from
2003 to 2004 was primarily due to the increase in Cash and cash
equivalents and Short-term investments of $174.6 million,
an increase in Receivables, net, of $35.4 million, and an
increase in Prepaid expense and other of $14.1 million,
partially offset by an increase of Accounts payable and accrued
liabilities of $34.5 million and an increase in Deferred
revenue of $32.5 million.

The increase in net working capital from 2002 to 2003 was
primarily due to a decrease in Accounts payable and accrued
liabilities of $51.9 million, an increase in Receivables,
net, of $34.7 million, and an increase in Cash and cash
equivalents and Short-term investments of $22.8 million,
partially offset by an increase in Deferred revenue of
$30.7 million.

Cash flows from operating activities

Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly
influenced by the payment terms set forth in our license
agreements. For a term license in which revenue is recognized
upon delivery, payment of a substantial portion of the fee must
be paid in the first year of the license. Our installment
contracts that do not include a substantial up front payment
have payment periods that are equal to or less than the term of
the licenses and



the payments are collected quarterly in equal or nearly equal
installments, when evaluated over the entire term of the
arrangement.

We have entered into agreements whereby we may transfer
qualifying accounts receivable to certain financing institutions
on a non-recourse basis. These transfers are recorded as sales
and accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 140,
“Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
and Extinguishments of Liabilities.” During 2004, we
transferred accounts receivable totaling $30.1 million,
which approximated fair value, to financing institutions on a
non-recourse basis, as compared to $87.4 million in 2003
and $182.0 million in 2002.

Provision for sales returns is accounted for as a reduction of
revenue. Provision for sales returns decreased $8.5 million
in 2004, as compared to 2003, and increased $1.2 million in
2003, as compared to 2002.

2004 compared to

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by
$201.5 million, to $372.5 million, during 2004, as
compared to $171.0 million net cash provided by operating
activities during 2003. The increase from 2003 to 2004 is
primarily due to an increase in net income of
$92.0 million, an increase in cash received from
Installment contract receivables of $128.5 million, a
decrease in payments associated with Accounts payable and
accrued liabilities of $108.7 million, partially offset by
a decrease in Proceeds from the sale of receivables of
$57.3 million and a decrease of cash collected on Accounts
receivable, net of $48.0 million.

2003 compared to

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by
$176.7 million, to $171.0 million, during 2003, as
compared to $347.7 million net cash provided by operating
activities during 2002. The decrease from 2002 to 2003 is
primarily due to a reduction in net income of
$77.9 million, a decrease in deferred income taxes of
$35.9 million and a $26.5 million reduction in
write-off of acquired in-process research and development.

Cash flows from investing activities

Our primary investing activities consisted of business
acquisitions, purchasing property, plant and equipment,
purchasing software licenses, purchasing technology and
investing in venture capital partnership and equity investments,
which combined represented $203.9 million of cash used for
investing activities in 2004, as compared to $338.4 million
in 2003 and $175.4 million in 2002.

As part of our overall investment strategy, we are a limited
partner in three venture capital funds, Telos Venture Partners,
L.P., or Telos I, Telos Venture Partners II, L.P., or
Telos II, and Telos Venture Partners III, L.P., or
Telos III (Telos I, Telos II and Telos III
are referred to collectively as Telos).

We and certain of our deferred compensation trusts are the sole
limited partners of Telos I and Telos III, and we are the
sole limited partner of Telos II. The partnership agreements
governing Telos I, Telos II and Telos III, which
are substantially the same, require us to meet capital calls
principally for the purpose of funding investments that are
recommended by the applicable Telos general partner, and
approved by the Telos advisory committee as being consistent
with the partnership’s limitations and stated purposes. The
Telos general partner, which is not affiliated with us, manages
the partnerships and may be removed by us without cause. For all
three partnerships, the advisory committee is comprised solely
of the members of the Venture Committee of our Board of
Directors, the current members of which are our Chairman of the
Board of Directors and two independent members of our Board of
Directors.

As of January 1, 2005, we had contributed
$96.3 million to these partnerships and are contractually
committed to contribute to them up to an additional
$69.1 million. Actual future contributions will depend upon
the level of investments made by Telos. Our commitments expire
concurrently with the termination date of each partnership,
which, in the case of Telos I, is December 31, 2005,
in the case of Telos II, is July 3, 2012, and, in the
case of Telos III, is June 1, 2012. Our investments in
the Telos partnerships are recorded in Other assets in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.



2004 compared to

Net cash used for investing activities decreased by
$171.3 million, to $215.0 million, during 2004, as
compared to $386.3 million net cash used for investing
activities during 2003. The decrease from 2003 to 2004 is
primarily due to a decrease of $67.1 million of net cash
paid in business acquisitions, a decrease of $17.0 million
of investments in venture capital partnership and equity
investments, a decrease of $29.3 million in purchases of
technology, a decrease of $21.1 million in purchases of
property, plant and equipment, an increase of $98.6 million
of sales of short-term investments and an increase of proceeds
from the sale of available for sale securities and long-term
investments of $14.9 million, partially offset by an
increase of $71.2 million of purchases of short-term
investments.

During 2003, we received $9.1 million in cash from the
sale-leaseback of certain equipment. We will make aggregate
payments under the resulting operating leases of
$9.1 million over the three to five year life of the
operating leases.

2003 compared to

Net cash used for investing activities increased by
$235.2 million, to $386.3 million, during 2003, as
compared to $151.1 million net cash used for investing
activities during 2002. The increase from 2002 to 2003 is
primarily due to an increase of $147.6 million of net cash
paid in business acquisitions, an increase of
$448.7 million in purchases of short-term investments, a
decrease of $49.4 million of proceeds from the sale of
available-for-sale securities, an increase of $32.9 million
of investments in venture capital partnership and equity
investments, an increase of $29.3 million of purchases of
technology, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from
sales of short-term investments of $403.3 million, a
reduction in purchases of property, plant and equipment of
$42.3 million, a reduction of purchases of
available-for-sale securities of $10.1 million and a
reduction of purchases of software licenses of $4.5 million.

Cash flows from financing activities

2004 compared to

Net cash used for financing activities was $21.1 million in
2004, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities
of $149.2 million in 2003, a change of $162.5 million.
In 2004, our primary use of cash from financing activities was
the repurchase of $94.1 million of treasury stock, as
compared to $213.8 million in 2003. As of January 1,
2005, the remaining repurchase authorization under our stock
repurchase program totaled $123.0 million. Our primary
source of cash from financing activities was $75.3 million
from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options
and employee stock purchase program, as compared to
$86.6 million in 2003. In addition during 2003, we issued
$420.0 million of convertible notes and received proceeds
from the sale of common stock warrants and purchased convertible
notes hedges for $134.6 million.

2003 compared to

Net cash provided by financing activities increased by
$203.3 million from 2002 due to the issuance of our
convertibles notes and sale of common stock warrants noted
above, partially offset by an increase of $32.0 million in
the purchase of treasury stock.

We expect to continue our financing activity and may use cash
reserves to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program.
We may also consider additional hedging transactions if
opportunities become available.

Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital
Resources

We provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of our
foreign subsidiaries unless these earnings are considered
indefinitely invested outside of the United States. As of
January 1, 2005, it is our intention to continue to
indefinitely reinvest our undistributed foreign earnings.



On October 22, 2004, the AJCA was signed into law. A key
provision of the AJCA is a one-time incentive to repatriate
foreign earnings at a reduced effective tax rate. A company must
meet several requirements to qualify for the incentive and we
are currently studying the impact of the AJCA’s
repatriation provisions on our plans to indefinitely reinvest
our foreign earnings. If we determine that we will dividend all
or a portion of our undistributed foreign earnings, we will
potentially incur additional foreign and U.S. federal,
state and local income taxes in the period the dividend is made.
As of January 1, 2005, the cumulative amount of earnings
for which we have not provided a U.S. income tax accrual
was approximately $575.0 million. The maximum dividend that
may qualify for special treatment under the AJCA is the lower of
approximately $550.0 million and the amount of our foreign
earnings and profits at the time the dividend is made to one of
our U.S. companies.

We received an RAR from the IRS in which the IRS proposes to
assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the tax years 1997
through 1999 of approximately $143.0 million, plus
interest, which interest will accrue until the matter is
resolved. The RAR is not a final Statutory Notice of Deficiency,
and we have filed a protest with the IRS to certain of the
proposed adjustments. We are challenging these proposed
adjustments vigorously. The IRS may also make similar claims for
tax returns filed for years subsequent to 1999. While we are
protesting certain of the proposed adjustments, we cannot
predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of the tax
examination, including the amount payable, or timing of such
payments, which may materially impact our cash flows in the
period or periods resolved.

We expect to incur an additional $4.0 million to
$6.0 million of future costs in connection with our
restructuring activities, primarily for facilities-related
charges connected with the 2004 Restructuring, which amounts
will be expensed as incurred. We expect annualized cost
reductions resulting from the 2004 Restructuring of
approximately $20.0 million in employee salary and benefits
costs, related to employee terminations under the restructuring
plan.

During 2005, we plan to continue optimizing our operations. In
the first quarter of 2005, we announced a plan of restructuring
that will reduce our workforce by approximately 200 employees.
This will result in an estimated restructuring and other expense
of approximately $18.0 million to $20.0 million in
2005, which will result in cash payments of approximately
$15.0 million to $17.0 million in 2005. We expect
ongoing annual savings of approximately $30.0 million
related to this plan of restructuring.

In August 2003, we issued $420.0 million principal amount
of Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes due 2023 to
two initial purchasers in a private offering for resale to
qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A.
We received net proceeds of approximately $406.4 million,
after transaction fees of approximately $13.6 million that
were recorded in Other assets and are being amortized to
interest expense using the straight-line method over five years,
which is the duration of the first redemption period. We issued
the Notes at par and the Notes bear no interest. The Notes are
convertible into our common stock initially at a conversion
price of $15.65 per share, which would result in an
aggregate of 26.8 million shares issued upon conversion,
subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events.
We may redeem for cash all or any part of the Notes on or after
August 15, 2008 for 100.00% of the principal amount. The
holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion
of their Notes on August 15, 2008 for 100.25% of the
principal amount, on August 15, 2013 for 100.00% of the
principal amount or on August 15, 2018 for 100.00% of the
principal amount. The Notes do not contain any restrictive
financial covenants.

Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into
convertible notes hedge transactions whereby we have options to
purchase up to 26.8 million shares of our common stock at a
price of $15.65 per share. These options expire on
August 15, 2008 and must be settled in net shares. The cost
of the convertible notes hedge transactions to us was
approximately $134.6 million.

In addition, we sold warrants to purchase up to
26.8 million shares of our common stock at a price of
$23.08 per share. The warrants expire on various dates from
February 2008 through May 2008 and must be settled in net
shares. We received approximately $56.4 million in cash
proceeds for the sales of these warrants.



In 2005, we expect to pay between $315.0 million to
$335.0 million in cash payments to stockholders and
acquisition costs to acquire Verisity Ltd. as more fully
described in Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements.

A summary of our contractual obligations as of January 1,
2005 follows:

The primary components of Other long-term obligations of
$233.5 million related to indemnity holdbacks from
acquisitions, contingent purchase price payments relating to
acquisitions and deferred tax liabilities.

In connection with our acquisitions completed prior to
January 1, 2005, we may be obligated to pay up to an
aggregate of $47.0 million in cash during the next
12 months and an additional $36.0 million in cash
during the three years following the next 12 months if
certain performance goals related to one or more of the
following are achieved in full: revenue, bookings, product
proliferation, product development and employee retention.

We expect that current cash and short-term investment balances
and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our
working capital and other capital requirements for at least the
next 12 months.

New Accounting Standards

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R,
“Share-Based Payment, an amendment of FASB Statements
Nos. 123 and 95,” which requires the measurement of
all employee share-based payments to employees, including grants
of employee stock options, using a fair-value-based method and
the recording of such expense in our Consolidated Statements of
Operations. The accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123R
are effective for reporting periods beginning after
June 15, 2005. We are required to adopt
SFAS No. 123R in our third quarter of fiscal 2005. See
“Stock-Based Incentive Compensation” of Note 2 to
our Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net
income (loss) and net income (loss) per share amounts, for 2004,
2003 and 2002, as if we had used a fair-value-based method
similar to the methods required under SFAS No. 123R to
measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive
awards. Although we have not yet determined whether the adoption
of SFAS No. 123R will result in future amounts that
are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under
SFAS No. 123, we are evaluating the requirements under
SFAS No. 123R and expect the adoption to decrease our
net income during 2005 by approximately $25.0 million to
$40.0 million. This estimated range was calculated using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, based on currently
available option information. Our actual SFAS 123R
compensation expense for fiscal 2005 could differ from this
range, due to a difference in expense resulting from utilizing a
lattice valuation model instead of the Black-Scholes model and
equity grants at different levels than expected.

In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
No. FAS 109-1, “Application of FASB Statement
No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” to the
Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.” The AJCA provides for
a special 9% tax deduction on qualified production activities.
FAS 109-1 clarifies that this tax deduction should be
accounted for as a special tax deduction and not as a tax rate
reduction in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
“Accounting for Income



Taxes.” The adoption of FAS 109-1 did have a material
impact on our consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
No. FAS 109-2, “Accounting and Disclosure
Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within
the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.” The AJCA was
enacted on October 22, 2004 and created a temporary
incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated
earnings of foreign subsidiaries by providing an 85% dividends
received deduction for certain qualifying dividends. The
deduction is subject to a number of limitations. We may elect to
apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations during
fiscal 2005. FAS 109-2 provides guidance under
SFAS No. 109 with respect to recording the potential
impact of repatriation provisions of the AJCA on an
enterprise’s income tax expense and deferred tax liability.
FAS 109-2 states that an enterprise is allowed
additional time beyond the financial reporting period of
enactment to evaluate the effect of the AJCA on its plan for
reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of
applying SFAS No. 109. We are currently evaluating the
merits of repatriating funds under the AJCA and expect to
complete our evaluation of the effects of the repatriation
provision by October 1, 2005. The range of possible amounts
that we are considering for repatriation under this provision is
between zero and $550.0 million. We have historically
considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to
be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, we have not
provided for income taxes on these undistributed earnings. If we
decide to repatriate foreign earnings in a future period, we
will be required to recognize income tax expense related to the
federal, state, local and foreign income taxes that we would
incur on the repatriated earnings when the decision is made. We
are currently unable to reasonably estimate the possible range
of income tax effects of such repatriation.

In March 2004, the FASB issued EITF No. 03-1, “The
Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application
to Certain Investments” which provided new guidance for
assessing impairment losses on investments. Additionally, EITF
No. 03-1 includes new disclosure requirements for
investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired. In
September 2004, the FASB delayed the accounting provisions of
EITF No. 03-1; however the disclosure requirements remain
effective for annual periods ending after June 15, 2004. We
have adopted the disclosure requirements and will evaluate the
measurement requirements of EITF No. 03-1 once final
guidance is issued.

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We carried out an evaluation required by Rule 13a-15 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange
Act, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including the Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and
the Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Exchange Act) as of January  1, 2005.

The evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures
included a review of our processes and implementation and the
effect on the information generated for use in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K. In the course of this evaluation, we
sought to identify any significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures, to
determine whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving
personnel who have a significant role in our disclosure controls
and procedures, and to confirm that any necessary corrective
action, including process improvements, was taken. This type of
evaluation is done every fiscal quarter so that our conclusions
concerning the effectiveness of these controls can be reported
in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. The overall goals of
these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure
controls and procedures and to make modifications as necessary.
We intend to maintain these disclosure controls and procedures,
modifying them as circumstances warrant.

Based on their evaluation as of January 1, 2005, our CEO
and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were sufficiently effective to ensure that the
information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed
or submitted under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including the
CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.



Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the quarter ended January 1, 2005 that
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that
our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control
over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and
all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be
considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and
instances of fraud, if any, within Cadence have been detected.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended). Our management assessed the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting as of
January 1, 2005. In making this assessment, our management
used the criteria established in

Internal Control-Integrated
Framework

issued by The Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Our management has
concluded that, as of January 1, 2005, our internal control
over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has
issued an audit report on our assessment of our internal control
over financial reporting, which is included herein.

Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Cadence Design Systems, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity
and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended January 1, 2005. In
connection with our audits of the consolidated financial
statements, we also have audited the accompanying financial
statement schedule. These consolidated financial statements and
related schedule are the responsibility of the management of
Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements and related
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended January 1, 2005, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. as of January 1, 2005,
based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO), and our report dated March 14, 2005 expressed an
unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of, and the
effective operation of, internal control over financial
reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Cadence Design Systems, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A,

that
Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (the Company) maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of January 1,
2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Cadence Design
Systems, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of January 1, 2005, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established
in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. Also, in our opinion, Cadence Design
Systems, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of January 1,
2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
COSO

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of January 1, 2005 and January 3,
2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
January 1, 2005, and our report dated March 14, 2005
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements and the related financial statement schedule.

NOTE 1.

CADENCE

Cadence Design Systems, Inc., or Cadence, licenses electronic
design automation, or EDA, software, sells or leases hardware
technology and intellectual property and provides design and
methodology services throughout the world to help manage and
accelerate electronic product development processes.
Cadence’s broad range of products and services are used by
electronics companies to design and develop complex integrated
circuits, or ICs, and personal and commercial electronic systems.

In Cadence’s 2003 Annual Report, Cadence restated its
Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the fiscal year
ended December 28, 2002. The accompanying Consolidated
Financial Statements present restated results for the year ended
December 28, 2002. For the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
December 28, 2002 to be properly stated, Cadence recorded
the cumulative effect of adjustments for all years prior to
fiscal 2002 of $11.9 million to opening retained earnings
for fiscal 2002.

NOTE 2.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of
Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

Cadence’s fiscal year end is the Saturday closest to
December 31. Fiscal 2004 was a 52-week year. Fiscal 2003
and 2002 were 53-week and 52-week years, respectively. Fiscal
2005 will be a 52-week year ending December 31, 2005.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Cadence and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany
accounts and transactions.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Cash, Cash Equivalents
and Short-Term Investments

Cadence considers all highly liquid debt instruments which could
include commercial paper, euro time deposits, repurchase
agreements and certificates of deposit with remaining maturities
of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash
equivalents. Investments with maturities greater than three
months and less than one year are classified as short-term
investments.

Foreign Currency
Translation

Cadence transacts business in various foreign currencies. In
general, the functional currency of a foreign operation is the
local country’s currency except for Cadence’s
principal Irish, Hungarian and Dutch subsidiaries, whose
functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Non-functional
currency monetary balances are re-measured into the functional
currency of the subsidiary with any related gain or loss
recorded in Other expense, net in the accompanying Consolidated
Statements of Operations. Assets and liabilities of operations
outside the United States, for which the functional currency is
the local currency, are translated into U.S. dollars using
fiscal year-end exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are
translated at the average exchange rates in effect during each
fiscal month during the year. The effects of foreign currency
translation adjustments are included in Stockholders’
Equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income
in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

January 1, 2005

Derivative Financial
Instruments

Cadence accounts for its foreign currency exchange contracts in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or
SFAS, No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities.” Cadence enters into foreign
currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions
to protect against currency exchange risks associated with
existing assets and liabilities. A foreign currency forward
exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when
underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities
increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract
decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or
underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in
foreign exchange rates. The forward contracts are not designated
as accounting hedges under SFAS No. 133 and,
therefore, the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in
Other expense, net, in advance of the actual foreign currency
cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being
recorded as accrued liabilities.

Cadence does not use forward contracts for trading purposes.
Cadence’s forward contracts generally have maturities of
180 days or less. Recognized gains or losses with respect
to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how
accurately Cadence is able to match the amount of currency
forward exchange contracts with underlying asset and liability
exposures.

Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts

Cadence makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding
receivables and provide allowances for the portion of
receivables when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are
made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding
invoices and are recorded in operating expenses. For those
invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are made based on
Cadence’s historical bad debt experience. In determining
these percentages, Cadence analyzes its historical collection
experience and current economic trends. If the historical data
Cadence uses to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful
accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect
outstanding receivables, additional provisions may be needed
which could cause future results of operations to be materially
affected.

Allowance for Sales
Returns

Provisions for sales returns primarily relate to service
arrangements and are recorded as a reduction to revenue. These
provisions are made based on historical experience and changes
in customer preferences.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (using the first-in,
first-out method) or market value. Cadence’s inventories
include high technology parts and components for complex
computer systems that emulate the performance and operation of
computer IC and electronic systems. These parts and components
may be specialized in nature or subject to rapid technological
obsolescence. While Cadence has programs to minimize the
required inventories on hand and considers technological
obsolescence when estimating required reserves to reduce
recorded amounts to market values, it is reasonably possible
that such estimates could change in the near term.
Cadence’s practice is to reserve for inventory in excess of
12-month demand.

In the years ended January 1, 2005 and January 3,
2004, Cadence recorded no write-off for excess inventory. In the
year ended December 28, 2002, Cadence recorded a
$9.3 million write-off for excess inventory included in
Cost of product due to decreased sales forecasts for emulation
products.



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

January 1, 2005

Property, Plant and
Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost.
Depreciation and amortization are generally provided over the
estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, as
follows:

Computer equipment and related software

3-8 years

Buildings

10-32 years

Leasehold and building improvements

Shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life

Furniture and fixtures

3-5 years

Equipment

3-5 years

Cadence capitalizes the costs of software developed for internal
use in compliance with Statement of Position, or SOP, 98-1
“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
Obtained for Internal Use” and with Emerging Issues Task
Force, or EITF, Issue 00-2 “Accounting for Web Site
Development Costs.” Capitalization of software developed
for internal use and web site development costs begins at the
application development phase of the project. Cadence
capitalized $21.4 million in 2004, $21.0 million in
2003, and $48.1 million in 2002. Capitalized costs related
to purchased software, internal development and other consulting
services from third parties for software that is used, or
intended to be used, internally. Amortization of software
developed for internal use and web site development costs begins
when the computer software is ready for its intended use, and is
computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life
of the product.

Cadence recorded depreciation and amortization expense in the
amount of $68.7 million for 2004, $81.9 million for
2003 and $100.1 million for 2002 for property, plant and
equipment.

Software Development
Costs

Cadence accounts for software development costs in accordance
with SFAS No. 86, “Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise
Marketed.” Software development costs are capitalized
beginning when a product’s technological feasibility has
been established by completion of a working model of the product
and amortization begins when a product is available for general
release to customers. The period between the achievement of
technological feasibility and the general release of
Cadence’s products has typically been of short duration.
Internally-generated software development costs have not been
material.

Cadence capitalized $10.3 million of purchased software
during 2004, of which $4.2 million was paid and of which
$6.1 million was accrued as of January  1, 2005.
Cadence capitalized $4.3 million of purchased software
during 2003. Cadence has deemed the purchased software to have
an alternative future use in accordance with
SFAS No. 86. Therefore, Cadence begins amortization of
purchased software when the technology is available for general
release to customers. Amortization expense related to purchased
software was $2.2 million during 2004, $0.5 million
during 2003 and $1.9 million during 2002. In addition,
Cadence reported an impairment charge of $10.2 million in
2002 in connection with purchased software included in
Restructuring and other charges in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations.

Acquired Intangibles,
including Goodwill

Acquired intangibles, which include purchased technology and
other intangible assets, are stated at cost less accumulated
amortization and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. In
accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets,” goodwill and purchased intangibles with
indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed for
impairment at least annually or when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that Cadence will not be able to recover
the asset’s carrying amount. Acquired intangibles with
definite lives are amortized on a

straight-line basis over the remaining estimated economic life
of the underlying products and technologies (original lives
assigned are one to ten years).

During the third quarters of 2004, 2003 and 2002, Cadence
completed its annual impairment analysis of goodwill. Based on
the results of these impairment reviews, Cadence has determined
that no indicators of impairment existed for its two reporting
units in 2004 and three reporting units in 2003 and 2002 and,
accordingly, no impairment charge was recognized during 2004,
2003 or 2002.

Long-lived Assets

Cadence’s long-lived assets consist of property, plant and
equipment and other acquired intangibles, excluding goodwill.
Cadence reviews its long-lived assets for impairment in
accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” For assets to
be held and used, Cadence initiates its review whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an
asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the
expected future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is
expected to generate. If it is determined that an asset is not
recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded in the amount by
which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.
Cadence abandoned certain assets and recorded a charge of
$9.4 million on long-lived assets during 2004, which charge
is included in Restructuring and other charges in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. No
impairments were recorded for long-lived assets during 2003 or
2002.

Assets to be disposed of and for which management has committed
to a plan to dispose of the assets, whether through sale or
abandonment, are reported at the lower of carrying amount or
fair value less cost to sell. Management has no assets that were
deemed held for sale as of January 1, 2005 and
January 3, 2004.

Marketable and
Non-Marketable Securities

Marketable Securities

Management considers all of its investments in marketable
securities as available-for-sale. Marketable securities are
stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses
presented net of tax and reported as a separate component of
stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses are
determined using the specific identification method. Gains are
recognized when realized and are recorded in our Consolidated
Statement of Operations as Other expense, net. Losses are
recognized as realized or when Cadence has determined that an
other-than-temporary decline in fair value has occurred.

It is Cadence’s policy to review the fair value of these
marketable securities on a regular basis to determine whether
its investments in these companies are other-than-temporarily
impaired. This evaluation includes, but is not limited to,
reviewing each company’s cash position, financing needs,
earnings or revenue outlook, operational performance, management
or ownership changes and competition. If Cadence believes the
carrying value of an investment is in excess of its fair value,
and this difference is other-than-temporary, it is
Cadence’s policy to write down the investment to reduce its
carrying value to fair value.

Non-Marketable
Securities

Cadence’s non-marketable securities include investments in
privately-held companies that Cadence makes either directly, or
indirectly through venture capital limited partnerships. Cadence
owns limited partnership interests in three venture capital
limited partnerships, Telos Venture Partners, L.P., or
Telos I, Telos Venture Partners II, L.P., or
Telos II, and Telos Venture Partners III, L.P., or
Telos III (referred to together as Telos).

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

January 1, 2005

Cadence and certain of its deferred compensation trusts are the
sole limited partners of Telos I and Telos III and Cadence
is the sole limited partner of Telos II. The partnership
agreements governing Telos I, Telos II and
Telos III, which are substantially the same, require
Cadence to meet capital calls principally for the purpose of
funding investments that are recommended by the applicable Telos
general partner, and approved by the Telos advisory committee as
being consistent with the partnership’s limitations and
stated purposes. The Telos general partner, which is not
affiliated with Cadence, manages the partnerships and may be
removed by Cadence without cause. For all partnerships, the
advisory committee is comprised solely of Cadence’s
Chairman of the Board of Directors and two other members of
Cadence’s Board of Directors.

As of January 1, 2005, Cadence had contributed
$96.3 million to these Telos partnerships and is
contractually committed to contribute to these partnerships up
to an additional $69.1 million. Actual future contributions
will depend upon the level of investments made by Telos.
Cadence’s commitments expire concurrently with the
termination date of each partnership, which, in the case of
Telos I, is December 31, 2005, in the case of
Telos II, is July 3, 2012, and, in the case of
Telos III, is June 1, 2012. The investments in the
Telos partnerships are recorded in Other assets in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The investments made by Telos and directly by Cadence are
accounted for using either the cost or equity method of
accounting. Cadence accounts for investments made by Telos as if
Cadence had directly made the investment and, accordingly, all
investments recorded on the equity method of accounting are
adjusted to reflect Cadence’s share of the investee’s
income (loss).

Cadence’s non-marketable securities held by Telos, or by
Cadence directly, are not publicly-traded or contain trading
restrictions. To determine the fair value of publicly-traded
securities with trading restrictions, Cadence uses the fair
value, which considers the current market price of the security
and the specific characteristics of the restrictions. To
determine the fair value of privately-held investments, Cadence
uses the most recent round of financing or estimates of current
fair value using traditional valuation techniques. It is
Cadence’s policy to review the fair value of these
investments held by Telos, as well as its direct investments, on
a regular basis to determine whether the investments in these
companies are other-than-temporarily impaired. This evaluation
includes, but is not limited to, reviewing each company’s
cash position, financing needs, earnings or revenue outlook,
operational performance, management or ownership changes and
competition. In the case of privately-held companies, this
evaluation is based on information that Cadence requests from
these companies. This information is not subject to the same
disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly-traded companies
and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the
timing and the accuracy of the data received from these
companies. If Cadence believes the carrying value of an
investment is in excess of fair value, and this difference is
other-than-temporary, it is Cadence’s policy to write down
the investment to fair value.

Effective October 2, 2004, the beginning of Cadence’s
fourth quarter, and upon the adoption of EITF No. 02-14,
“Whether an Investor Should Apply the Equity Method of
Accounting to Investments Other Than Common Stock,” if
Cadence determined that it had the ability to exercise
significant influence over the investee and the investment was
in the form of in-substance common stock, the investment was
accounted for under the equity method. For certain investments
previously accounted for under the equity method, Cadence
determined that these investments were not in-substance common
stock because of the remaining value attributable to the common
shareholders.

Equity Method
Investments

Cadence applies the guidance in Accounting Principles Board
Opinion, or APB, No. 18, “The Equity Method of
Accounting for Investments in Common Stock,” as amended, to
classify investments as equity method investments. These
investments are held in the form of voting preferred stock or
convertible debt of

January 1, 2005

privately-held companies. Prior to October 2, 2004, if
Cadence determined that it had the ability to exercise
significant influence over the investee, the investment was
accounted for under the equity method.

In applying the equity method of accounting, Cadence applies
approach (a) of EITF No. 99-10, “Percentage Used
to Determine the Amount of Equity Method Losses.”
Accordingly, the portion of equity method loss or income
recorded by Cadence is based on its percentage ownership of each
investee’s preferred stock or convertible debt available to
absorb losses or with contractual rights to income. Its level of
participation in future financings of its equity method
investees may impact Cadence’s proportional share in future
income or losses. Cadence records its interest in equity method
gains and losses in the quarter following incurrence because it
is not practicable to obtain investee financial statements prior
to the issuance of Cadence’s Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Cost Method
Investments

Investments accounted for by Cadence under the cost method of
accounting are carried at historical cost and Cadence
periodically evaluates the fair value of each investment to
determine if an other-than-temporary decline in value has
occurred.

Deferred Revenue

Deferred revenue arises when customers are billed for products
and/or services in advance of delivery and completion of the
earnings process. Cadence’s deferred revenue consists
primarily of unearned revenue on maintenance and product
licenses for which revenue is recognized in installments over
the duration of the license. Maintenance on perpetual licenses
is generally renewed annually, billed in full in advance, and
earned over the ensuing 12-month maintenance term. Product
licenses recognized as revenue over multiple periods and
maintenance on term licenses are generally billed quarterly in
advance and earned over multiple periods over the ensuing
license period. Cadence excludes from deferred revenue and
accounts receivable any amounts billed prior to the beginning of
the term of the license.

Stock-Based
Compensation

As of January 1, 2005, Cadence had four stock-based
employee compensation plans (excluding director plans). Cadence
accounts for these plans under the recognition and measurement
principles of APB No. 25 “Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees,” and related interpretations. Under APB
Opinion No. 25, compensation expense is recognized if an
option’s exercise price on the measurement date is below
the fair value of the company’s common stock. The
compensation, if any, is amortized to expense over the vesting
period.

The table below provides a pro forma illustration of the
financial results of operations as if Cadence had accounted for
its grants of employee stock options under the fair value method
of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock–Based
Compensation.” The impact of employee stock options on the
pro forma financial results of operations was estimated at the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Cadence used expected volatility, as well as other economic
data, to estimate the volatility for the option grants during
2004 and 2003 because management believes the amount yielded by
this method is representative of prospective trends. To
determine expected volatility, Cadence considered implied
volatility in market-traded options on its common stock as well
as third party volatility quotes. In 2002, Cadence used
historical trading volatility. Cadence determined the estimated
fair values of its options granted and shares purchased under
its employee

stock-based compensation:

For fixed awards, as defined by APB No. 25, Cadence
amortizes deferred stock compensation to expense using the
straight-line method over the period that the stock options and
restricted stock vest, which is generally three to four years.
For variable awards, as defined by ABP No. 25, stock-based
compensation expense is recognized on an accelerated basis in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB,
Interpretation No. 28, “Accounting for Stock
Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award
Plans.”

Comprehensive Income

Other comprehensive income includes foreign currency translation
gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses on marketable
securities that are available-for-sale that have been excluded
from net income (loss) and reflected instead in
stockholders’ equity. Cadence has reported the components
of comprehensive income on its Consolidated Statements of
Stockholders’ Equity. Cadence reclassified
$6.8 million in 2004, net of $2.7 million of tax, $0
in 2003 and $9.2 million in 2002, net of $3.7 million
of tax, from unrealized holding gains and losses on marketable
securities to realized gains included in Other expense, net in
the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The tax
expense (benefit) for gross unrealized holding gains (losses) in
marketable equity securities was $(16.4) million in 2004,
$3.8 million in 2003 and $(0.3) million in 2002.

Revenue Recognition

Cadence classifies revenue by the three sources from which it is
earned: Product; Maintenance; and Services. Product revenue
includes fees associated with the licensing of Cadence’s
software and sale or lease of its hardware products. Maintenance
revenue includes fees associated with providing technical
support for Cadence’s products. Services revenue includes
fees received for performing methodology and design services.

Cadence applies the provisions of SOP 97-2, “Software
Revenue Recognition,” as amended by SOP 98-9,
“Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions,” to all
product revenue transactions where the software is not
incidental. Cadence also applies the provisions of
SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases,” to all
hardware lease transactions. While these statements govern the
basis for revenue recognition, Cadence exercises significant
judgment and uses estimates in connection with the determination
of the amount of product, service and maintenance revenue and
deferred revenue to be recognized in each accounting period.
Material differences may result in the amount and timing of
Cadence’s revenue for any period if its management made
different judgments or utilized different estimates.

Product Revenue

The timing of product revenue recognition will differ depending
on the license types and the individual terms and conditions
associated with each particular license agreement. Cadence
licenses software using three different license types:

•

Subscription licenses — software licensed for a
    specific time period, generally two to three years, with no
    contractual rights to return and limited rights to remix within
    the licensed software and to unspecified future technology. In
    general, revenue associated with subscription licenses is
    recognized over the term of the license commencing upon the
    effective date of the license and initial delivery of the
    licensed product.

•

Term licenses — software licensed for a specific time
    period, generally two to three years, with no contractual rights
    to return and, generally, limited rights to remix within the
    licensed software but no right to remix the licensed software
    for unspecified future technology. In general, revenue
    associated with term licenses is recognized upon the effective
    date of the license and when other revenue recognition criteria
    have been met.

•

Perpetual licenses — software licensed on a perpetual
    basis with no contractual right to return, exchange or remix the
    licensed software. In general, revenue associated with perpetual
    licenses is recognized upon the effective date of the license
    and when other revenue recognition criteria have been met.

Occasionally, customers may request and Cadence may agree to
modify the terms of an existing arrangement for which revenue is
being recognized over multiple periods. The modifications to the



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

January 1, 2005

arrangement may include changes in access to technology, payment
terms or other license terms. In these situations, Cadence
accounts for the modified arrangement as a new transaction if
the modification to the arrangement includes substantive changes
to the existing license terms.

Maintenance
Revenue

Maintenance revenue consists of fees for providing technical
support and software updates on a when-and-if available basis.
Cadence recognizes all maintenance revenue over multiple periods
over the maintenance term under each software license agreement.
For subscription licenses, Cadence allocates a portion of the
revenue to maintenance revenue based on the estimated fair value
of the maintenance. The estimated fair value of maintenance is
based upon pricing when maintenance is sold separately.

Finance Fee
Revenue

Finance fees result from discounting to present value the
product revenue derived from Cadence’s installment
contracts in which the payment terms extend beyond one year from
the contract effective date. Finance fees are recognized ratably
over the relevant license term and are classified as product
revenue. Finance fee revenue represented 2% of total revenue for
2004, 1% of total revenue for 2003 and 1% of total revenue for
2002.

Services
Revenue

Services revenue consists primarily of revenue received for
performing methodology and design services. These services are
not related to the functionality of Cadence’s software
licenses. Revenue from service contracts is recognized either on
the time and materials method, as work is performed, or on the
percentage-of-completion method. For contracts with fixed or
not-to-exceed fees, Cadence estimates on a monthly basis the
percentage-of-completion, which is based on the completion of
milestones relating to the arrangement. Cadence has a history of
accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to
complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can
affect Cadence’s estimates, including labor rates,
utilization and efficiency variances and specification and
testing requirement changes. If different conditions were to
prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made, then the
use of the completed contract method would be required and the
recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the
project was completed. This change could have a material impact
on Cadence’s results of operations.

Revenue
Recognition Criteria

Cadence recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the fee is
fixed or determinable, collection of the resulting receivable is
probable, and vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value,
or VSOE, exists.

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement

— For
subscription and term licenses and hardware leases, Cadence uses
the signed contract as evidence of an arrangement. For perpetual
licenses, hardware sales, maintenance renewals and small
fixed-price service projects, such as training classes and
small, standard methodology service engagements of approximately
$10,000 or less, Cadence uses a purchase order as evidence of an
arrangement. For all other service engagements, Cadence uses a
signed professional services agreement and a statement of work
to evidence an arrangement. Sales through Cadence’s
distributors are evidenced by master agreements governing the
relationship, together with binding purchase orders from the
distributor on a transaction-by-transaction basis.

Product delivery

— Software and the
corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers
electronically. Electronic delivery occurs when Cadence provides
the customer access to the software. Occasionally, Cadence will
deliver the software on a compact disc with standard transfer
terms of free-on-

board shipping point. Cadence’s software license agreements
generally do not contain acceptance provisions. With respect to
hardware, delivery of an entire system is deemed to occur upon
completion of installation.

Fee is fixed or determinable

— Cadence assesses
whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the
arrangement, primarily based on the payment terms associated
with the transaction. Cadence uses installment contracts that
extend up to a maximum of five years from the contract date for
certain term and subscription licenses and Cadence has
established a history of collecting under the original contract
without providing concessions on payments, products or services.
Cadence’s installment contracts that do not include a
substantial up front payment have payment periods that are equal
to or less than the term of the licenses and the payments are
collected quarterly in equal or nearly equal installments, when
evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement.

Significant judgment is involved in assessing whether a fee is
fixed or determinable, including assessing whether a contract
amendment constitutes a concession. Cadence’s experience
has been that Cadence is able to determine whether a fee is
fixed or determinable. While Cadence does not expect that
experience to change, if Cadence no longer had a history of
collecting under the original contract without providing
concessions on term licenses, revenue from term licenses would
be required to be recognized when payments under the installment
contract become due and payable. This change could have a
material impact on Cadence’s results of operations.

Collection is probable

— Cadence has concluded
that collection is not probable for license arrangements
executed with entities in certain countries. For all other
countries, Cadence assesses collectibility at the outset of the
arrangement based on a number of factors, including the
customer’s past payment history and its current
creditworthiness. If in Cadence’s judgment collection of a
fee is not probable, Cadence defers the revenue until the
uncertainty is removed, which generally means revenue is
recognized upon receipt of cash payment. Cadence’s
experience has been that Cadence is able to estimate whether
collection is probable. While Cadence does not expect that
experience to change, if Cadence were to determine that
collection is not probable for any license arrangement with
installment payment terms, revenue from such license would be
recognized generally upon the receipt of cash payment. This
change could have a material impact on Cadence’s results of
operations.

Vendor-Specific Objective Evidence of Fair
Value

— Cadence’s VSOE for certain product
elements of an arrangement is based upon the pricing in
comparable transactions when the element is sold separately.
VSOE for maintenance is generally based upon the customer’s
stated annual renewal rates. VSOE for services is generally
based on the price charged when the services are sold
separately. For multiple element arrangements, VSOE must exist
to allocate the total fee among all delivered and undelivered
elements in the arrangement. If VSOE does not exist for all
elements to support the allocation of the total fee among all
delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement, revenue
is deferred until such evidence does exist for the undelivered
elements, or until all elements are delivered, whichever is
earlier. If VSOE of all undelivered elements exists but VSOE
does not exist for one or more delivered elements, revenue is
recognized using the residual method. Under the residual method,
the VSOE of the undelivered elements is deferred, and the
remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as
revenue as elements are delivered. Cadence’s experience has
been that Cadence is able to estimate VSOE. While Cadence does
not expect that experience to change, if it could no longer
support VSOE for undelivered elements of multiple element
arrangements, revenue would be deferred until Cadence has VSOE
for the undelivered elements or all elements are delivered,
whichever is earlier. This change could have a material impact
on Cadence’s results of operations.

In September 2002, Cadence acquired IBM’s Test Design
Automation, or TDA, business. Concurrent with the acquisition,
Cadence licensed software to IBM and entered into an agreement
to provide services. In connection with these transactions,
Cadence considered SFAS No. 141, “Business
Combination,” and EITF No. 98-3,
“Determining Whether a Nonmonetary Transaction Involves
Receipt of Productive Assets of



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

January 1, 2005

a Business,” to determine whether the acquisition of the
TDA business qualified for accounting as a purchase business
combination. In addition, Cadence considered APB Opinion
No. 29, “Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions”
and EITF No. 01-02, “Interpretation of APB Opinion
No. 29” to determine whether the concurrent
transactions were appropriately recorded at their respective
fair values. In concluding that the fair values were reasonably
determinable, Cadence considered its recent history of cash
sales for similar products or services in similar sized
transactions with similar terms. Approximately 3% of revenue
recognized in 2002 resulted from this concurrent transaction.

In September 2003, Cadence entered into a license to use and
resell certain technology from IBM. During December 2003 and
January 2004, Cadence sold hardware and services and licensed
software to IBM. These transactions were separately negotiated,
settled in cash, recorded at terms Cadence considers to be
arms-length and were not deemed to be concurrent. Cadence
recognized revenue from these transactions with IBM totaling
approximately 4% of total revenue in 2003.

Sales of Installment
Contract Receivables

Cadence transfers installment contract receivables on a
non-recourse or limited-recourse basis to third party financing
institutions. These transfers are recorded as sales and
accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 140,
“Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
and Extinguishments of Liabilities.” Cadence transferred
accounts receivable totaling $30.1 million in 2004,
$87.4 million in 2003 and $182.0 million in 2002, to
financing institutions on a non-recourse basis. Cadence recorded
losses on the sale of receivables in Other expense, net, in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations of
$2.0 million in 2004, $5.0 million in 2003 and
$15.1 million in 2002. When Cadence sells receivables, it
retains the servicing rights to the underlying accounts
receivable. The fair value of the retained servicing rights has
not been material.

Accounting for Income
Taxes

Cadence uses the asset and liability method to account for
income taxes. Under this method, Cadence is required to estimate
its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it
operates. This process involves estimating actual current tax
liabilities together with assessing temporary differences
resulting from differing treatment of items, such as deferred
revenue, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences
result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date. Cadence
then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be
recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent it
believes that recovery is not likely, Cadence must establish a
valuation allowance. To the extent Cadence establishes a
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets or increases this
allowance in a period, Cadence may need to include an expense
within the tax provision in its Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

Significant management judgment is required in determining the
provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities
and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax
assets. The valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable
income for each jurisdiction in which Cadence operates and the
period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable. In
the event that actual results differ from these estimates or
Cadence adjusts these estimates in future periods, Cadence may
need to establish an additional valuation allowance, which could
materially affect its financial position and results of
operations.

Restructuring Charges

Cadence accounts for restructuring charges in accordance with
SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100,
“Restructuring and Impairment Charges.” Since 2001,
Cadence has undertaken significant restructuring initiatives.
The individual components of the restructuring activities
initiated prior to fiscal 2003 were accounted for in accordance
with EITF No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition for Certain
Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring),” and EITF No. 88-10, “Costs
Associated with Lease Modifications or Terminations.”

For restructuring activities initiated after fiscal 2002,
Cadence accounted for the facilities and asset-related portions
of these restructurings in accordance with
SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities.” The severance and
benefits charges were accounted for in accordance with
SFAS No. 112, “Employers’ Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits — An Amendment of FASB
Statements No. 5 and 43.”

These restructuring initiatives have required Cadence to make a
number of estimates and assumptions related to losses on excess
facilities vacated or consolidated, particularly the timing of
subleases and sublease terms. Closure and space reduction costs
included in the restructuring charges include payments required
under leases less any applicable estimated sublease income after
the facilities are abandoned, lease buyout costs and costs to
maintain facilities during the period after abandonment.

In addition, Cadence has recorded estimated provisions for
termination benefits and outplacement costs, long-term asset
impairments, and other restructuring costs. Cadence regularly
evaluates the adequacy of its restructuring accrual, and adjusts
the balance based on changes in estimates and assumptions.
Cadence may incur future charges for new restructuring
activities as well as for changes in estimates to amounts
previously recorded.

Concentrations of Credit
Risk

Financial instruments, including derivative financial
instruments, that may potentially subject Cadence to
concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash, cash
equivalents, short-term investments, long-term investments,
accounts receivable and forward contracts. Concentration of
credit risk related to accounts receivable is limited, due to
the varied customers comprising Cadence’s customer base and
their dispersion across geographical locations. Credit exposure
related to the forward contracts is limited to the realized and
unrealized gains on these contracts. Cadence issued options and
warrants to hedge potential dilution of its convertible notes,
as described more fully in Note 7. Changes in the fair
value of these convertible notes hedge and warrant transactions
will not be recognized as long as the instruments remain
classified in equity. All financial instruments are executed
with financial institutions with strong credit ratings, which
minimizes risk of loss due to nonpayment.

Fair Value of Financial
Instruments

The fair value of Cadence’s cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments, receivables, foreign currency forward
exchange contracts and accounts payable approximate their
carrying value due to the short-term nature of these
instruments. The fair market values of Cadence’s long-term
investments, convertible notes, capital lease obligations and
installment contract receivables approximate their carrying
values based upon current market rates of interest.

Reclassifications

Cadence reclassified auction rate securities of
$75.4 million as of January 3, 2004 from Cash and cash
equivalents to Short-term investments on its Consolidated
Balance Sheet. Cadence has reclassified the purchases and sales
of these auction rate securities in its Consolidated Statements

NOTE 4. ACQUISITIONS

For each of the acquisitions described below, the results of
operations and the estimated fair value of the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed have been included in Cadence’s
Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the
acquisition.

2004 Acquisitions

Neolinear, Inc.

In April 2004, Cadence acquired Neolinear, Inc., or Neolinear, a
privately-held developer of rapid analog design technology.
Cadence purchased Neolinear to acquire key personnel and
technology. As discussed in Note 6, prior to the
acquisition Cadence held an investment in Neolinear of
$3.0 million, representing 12% ownership, which was
accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In
accordance with SFAS No. 141, “Business
Combinations,” Cadence accounted for the acquisition of
Neolinear as a step acquisition. The aggregate initial purchase
price was $78.1 million, which included the payment of
cash, the fair value of assumed options and acquisition costs.
The purchase price and goodwill will increase if certain
performance goals related to revenue targets and product
development are achieved over a period of approximately four
years following the acquisition.

The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the
purchase price for Neolinear and the estimated amortization
period for the acquired intangibles:

The $38.3 million of goodwill is not expected to be
deductible for income tax purposes.

Other 2004
Acquisition

During the year ended January 1, 2005, Cadence acquired one
other company for an aggregate initial purchase price of
$9.2 million, which included the payment of cash, the fair
value of assumed options and acquisition costs. The
$5.9 million of goodwill recorded in connection with this
acquisition is not expected to be deductible for income tax
purposes.

Comparative pro forma financial information for all acquisitions
completed in fiscal 2004 have not been presented because their
effect on results of operations was not material to
Cadence’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Acquisition-Related Earnouts

For almost all of Cadence’s acquisitions, payment of a
portion of the purchase price is contingent upon the acquired
entity’s achievement of certain performance goals, which
relate to one or more of the following criteria: revenue,
bookings, product proliferation, product development, and
employee retention. The portion of the earnout associated with
employee retention is recorded as compensation expense. The
specific performance goal levels, and amounts and timing of
contingent purchase price payments, vary with each acquisition.

In the year ended January 1, 2005, Cadence recorded
$40.6 million of goodwill as contingent purchase price
payable to stockholders of acquired companies. The
$40.6 million of goodwill consisted of $17.0 million
of actual cash payments, $7.2 million of accrued cash
payments and the issuance of 1.1 million shares of
Cadence’s common stock valued at $16.4 million.

In connection with Cadence’s acquisitions completed prior
to January 1, 2005, Cadence may be obligated to pay up to
an aggregate of $47.0 million in cash during the next
12 months and an additional $36.0 million in cash
during the three years following the next 12 months if
certain performance goals related to one or more of the
following are achieved in full: revenue, bookings, product
proliferation, product development and employee retention.

2003 Acquisitions

Verplex Systems,
Inc.

In August 2003, Cadence acquired Verplex Systems, Inc., or
Verplex, a privately-held developer of verification technology.
Cadence purchased Verplex to acquire key personnel and
technology. The aggregate initial purchase price was
$87.6 million, which included the payment of cash, the fair
value of assumed options and acquisition costs. The purchase
price and goodwill will increase if certain performance goals
related to bookings and product development are achieved over a
period of approximately three years following the acquisition.

Distribution
Rights of Innotech Corporation

In June 2003, Cadence acquired distribution rights to certain
customers, certain assets and key personnel from Innotech
Corporation, or Innotech, a publicly-traded developer and
distributor of software, electronic devices and semiconductor
manufacturing equipment in Japan. Concurrent with this
acquisition, Cadence also modified its distributor agreement
with Innotech. Prior to the acquisition, Cadence licensed most
of its software products in Japan through Innotech, of which
Cadence was an approximately 15% stockholder as of
January 1, 2005. Cadence now directly licenses its software
products to customers for which Cadence acquired the
distribution rights from Innotech.

Cadence considered SFAS No. 141, “Business
Combinations,” and EITF No. 98-3, “Determining
Whether a Nonmonetary Transaction Involves Receipt of Productive
Assets or of a Business,” in concluding that a business was
acquired in this transaction. Cadence also determined that the
modification to the distributor arrangement and the agreement to
acquire a portion of Innotech’s business should be combined
for the purposes of determining the total initial purchase
price, as both of these agreements with Innotech were entered
into concurrently.

Get2Chip.com,
Inc.

In April 2003, Cadence acquired Get2Chip.com, Inc., or Get2Chip,
a privately-held developer of nanometer-scale synthesis
technology. Cadence purchased Get2Chip to acquire key personnel
and technology. The aggregate initial purchase price was
$80.5 million, which included the payment of cash, the fair
value of assumed options and acquisition costs. The purchase
price and goodwill will increase if certain performance goals
related to bookings are achieved over a period of approximately
three years following the acquisition.

Inc., or Celestry, a privately-held developer of silicon
modeling products and full-chip circuit simulation technology.
Cadence purchased

Celestry to acquire key personnel and technology. The aggregate
initial purchase price was $65.7 million, which included
the payment of cash, the fair value of assumed options and
acquisition costs. The purchase price and goodwill will increase
if certain performance goals related to bookings and product
development are achieved over a period of approximately two
years following the acquisition.

The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the
purchase price for Celestry and the estimated amortization
period for the acquired intangibles:

The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for income tax

Other 2003
Acquisitions

In the year ended January 3, 2004, Cadence also acquired
two other companies for an initial aggregate purchase price of
$18.9 million, which included the payment of cash and
acquisition costs. The purchase price and goodwill will increase
if certain performance goals related to revenue, product
proliferation, product development or employee retention are
achieved over a period of approximately three or four years
following the acquisition.

Goodwill of $9.6 million recorded in connection with these
acquisitions is not expected to be deductible for income tax
purposes.

Comparative pro forma financial information for acquisitions
completed in 2003 has not been presented because the results of
operations were not material to Cadence’s Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Acquisition-Related Earnouts

In the year ended January 3, 2004, Cadence recorded
$52.3 million of goodwill as contingent purchase price
payable to stockholders of acquired companies. The
$52.3 million of goodwill consisted of $2.4 million in
cash and the issuance of shares of Cadence’s common stock
valued at $49.9 million. The additional goodwill related to
the achievement of certain performance goals related to one or
more of the following criteria: revenue, bookings, product
proliferation, product development and employee retention. The
portion of the earnout associated with employee retention is
recorded as compensation expense. The goodwill is not expected
to be deductible for income tax purposes.

2002 Acquisitions

IBM TDA

In September 2002, Cadence acquired IBM’s Test Design
Automation, or TDA, business and paid a total cash purchase
price of approximately $70.0 million. Concurrent with the
acquisition, as described in Note 2, Cadence licensed
software to IBM under subscription and term licenses, and
entered into an agreement to provide hardware and services.
Payments for these arrangements are to be paid over the duration
of the respective contracts under Cadence’s standard
payment terms. Cash payments expected to be made by IBM for the
software licenses will be significantly in excess of the cash
paid by Cadence for the TDA business. The software licenses and
services transactions were determined to have fair value based
upon pricing for comparable transactions. Cadence purchased
IBM’s TDA business to acquire key technology and personnel.

The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase
price of the TDA business and the estimated amortization period
for the acquired intangibles:

For tax purposes, $19.9 million of the goodwill is expected
to be deductible.

Simplex Solutions,
Inc.

In June 2002, Cadence acquired 100% of the outstanding common
stock of Simplex Solutions, Inc., or Simplex, a publicly-traded
company that provides software and services for the design and
verification of ICs. The aggregate purchase price was
$329.7 million, which included the issuance of
approximately 14.6 million shares of Cadence common stock,
valued at $267.3 million, 4.5 million shares of
Cadence common stock issuable on the exercise of assumed
options, with a fair value of $46.4 million, and
acquisition costs of $16.0 million. The value of the common
stock issued was determined based on the average market price of
Cadence’s common stock for the five day trading period
including two trading days before and after June 3, 2002 as
a result of a pricing collar in the merger agreement. The collar
provided that if the 10-day average of Cadence’s common
stock as of the second trading day prior to Simplex’s
stockholders’ meeting fell below $19.47, then, for purposes
of the exchange ratio, the Cadence stock price would be fixed at
such threshold amount. June 3, 2002 was the first day on
which the 10-day average fell below the threshold, which average
continued to decline until Simplex’s stockholders’
meeting, and thus was the date the number of shares of Cadence
common stock to be issued in the merger became fixed. Cadence
purchased Simplex to acquire key personnel and technology.

Other 2002
Acquisitions

In the year ended December 28, 2002, Cadence also acquired:
(i) four companies; (ii) substantially all of the
assets of one company; and (iii) the assets of one division
of another company. The initial aggregate purchase price for
these acquisitions was $61.6 million, of which
$33.5 million was cash and the remainder related to the
issuance of shares of Cadence common stock with a fair value of
$28.1 million.

Goodwill recognized in these transactions was
$39.3 million. Of the total goodwill, $8.5 million is
expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

Comparative pro forma financial information for all 2002
acquisitions has not been presented because the results of
operations were not material to Cadence’s Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Acquisition-Related Earnouts

In the year ended December 28, 2002, Cadence recorded
$181.2 million of goodwill as contingent purchase price
payable to stockholders of acquired companies. The
$181.2 million of goodwill consisted of the fair value of
issued shares of Cadence’s common stock. The additional
goodwill related to the achievement of certain performance goals
related to one or more of the following criteria: revenue,
bookings, product proliferation, product development and
employee retention. The portion of the earnout associated with
employee retention is recorded as compensation expense. The
goodwill is not expected to be deductible for income tax
purposes.

Write-off of Acquired
In-Process Research and Development

Acquired in-process research and development charges represent
in-process research and development that had not reached
technological feasibility at the time of acquisition and had no
probable alternative future use.

For acquisitions completed during 2004, 2003 and 2002 the
purchase price allocated to acquired in-process research and
development was determined through established valuation
techniques. The acquired in-process research and development was
immediately expensed because technological feasibility had not
been established, and no future alternative use exists. The
write-off of acquired in-process research and development is a
component of operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations.

Described below are the write-offs of acquired in-process
research and development charges in 2004, 2003 and 2002.

NOTE 5. GOODWILL AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES

Goodwill

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets,” Cadence conducts an annual
impairment analysis of goodwill, which it completed during the
third quarter of 2004. Based on the results of the impairment
review, Cadence has determined that no indicators of impairment
existed for any of its reporting units during 2004. Accordingly,
no impairment charge has been recognized.

Cadence’s annual impairment review process compares the
fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value,
including the goodwill related to the reporting unit. To
determine the reporting unit’s fair value, Cadence utilizes
a combination of the income and market valuation approaches.

The income approach provides an estimate of fair value based on
the present value of expected future cash flows. These expected
future cash flows are based on Cadence’s assumed market
segment growth rates, assumed market segment share growth rates,
estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the
reporting units’ weighted average cost of capital as
determined by considering the observable weighted average cost
of capital of comparable companies. Cadence’s estimates of
market segment growth, market segment share growth and costs are
based on historical data, various internal estimates and a
variety of external sources, and are developed as part of
Cadence’s routine long-range planning process.

The market approach provides an estimate of the fair value of
the equity of a business by comparing it to publicly traded
companies in similar lines of business. The conditions and
prospects of companies in similar lines of business depend on
common factors such as overall demand for their products and
services. Factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and
return on investment are also analyzed and compared to
comparable companies. Various price or market multiples are then
applied to the reporting units’ operating results to arrive
at an estimate of fair value.



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

January 1, 2005

In determining its overall conclusion of reporting unit fair
value, management considers the estimated values derived from
both the income and market valuation approaches. The weighting
applied to the market approach depends on the similarity of the
comparable businesses to the reporting unit.

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years
ended January  1, 2005 and January 3, 2004 are as
follows:

Goodwill resulting from acquisitions during the year includes
adjustments to the initial allocation of the purchase price.
During the year ended January  3, 2004, Cadence
recorded other adjustments of $2.2 million in the carrying
amount of goodwill primarily as a result of an $8.9 million
reduction from previous estimates to contingent earnout relating
to acquisitions, offset by adjustments to the initial purchase
price relating to certain acquisitions made during 2003 totaling
$6.7 million.

Acquired Intangibles,

January 1, 2005

The following tables summarize Cadence’s cash, cash
equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments as
of January 3, 2004:

Marketable Securities

Net realized gains from the sale of marketable securities were
$6.8 million in 2004, $0 in 2003 and $9.2 million in
2002. Recognized losses from the other-than-temporary declines
in the market value of marketable securities totaled
$0.7 million in 2004. There were no recognized losses from
the other-than-temporary declines in the market value of
marketable securities in 2003 or 2002.

Non-Marketable
Securities

Cadence uses either the cost or equity method of accounting to
account for its long-term, non-marketable investment securities,
which are included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets. Net realized gains on the sale of non-marketable
investments were $5.7 million in 2004, $0 in 2003 and
$15.7 million in 2002. If Cadence determines that an
other-than-temporary decline exists in a non-marketable equity
security, Cadence writes down the investment to its fair value
and records the related write-down as an investment loss in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, Cadence adopted
EITF No. 02-14, “Whether an Investor Should Apply the
Equity Method of Accounting to Investments Other Than Common
Stock,” which requires the equity method of accounting for
investments in which Cadence has significant influence and holds
common stock or in-substance common stock. For certain
investments previously accounted for under the equity method,
Cadence determined that it had a substantive liquidation
preference over the common shareholders for these investments
were not in-substance common stock because of the remaining
value attributable to the common shareholders. During the first
three quarters of 2004, Cadence recognized $0.3 million of
equity method losses attributable to the investments previously
accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

Partners III, L.P.:

During the fourth quarter of 2004, Cadence determined that
$10.7 million of investments previously accounted for under
the equity method of accounting will be accounted for under the
cost method of accounting as a result of the adoption of EITF
No. 02-14.

Cost Method
Investments

Cadence recorded write-downs due to other-than-temporary
declines in value of non-marketable securities carried on the
cost basis of $1.5 million in 2004, $4.8 million in
2003 and $14.1 million in 2002. These write-downs are
included in Other expense, net, in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations.

Equity Method
Investments

During the first three quarters of 2004 and all of 2003 and 2002
prior to the adoption of EITF No. 02-14, Cadence’s
voting interest held in the form of preferred stock ranged from
approximately 10% to 49% of the following privately-held
companies: Accent S.r.l., Ammocore Technology, Inc., Clear Shape
Technologies, Inc., Coventor, Inc., CoWare, Inc., E-Z-CAD, Inc.,
Fyre Storm, Inc., Hierarchical Design, Inc., Integrated Memory

Microelectronics, Inc. and ZCIST Co., Ltd. On April 15,
2004, Cadence acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of
Neolinear, Inc, as more fully described above in Note 4.

After the adoption of EITF No. 02-14, Cadence’s voting
interest ranged from approximately 18% to 49% of the following
privately-held companies, which remain accounted for under the
equity method of accounting: Accent S.r.l., Ammocore Technology,
Inc., Fyre Storm, Inc., Theta Microelectronics, Inc. and ZCIST

losses was $16.9 million in 2004, $10.9 million in
2003 and $9.4 million in 2002. As of January 1, 2005,
the difference between Cadence’s investment in the investee
and Cadence’s share of the underlying net assets of the
investee was immaterial.

Cadence recorded write-downs due to other-than-temporary
declines in value of non-marketable securities accounted for
under the equity method of accounting of $2.0 million
during 2004. There were no write-downs due to
other-than-temporary declines in value of non-marketable
securities accounted for under the equity method of accounting
during 2003 and 2002. These write-downs are included in Other
expense, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

NOTE 7. CONVERTIBLE NOTES

In August 2003, Cadence issued $420.0 million principal
amount of Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes due
2023, or the Notes, to two initial purchasers in a private
offering for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant
to SEC Rule 144A. Cadence received net proceeds of
approximately $406.4 million after transaction fees of
approximately $13.6 million that were recorded in Other
assets and are being amortized to interest expense using the
straight-line method over five years, which is the duration of
the first redemption period. The Notes were issued by Cadence at
par and bear no interest. The Notes are convertible into Cadence
common stock initially at a conversion price of $15.65 per
share, which would result in an aggregate of 26.8 million
shares issued upon conversion, subject to adjustment upon the
occurrence of specified events. Cadence may redeem for cash all
or any part of the Notes on or after August 15, 2008 for
100.00% of the principal amount. The holders may require Cadence
to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes on
August 15, 2008 for 100.25% of the principal amount, on
August 15, 2013 for 100.00% of the principal amount or on
August 15, 2018 for 100.00% of the principal amount. The
Notes do not contain any restrictive financial covenants.

Each $1,000 of principal of the Notes will initially be
convertible into 63.8790 shares of Cadence common stock,
subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events.
Holders of the Notes may convert their Notes prior to maturity
only if: (1) the price of Cadence’s common stock
reaches $22.69 during certain periods of time specified in the
Notes, (2) specified corporate transactions occur,
(3) the Notes have been called for redemption or
(4) the trading price of the Notes falls below a certain
threshold. As this fourth conversion feature is linked to the
trading price of the Notes, which are traded in an observable
market that differs from the one in which Cadence’s common
stock is traded, the conversion feature meets the definition of
a derivative that must be accounted for separately at fair
value. The fair value of this conversion feature was not
material at inception of the Notes or as of January 1,
2005. As of January 1, 2005, none of the conditions
allowing holders of the Notes to convert had been met.

In addition, in the event of a significant change in
Cadence’s corporate ownership or structure, the holders may
require Cadence to repurchase all or any portion of their Notes
for 100% of the principal amount. Upon a significant change in
Cadence’s corporate ownership or structure, in certain
circumstances, Cadence may choose to pay the repurchase price in
cash, shares of Cadence’s common stock or a combination of
cash and shares of Cadence’s common stock.

In November 2003, Cadence filed with the SEC a resale
registration statement with respect to the Notes. This
registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on
April 29, 2004.

Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, Cadence entered
into convertible notes hedge transactions with JP Morgan Chase
Bank whereby Cadence has the option to purchase up to
26.8 million shares of Cadence’s common stock at a
price of $15.65 per share. These options expire on
August 15, 2008 and must be settled in net shares. The cost
of the convertible notes hedge transactions to Cadence was
approximately $134.6 million.



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

January 1, 2005

In addition, Cadence sold warrants to JP Morgan Chase Bank for
the purchase of up to 26.8 million shares of Cadence’s
common stock at a price of $23.08 per share. The warrants
expire on various dates from February 2008 through May 2008 and
must be settled in net shares. Cadence received approximately
$56.4 million in cash proceeds for the sales of these
warrants.

The costs incurred in connection with the convertible notes
hedge transactions and the proceeds from the sale of the
warrants are included as a net reduction in common stock and
capital in excess of par in the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets as of January 1, 2005 and January 3,
2004, in accordance with the guidance in EITF No. 00-19,
“Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed
to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own
Stock.” As of January  1, 2005, the estimated
fair value of the convertible notes hedge was
$100.8 million and the estimated fair value of the sold
warrants was $32.2 million, however subsequent changes in
the fair value of these convertible notes hedge and warrant
transactions will not be recognized as long as the instruments
remain classified in equity.

On September 30, 2004, the FASB reached a consensus on EITF
No. 04-08, “Accounting Issues Related to Certain
Features of Contingently Convertible Debt and the Effect on
Diluted Earnings per Share.” For all periods in which the
Notes are outstanding, EITF No. 04-08 requires Cadence to
include in diluted earnings per share the approximately
26.8 million shares of Cadence common stock into which the
Notes may be converted, using the “if-converted”
method. The adoption of EITF No. 04-08 required Cadence to
restate previously reported diluted earnings per share for all
periods in which the Notes were outstanding. EITF No. 04-08
became effective in the fourth quarter of 2004. EITF
No. 04-08 did not impact the full fiscal year 2003.

Because Cadence entered into the Notes hedge transactions and
the sale of the warrants, upon conversion of the Notes there
will be no other impact on basic or dilutive EPS, except as
described above under EITF No. 04-08, unless the price of
Cadence’s common stock exceeds the warrant strike price of
$23.08 per share. Up to $23.08 per share, in
connection with any conversion, the operation of the Notes hedge
transactions and sale of the warrants would effectively result
in no impact on basic or dilutive EPS. In the event
Cadence’s common stock exceeds $23.08 per share, for
the first $1.00 the price exceeds $23.08, there would be
dilution of approximately 1.1 million shares and the impact
on the calculation of EPS will vary depending on when during the
quarter the $23.08 per share price is reached. As this
share price continues to increase, dilution would continue to
occur but at a declining rate. If these transactions settle in
Cadence’s favor, Cadence could be exposed to credit risk
related to the other party to the transactions.

Subsequent to the issuance of the Notes, Cadence terminated its
senior credit facilities.

NOTE 8. LEASE COMMITMENTS

Equipment and facilities are leased under various operating
leases expiring at various dates through the year 2025. Certain
of these leases contain renewal options. Rental expense was
$25.6 million for 2004, $23.3 million for 2003 and
$23.3 million for 2002.

Of the $146.2 million in net operating lease payments,
$33.7 million was accrued in restructuring expense prior to
January 1, 2005 and will be charged against the
restructuring accrual as paid.

The cost of equipment previously acquired under capital leases
included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as property, plant
and equipment was $0.2 million as of January 1, 2005
and $6.6 million as of January 3, 2004. Accumulated
amortization of the leased equipment was $0.1 million as of
January 1, 2005 and $6.2 million as of January 3,
2004.

NOTE 9. CONTINGENCIES

Legal Proceedings

From time to time, Cadence is involved in various disputes and
litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of
business. These include disputes and lawsuits related to
intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, licensing,
contract law, distribution arrangements and employee relations
matters. Periodically, Cadence reviews the status of each
significant matter and assesses its potential financial
exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal
proceeding is considered probable and a range of possible losses
can be estimated, Cadence accrues a liability for the estimated
loss at the low end of the range. Legal proceedings are subject
to uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to predict.
Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based only on the
best information available at the time. As additional
information becomes available, Cadence reassesses the potential
liability related to pending claims and litigation matters and
may revise estimates.

While the outcome of these litigation matters cannot be
predicted with any certainty, management does not believe that
the outcome of any current matters will have a material adverse
effect on Cadence’s consolidated financial position or
results of operations.

Other Contingencies

Cadence provides its customers with a warranty on sales of
hardware products for a 90-day period. These warranties are
accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 5,
“Accounting for Contingencies.” To date, Cadence has
not incurred any significant costs related to warranty
obligations.

Cadence’s product license and services agreements include a
limited indemnification provision for claims from third parties
relating to Cadence’s intellectual property. Such
indemnification provisions are accounted

for in accordance with SFAS No. 5. The indemnification
is generally limited to the amount paid by the customer. To
date, claims under such indemnification provisions have not been
significant.

NOTE 10. LEGAL SETTLEMENTS

Mentor Graphics
Settlement

In September 2003, Cadence entered into a settlement with Mentor
Graphics Corporation, pursuant to which Cadence, Mentor and
their respective affiliated parties settled all outstanding
litigation between the companies and such affiliated parties
relating to emulation and acceleration systems. The companies
also agreed that, for a period of seven years, neither will sue
the other over patented emulation and acceleration technology.
Mentor also paid Cadence $18.0 million in cash as part of
the settlement. Net of related legal costs, Cadence recorded a
gain for the settlement of $14.5 million during the year
ended January  3, 2004.

Avant! Civil
Settlement

In November 2002, Cadence announced the settlement of civil
litigation filed against Avant! Corporation seeking damages
related to theft of Cadence intellectual property, including
software code, as well as other trade secrets. The settlement
with Avant!, its parent corporation Synopsys, Inc. and several
individuals included an agreement to dismiss all pending claims
and counterclaims in the litigation and required the payment to
Cadence of $265.0 million, which amount was received in the
fourth quarter of 2002. Net of related legal costs, Cadence
recorded a gain for the settlement of $261.1 million during

Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net
income (loss), the numerator, by the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding, the denominator, during the
period. Diluted net income per share gives effect to equity
instruments considered to be potential common shares, if
dilutive, computed using the treasury stock method of accounting.

Cadence accounts for the effect of its Notes in the diluted
earnings per common share calculation using the if-converted
method of accounting. Under that method, the Notes are assumed
to be converted to shares (weighted for the number of days
outstanding in the period) at a conversion price of $15.65, and
amortization of transaction fees, net of taxes, related to the
Notes is added back to net income (loss).

of Directors approved an amendment to the 1995 Directors
Stock Option Plan to increase the number of shares of common
stock authorized for issuance under the 1995 Directors
Stock Option Plan by 500,000 shares for a total of

2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

Cadence has assumed certain options granted to employees of
acquired companies, or Acquired Options. The Acquired Options
were assumed by Cadence outside of its stock option plans, and
each option is administered under the terms of the respective
original plan of the acquired entity. All of the Acquired
Options have been adjusted to effectuate the price conversion
under the terms of the acquisition agreement between Cadence and
the relevant acquired company. The Acquired Options generally
become exercisable over a four or five year period and generally
expire between five and ten years from the date of grant. No
additional options will be granted under any of the acquired
companies’ plans.

Employee Stock Purchase
Plans

On July 1, 2001, Cadence adopted two employee stock
purchase plans to allow employees of Tality, the former name of
Cadence’s design services subsidiary, to participate in
Cadence’s employee stock purchase

program. The two plans included the 2001 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan, which was a qualified employee stock purchase plan under
the Internal Revenue Code terminated in January 2003, and the
2001 Non-Qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the 2001
Non-Qualified ESPP, which is an employee stock purchase plan not
qualified under the Internal Revenue Code and primarily used for
Tality employees located outside the United States. Tality, now
Cadence Design Foundry, employees, including officers and
employee directors of Tality, but excluding 5% or greater
stockholders, are eligible to participate if they are regular
employees who work 20 hours or more per week. Under
Cadence’s 2001 Non-Qualified ESPP, eligible employees,
which are generally Cadence’s non-U.S. Design Foundry
employees, may purchase shares of Cadence common stock during
offering periods (not to exceed 27 months) and on purchase
dates as determined by the Board of Directors. The purchase
price of such shares is equal to 85% of the lower of the fair
market value of Cadence common stock on (i) the first day
of the offering period, or (ii) the last day of the
applicable purchase period. The total shares authorized under
the 2001 Non-Qualified ESPP are 750,000 and as of the end of
fiscal year 2004, 527,671 shares remained available for
issuance. The 2001 Non-Qualified ESPP was terminated in February
2005.

In November 1998, the Board of Directors adopted, and the
stockholders subsequently approved, Cadence’s Amended and
Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which amended and
restated the 1990 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the Employee
Plan. Subsequent amendments approved by the Board of Directors
and stockholders increased the number of shares of common stock
authorized for issuance under the Employee Plan to
38,500,000 shares.

Under the terms of the Employee Plan, employees can choose to
have up to 12% of their annual base earnings plus bonuses
withheld to purchase Cadence common stock. The purchase price of
the stock is 85% of the lower of the fair market value of
Cadence common stock as of the (i) first day of the
offering period or (ii) last day of the applicable purchase
period. The offering periods provide for concurrent
24 month offering periods with a new 24 month offering
period starting every six months. Each offering period will be
divided into four consecutive six-month purchase periods.

The following table presents the common shares issued under
Cadence’s employee stock purchase plans for fiscal years
2004, 2003 and 2002:

Deferred Stock
Compensation

In 2004, Cadence recorded stock compensation expense resulting
from Cadence’s previously completed acquisitions. Deferred
stock compensation resulting from these acquisitions represents
the intrinsic value of the stock option grants to employees of
the acquired companies multiplied by the percentage of the
remaining vesting period divided by the total vesting period.
Cadence considers certain stock awards to employees of certain
acquired companies to be variable awards. Accordingly,
compensation cost is adjusted each period for increases or
decreases in the intrinsic value of the shares until the final
measurement date.

During 2004, Cadence issued 3,470,938 shares of restricted
stock to certain employees. The restrictions lapse over a period
of three to four years. The fair value of the restricted stock
awards granted was $45.6 million. The fair value of the
restricted stock awards was recorded as a component of deferred
stock compensation and is amortized to stock-based compensation
expense as the restrictions lapse.

Cadence’s SPC Plan provides for the issuance of restricted
shares of Cadence common stock to former employees of Silicon
Perspective Corporation, or SPC, who are now Cadence employees,
upon the satisfaction of certain performance-based criteria in
connection with Cadence’s acquisition of SPC. Restricted
shares were first issued under the SPC Plan in February 2003 and
54% of such issued shares vested immediately. The remaining 46%
vested in 11 equal monthly installments beginning in
February 2003 and became fully vested on December 31, 2003.
The second issue date was in April 2004, and these shares were
fully vested when issued. An aggregate of approximately
1.6 million shares were issued and recognized as stock
compensation expense under the SPC Plan.

Changes to deferred compensation included in the accompanying
Statements of Stockholders’ Equity consists of the
following for the years ended January 1, 2005 and
January 3, 2004:

For fixed awards, Cadence amortizes deferred stock compensation
to expense using the straight-line method over the period that
the stock options and restricted stock vest, which is generally
three to four years. For variable awards, stock-based
compensation expense is recognized on an accelerated basis in
accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 28,
“Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other
Variable Stock Option or Award Plans.”

NOTE 13.

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Stock Repurchase Plan

In August 2001, the Cadence Board of Directors authorized a
program to repurchase shares of Cadence’s common stock with
a value of up to $500.0 million in the aggregate. Prior to
August 2001, Cadence had authorized three stock repurchase
programs under which it repurchased common stock to satisfy
estimated requirements for shares to be issued under its
employee stock option and purchase plans.

The table below presents the shares repurchased under
Cadence’s stock repurchase programs in 2004, 2003 and 2002:

As of January 1, 2005, the remaining repurchase
authorization under the August 2001 program totaled
$123.0 million. During 2002, shares valued at
$116.1 million were repurchased under the stock repurchase
plans authorized prior to August 2001.

Stockholder Rights
Plan

Cadence has a stockholder rights plan to protect its
stockholders’ rights in the event of a proposed or actual
acquisition of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Cadence
common stock. As amended in February 2000, each share of Cadence
common stock carries a right to purchase one one-thousandth
(1/1000) of a share of Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Cadence at a
price of $240.00 per one one-thousandth of a share, subject
to adjustment. The rights are subject to redemption at the
option of the Board of Directors at a price of $0.01 per
right until the occurrence of certain events. The rights expire
on February 20, 2006.

NOTE 14.

INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes consisted of the following
components:

Income before provision for income taxes included income from
Cadence’s foreign subsidiaries of approximately
$93.6 million for 2004, $39.3 million for 2003 and
$106.3 million for 2002.

The provision for income taxes differs from the amount estimated
by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% to
income before provision for income taxes as follows:

The components of deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted
of the following:



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

January 1, 2005

Cadence has included in the components of the deferred tax
assets and liabilities for 2003 the deferred tax assets,
liabilities and valuation allowance for states other than
California. The presentation of these amounts did not change the
total net deferred tax assets for 2003 of $89.5 million.

As of January 1, 2005, Cadence had total net deferred tax
assets of approximately $106.8 million. Realization of the
deferred tax assets will depend on generating sufficient taxable
income of the appropriate character from potential sources,
including tax planning strategies, prior to the expiration of
certain net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Although realization is not assured, management
believes that it is more likely than not that the net deferred
tax assets will be realized.

Cadence provides for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of
foreign subsidiaries unless the earnings are considered
permanently invested outside of the United States. As of
January 1, 2005, the cumulative amount of earnings upon
which U.S. income taxes have not been provided was
approximately $575.0 million. As of January 1, 2005,
the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings
excluding any incentives under the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004, or AJCA, was approximately $137.0 million.

The AJCA, enacted on October 22, 2004, created a temporary
incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated
earnings of foreign subsidiaries by providing an 85% dividends
received deduction for certain qualifying dividends. The
deduction is subject to a number of limitations. Although no
decision has been made, Cadence may elect to apply this
provision to qualifying earnings repatriated during fiscal 2005.
Cadence is currently evaluating the merits of repatriating funds
under the AJCA and expects to complete this evaluation by
October 1, 2005. The range of possible amounts that Cadence
is considering for repatriation under this provision is between
zero and $550.0 million. Cadence has historically
considered undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries to
be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, has not provided
for income taxes on these undistributed earnings. If Cadence
decides to repatriate foreign earnings in a future period,
Cadence will be required to recognize income tax expense related
to the federal, state, local and foreign income taxes that
Cadence would incur on the repatriated earnings when the
decision is made. Cadence is currently unable to reasonably
estimate the possible range of income tax effects of such
repatriation.

As of January 1, 2005, Cadence has federal and California
net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$20.8 million and $17.9 million, respectively,
available to reduce future taxable income. The federal net
operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates from
2008 through 2023. The California net operating loss
carryforwards will expire at various dates from 2011 through
2013. Cadence also has tax effected net operating losses from
states other than California of $3.2 million, net of
federal benefit, which will expire at various dates from 2005
through 2024.

As of January 1, 2005, Cadence has federal tax credits of
$0.3 million and state tax credits of $7.2 million,
net of federal benefit, of which $4.8 million do not expire
and carry forward indefinitely until utilized and the remaining
$2.4 million will expire at various dates from 2005 through
2019.

The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine
Cadence’s income tax returns. The IRS recently completed
its field examination of Cadence’s federal income tax
returns for the fiscal years ended 1997 through 1999 and has
issued a Revenue Agent’s Report, or the RAR, in which the
IRS proposes to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the
three-year period of approximately $143.0 million, plus
interest, which interest will accrue until the matter is
resolved. This interest is compounded daily at rates published
by the IRS, which rates have been between four and nine percent
since 1997, and are adjusted quarterly. The IRS may also make
similar claims for years subsequent to 1999 in future
examinations. The RAR is not a final Statutory Notice of
Deficiency, and Cadence has protested certain of the proposed
adjustments with the Appeals Office of the IRS where the matter
is presently being considered. The most significant of the
disputed adjustments relates to transfer pricing arrangements
that Cadence has with a foreign subsidiary. Cadence believes
that the proposed IRS adjustments are inconsistent with the
applicable tax laws, and that Cadence has meritorious defenses
to the proposed adjustments. Cadence intends to challenge these
proposed adjustments vigorously.



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Significant judgment is required in determining Cadence’s
provision for income taxes. In determining the adequacy of
Cadence’s provision for income taxes, Cadence has assessed
the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these
examinations, including the current IRS assessments. However,
the ultimate outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted
with certainty, including the total amount payable or the timing
of any such payments upon resolution of these issues. In
addition, Cadence cannot be assured that such amount will not be
materially different than that which is reflected in
Cadence’s historical income tax provisions and accruals.
Should the IRS or other tax authorities assess additional taxes
as a result of a current or a future examination, Cadence may be
required to record charges to operations in future periods that
could have a material impact on the results of operations,
financial position or cash flows in the period or periods
recorded.

EMPLOYEE AND DIRECTOR BENEFIT PLANS

Cadence maintains a 401(k) savings plan to provide retirement
benefits through tax-deferred salary deductions for all of its
U.S. employees. Cadence may make discretionary
contributions, as determined by the Board of Directors, which
cannot exceed a specified percentage of the annual aggregate
salaries of those employees eligible to participate. Cadence
made total contributions to the plan of $9.6 million for
2004, $9.2 million for 2003 and $10.4 million for 2002.

As part of its overall investment strategy, Cadence invests in
Telos. Cadence and the Cadence Design Systems, Inc. 1996
Deferred Compensation Venture Investment Plan Trust, or the 1996
Plan, are the sole limited partners of Telos I. Cadence and the
Cadence Design Systems, Inc. 2002 Deferred Compensation Venture
Investment Plan Trust, or the 2002 Plan, are the sole limited
partners of Telos III. Directors may elect to defer
compensation payable to them under the 2002 Plan. Compensation
deferred under the plan is invested in Telos III. The Telos
general partner recommends investments by Telos, which
investments are subject to the approval of the advisory
committee, comprised of Cadence’s Chairman of the Board of
Directors and two independent members of Cadence’s Board of
Directors.

Executive Officers and Directors may also elect to defer
compensation payable to them, including income realized upon the
exercise of non-qualified stock options, under Cadence’s
1994 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan. Deferred
compensation payments are held in accounts with values indexed
to the performance of selected mutual funds, employee
self-directed accounts or money market accounts.

RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES

Cadence has initiated a separate plan of restructuring in each
year since 2001, in an effort to reduce operating expenses and
improve operating margins and cash flows.

The restructuring plans initiated in 2001, 2002 and 2003, or the
2001 Restructuring, 2002 Restructuring and 2003 Restructuring,
respectively, were intended to decrease costs by reducing
workforce and consolidating facilities and resources, to align
Cadence’s cost structure with expected revenues. The 2001
and 2002 Restructurings primarily related to Cadence’s
design services business and certain other business or
infrastructure groups throughout the world. The 2003
Restructuring was targeted at reducing costs throughout the
company.

During 2004, Cadence commenced a new plan of restructuring, or
the 2004 Restructuring, which was also intended to decrease
costs and realize efficiencies by reducing workforce and
resources throughout the company to align Cadence’s cost
structure with projected revenues.

Cadence accounts for restructuring charges in accordance with
SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100,
“Restructuring and Impairment Charges.” Since 2001,
Cadence has undertaken significant restructuring initiatives.
The individual components of the restructuring activities
initiated prior to fiscal 2003 were accounted for in accordance
with EITF No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition for Certain
Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring),” and EITF No. 88-10, “Costs
Associated with Lease Modifications or Terminations.”

For restructuring activities initiated after fiscal 2002,
Cadence accounted for the facilities and asset-related portions
of these restructurings in accordance with
SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities.” The severance and
benefits charges were accounted for in accordance with
SFAS No. 112, “Employers’ Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits — An Amendment of FASB
Statements No. 5 and 43.” The asset impairments
recorded in 2004 were accounted for in accordance with
SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”

Closure and space reduction costs included in these
restructurings were comprised of payments required under leases
less any applicable estimated sublease income after the
properties were abandoned, lease buyout costs and costs to
maintain facilities during the period after abandonment. To
estimate the lease loss, which is the loss after Cadence’s
cost recovery efforts from subleasing a building, Cadence
management made certain assumptions related to the time period
over which the relevant building would remain vacant and
sublease terms, including sublease rates and contractual common
area charges.

Since 2001, Cadence has recorded facilities consolidation
charges of $85.2 million related to space reductions or
closures of 34 sites. As of January 1, 2005, 24 of these
sites had been vacated and space reductions occurred at the
remaining 10 sites.

As of January 1, 2005, Cadence’s best estimate of the
accrued lease loss related to all worldwide restructuring
activities initiated since 2001 is $33.7 million. This
amount will be adjusted in the future based upon changes in the
assumptions used to estimate the lease loss. The lease loss
could range as high as $53.2 million if sublease rental
rates decrease in applicable markets or if it takes longer than
currently expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease the
facilities.

Restructuring and other charges (credits) recorded by plan
of restructuring for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002 are as
follows:

Total restructuring and other costs accrued as of
January 1, 2005 were $37.7 million, consisting of
$13.2 million in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities
and $24.5 million in Other long-term liabilities in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cadence expects to pay
substantially all of the asset-related and severance and
benefits-related restructuring liabilities for all its
restructuring plans prior to 2006 and all of the
facilities-related restructuring liabilities for all its
restructuring plans prior to 2016.

Activity for the years ended January 1, 2005,
January 3, 2004 and December  28, 2002 associated
with each plan of restructuring is discussed below.

2004 Restructuring

The 2004 Restructuring resulted in the termination of
approximately 130 employees. Costs resulting from this
restructuring include severance payments, severance-related
benefits and outplacement services. All terminations and
termination benefits associated with this restructuring were
communicated to the affected employees prior to January 1,
2005, with all termination benefits expected to be paid by
July 2, 2005.

Other expenses of $9.4 million related to the abandonment
of third-party software purchased and integrated into an
internal-use software application. During 2004, Cadence replaced
this third-party purchased software with internally developed
technology. Upon deployment of the internally developed
software, Cadence recorded a charge to reduce the value of the
third-party software product and implementation costs to zero.

The following table presents the activity associated with
restructuring and other charges related to the 2004
Restructuring for the year ended January 1, 2005:

2003 Restructuring

During 2004, Cadence recorded a net credit of $2.1 million
related to the 2003 Restructuring. This net credit is comprised
of a $2.8 million credit associated with asset-related
charges, and a $0.8 million severance and benefits credit,
partially offset by $1.5 million of additional excess
facilities charges.

The net $2.8 million asset-related credit was associated
with the reversal of an accrual of approximately
$4.6 million for an expected payment to a government agency
because Cadence has determined it is not probable it will have
any future liability. This reversal was partially offset by a
$1.2 million accrual for fees related to headcount
reductions at a foreign facility. Cadence also reversed
$0.8 million of the severance-related accrual related to
payroll taxes, benefits and outplacement services in excess of
the remaining expected obligation.

Cadence incurred excess facilities expenses of $1.5 million
in the year ended January 1, 2005 related to the 2003
Restructuring. These expenses were primarily comprised of
additional expenses incurred for facilities included in the 2003
Restructuring, but vacated during fiscal 2004. Expenses also
included contract termination charges and expenses incurred to
sublease facilities and storage and disposal charges associated
with facilities vacated as part of the 2003 Restructuring.

NOTE 19. SEGMENT REPORTING

SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information,” requires disclosures
of certain information regarding operating segments, products
and services, geographic areas of operation and major customers.
SFAS No. 131 reporting is based upon the
“management approach”: how

management organizes the company’s operating segments for
which separate financial information is (i) available and
(ii) evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision
maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing
performance. Cadence’s chief operating decision maker is
its President and Chief Executive Officer, or CEO.

During 2004, Cadence combined its three operating segments into
one segment. Cadence’s CEO reviews Cadence’s
consolidated results within only one segment. In making
operating decisions, the CEO primarily considers consolidated
financial information, accompanied by disaggregated information
about revenues by geographic region. In prior years,
Cadence’s chief operating decision maker reviewed
Cadence’s consolidated results within three segments:
Product, Services and Maintenance. As required by
SFAS No. 131, the prior year information in this
footnote has been restated to conform to the current year
presentation.

Outside the U.S., Cadence markets and supports its products and
services primarily through its subsidiaries. Revenue is
attributed to geography based on the country in which the
customer is domiciled. Long-lived assets are attributed to
geography based on the country where the assets are located.
Until June 28, 2003, Cadence licensed most of its software
products in Japan through a distributor, Innotech Corporation,
or Innotech, of which Cadence was a 15% stockholder as of
January 1, 2005. In June 2003, Cadence purchased certain
assets from Innotech, including distribution rights for certain
customers in Japan. Since June 2003, Cadence has directly
licensed its software products to customers for which Cadence
acquired the distribution rights from Innotech. No one customer
accounted for more than 10% of total revenue in 2004, 2003 or
2002.
