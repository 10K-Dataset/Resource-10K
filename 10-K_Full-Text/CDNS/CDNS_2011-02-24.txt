Factors
    Driving the Electronic Design Automation Industry

In 2009, the semiconductor industry’s sales declined as the
    global macroeconomic environment was negatively affected by
    decreased consumer spending, high unemployment, and restrained
    corporate spending. During this period, electronics companies
    faced increased financial pressures, in addition to the
    traditional challenges of cost, quality, innovation and

time-to-market

associated with development of highly complex electronics
    systems and integrated circuit, or IC, products. In 2010, the
    semiconductor industry grew significantly as consumer demand for
    electronic products improved as global economic conditions
    improved. While the EDA industry benefited from this improved
    environment, EDA customers remained cautious about making
    substantial new EDA expenditures. The



semiconductor industry is forecasted to grow modestly in 2011,
    and we believe that spending on EDA offerings may also grow
    modestly as customers invest in new projects.

Electronics companies demand ever higher levels of productivity
    from their design teams, better predictability in their
    development schedules and higher quality products in order to be
    competitive and profitable in the price-conscious markets they
    serve. Electronics companies are responding to demand for
    increased functionality and miniaturization by combining
    subsystems — such as radio frequency, or RF, wireless
    communication, video signal processing and microprocessors
    — onto a single silicon chip, creating a

system-on-chip,

or SoC, or multiple chips into a single chip package in a format
    referred to as

system-in-package,

or SiP. These trends toward subsystem integration have required
    chip makers to find solutions to challenges previously addressed
    by system companies, such as verifying system-level
    functionality and hardware-software interoperability.

Our offerings address many of the challenges associated with
    developing unique silicon circuitry, integrating original
    circuitry with IP developed by third parties to create SoCs, and
    combining ICs and SoCs with software to create electronic
    systems. Our strategy is to provide our customers with the
    ability to address the broad range of issues that arise at the
    silicon, SoC, and system levels. In 2010, we published our
    vision for the industry, called EDA360, which describes in
    detail the challenges and opportunities in EDA. The acquisition
    of Denali Software, Inc., or Denali, supports multiple aspects
    of our strategy to address customer challenges. The most
    significant issues that our customers face in creating their
    products include optimizing energy consumption, manufacturing
    microscopic circuitry, verifying device functionality, and
    achieving technical performance targets, all while meeting
    aggressive cost requirements.

These issues are becoming more complex as requirements for
    performance, size, cost, and features evolve across the full
    spectrum of electronics products, such as smart phones, tablets,
    televisions, communications and internet infrastructure, and
    computing platforms. Providers of EDA solutions must deliver
    products that address these technical challenges while improving
    the productivity, predictability, reliability and profitability
    of the design processes and products of their customers.

Products
    and Product Strategy

Our products are engineered to improve our customers’
    design productivity and design quality by providing a
    comprehensive set of EDA tools and a differentiated portfolio of
    IP. Product revenues include all fees earned from granting
    licenses to use our software and IP, and from sales and leases
    of our hardware products, and exclude revenues derived from
    maintenance and services. See “Product Licensing
    Arrangements” for a discussion of our license types.

We combine our products and technologies into
    “platforms” for four major design activities:

•

Functional Verification;

•

Digital IC Design and Implementation;

•

Custom IC Design and Verification; and

•

System Interconnect Design.

The four
    Cadence

®

design platforms are branded as
    Incisive

®

functional verification,
    Encounter

®

digital IC design,
    Virtuoso

®

custom design and
    Allegro

®

system interconnect design. In addition, we augment these
    platform product offerings with a set of design for
    manufacturing, or DFM, products that service both the digital
    and custom IC design flows.

The products and technologies that comprise our platforms are
    combined with services,

ready-to-use

packages of technologies assembled from our broad portfolio and
    other associated components that provide comprehensive solutions
    for low power, mixed signal, enterprise verification and
    advanced node designs. These solutions and their constituent
    elements are marketed to users who specialize in areas such as
    system design and verification, functional verification, logic
    design, digital implementation, custom IC design and printed
    circuit board, or PCB, and IC package / SiP design.

Our Product revenue was $471.6 million, or 50% of our total
    revenue, during fiscal 2010, $400.8 million, or 47% of our
    total revenue, during fiscal 2009 and $516.6 million, or
    50% of our total revenue, during fiscal 2008. For



an additional description of our Product revenue, see the
    discussion under the heading “Results of Operations”
    under Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Functional
    Verification

Functional Verification products are used by our customers to
    efficiently and effectively verify that the circuitry they have
    designed will perform as intended. This is accomplished in
    advance of actually manufacturing the circuitry, which reduces
    the risk of discovering an error in the completed product. Our
    offerings are comprised of two major categories: Logic
    Verification and System Design and Verification.

Our Logic Verification offering consists of planning, property
    checking, testbench simulation, verification IP, and environment
    capabilities within the Incisive functional verification
    platform. This offering enables our customers to employ
    methodology-driven enterprise-level verification process
    automation, including metric-driven verification planning,
    process tracking and management that allow the coordination of
    verification activities across multiple teams and various
    specialists for rapid verification planning and closure.

Our System Design and Verification offerings consist of
    hardware-assisted verification with emulation and acceleration,
    including the verification computing platform
    Palladium

®

XP,
    Palladium

®

and
    Xtreme

®

platforms, system-level design capabilities, verification IP,
    estimation of SoC cost and performance, consulting services, and
    methodologies that provide customers with automation for
    hardware-software verification and effective system design. In
    addition, this offering provides system power exploration,
    analysis and optimization. The
    QuickCycles

®

program allows customers access to our simulation acceleration
    and emulation products, either on their secure internet site or
    remotely over a high-speed, secure network connection.

The products obtained through the acquisition of Denali,
    including verification IP, memory models, and design IP, are
    included in this category of our offerings.

Digital
    IC Design and Implementation

Digital IC offerings are used by our customers to create logical
    representations of a digital circuit or IC that can be verified
    for correctness prior to manufacturing. Once verified, the
    logical representation is implemented, or converted to a format
    ready for silicon manufacturing, using additional software tools
    within this category. Our Digital IC offerings include two major
    categories: Logic Design and Physical Implementation.

Our Logic Design offering is comprised of formal verification,
    equivalency checking, synthesis and test capabilities within the
    Encounter digital IC design platform and property checking,
    simulation, and environment capabilities within the Incisive
    functional verification platform. This offering provides chip
    planning, design, verification and test technologies and
    services to customers across all digital design end markets.
    Logic Design capabilities are aggregated into solutions that
    address our customers’ needs in areas such as power
    efficiency and advanced process nodes.

Our Physical Implementation offering is comprised of a range of
    the Encounter digital IC design platform capabilities. The
    Physical Implementation offering includes timing analysis,
    signal integrity, power analysis, extraction, physical
    verification, and place and route capabilities within the
    Encounter digital IC design platform. This offering enables
    customers to create a physical representation of logic models,
    analyze electrical and physical characteristics of a design and
    prepare a design for manufacturing.

Custom IC
    Design and Verification

Custom IC Design and Verification offerings are used by our
    customers to create schematic representations of circuits down
    to the transistor level for analog, mixed-signal, custom
    digital, memory and RF designs. These logical representations
    are verified using simulation tools optimized for each type of
    design. The offering includes the environment, IC layout and
    simulation capabilities within the Virtuoso custom design
    platform. Other tools in the Custom IC portfolio are used to
    prepare the designs for manufacturing.



System
    Interconnect Design

Our System Interconnect Design offerings are used by our
    customers to develop PCBs and IC packages. The offerings include
    the following capabilities within the Allegro system
    interconnect design platform: PCB, IC package, SiP, design
    management and collaboration. Certain offerings also include the
    simulation capability within the Virtuoso custom design
    platform. These offerings enable engineers who are responsible
    for the capture, layout and analysis of advanced PCB and IC
    packages to design high-performance electronic products across
    the domains of IC, IC package and PCB, to increase functional
    density and to manage design complexity while reducing cost and
    time to market. For the mainstream PCB customers, where
    individual or small team productivity is a focus, we provide the
    OrCAD

®

family of offerings that is marketed worldwide through a network
    of resellers.

Design
    for Manufacturing

With the advent of silicon manufacturing technologies at
    geometries of 65 nanometer and below, our customers are
    increasingly concerned about the manufacturability and yield of
    their designs. The physical layout of each IC requires detailed
    analysis and optimization to ensure that the design can be
    manufactured in volume while performing as expected. Our
    strategy is to integrate DFM awareness into our core design
    platforms of Encounter Digital IC and Virtuoso Custom IC. Some
    of our DFM capabilities include electrical and physical
    lithography checking, chemical-mechanical polishing analysis and
    optimization, pattern matching and optical proximity checking.

Our primary focus in DFM is to address manufacturing effects as
    early in the product development process as possible. As a
    result, we are enhancing the DFM awareness of our core Encounter
    Digital IC and Virtuoso Custom IC product offerings. In addition
    to upstream integration of DFM technologies, we also offer
    stand-alone DFM products.

Third
    Party Programs and Initiatives

In addition to our products, many customers use
    internally-developed design tools or design tools provided by
    other EDA companies, as well as IP available from multiple
    suppliers. We support the use of third-party design products and
    IP through vehicles such as our
    Connections

®

program and through our participation in the OpenAccess
    Coalition, the Power Forward Initiative and other programs and
    initiatives. We also contribute to the development and
    deployment of EDA industry standards.

Maintenance

Customer service and support is critical to the adoption and
    successful use of our products. We provide our customers with
    technical support to facilitate their use of our software, IP
    and hardware solutions.

We offer maintenance to our customers as an integral,
    non-cancelable component of our subscription and most term
    license agreements, as a component of certain other term license
    agreements subject to annual renewal, or as a separate agreement
    subject to annual renewal for our perpetual license customers.

Our Maintenance revenue was $363.5 million, or 39% of our
    total revenue, during fiscal 2010, $345.3 million, or 40%
    of our total revenue, during fiscal 2009 and
    $388.5 million, or 37% of our total revenue, during fiscal
    2008. For an additional description of our Maintenance revenue,
    see the discussion under the heading “Results of
    Operations” under Item 7, “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.”

Services

We offer a number of fee-based services, including engineering
    and education services. These services may be sold separately or
    sold and performed in conjunction with the sale, lease or
    license of our products.

Our Services revenue was $100.9 million, or 11% of our
    total revenue, during fiscal 2010, $106.5 million, or 13%
    of our total revenue, during fiscal 2009 and
    $133.5 million, or 13% of our total revenue, during fiscal
    2008. For



an additional description of our Services revenue, see the
    discussion under the heading “Results of Operations”
    under Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Engineering
    Services

We offer engineering services to aid our customers with the
    design of complex ICs and the implementation of key design
    capabilities, including low power, IC packaging and board
    design, mixed-signal design, functional verification, digital
    implementation, analog/mixed-signal and system-level. The
    customers for these services primarily consist of semiconductor
    and systems companies developing products for the consumer,
    communications, military and aerospace and computing markets.
    These ICs range from digital SoCs, analog and RF designs to
    complex mixed-signal ICs.

We offer engineering capabilities to assist customers from
    product concept to volume manufacturing. We leverage our
    experience and knowledge of design techniques, our products,
    leading practices and different design environments to improve
    the productivity of our customers’ engineering teams.
    Depending on the customers’ projects and needs, we work
    with customers using outsourcing, consultative and collaborative
    offerings. Our Virtual Computer-Aided Design offering enables
    our engineering teams at one or more of our locations to
    collaborate with our customers’ teams located elsewhere in
    the world during the course of their design and engineering
    projects through a secure network infrastructure. We also make
    our design IP portfolio available to customers as part of our
    technology and services solutions. These reusable design and
    methodology components enable us to efficiently deliver our
    services and allow our customers to reduce the design complexity
    and time to market when developing complex SoCs.

Through collaboration with our customers, we are able to design
    advanced ICs and gain direct and early visibility to industry
    design issues that may not be addressed adequately by
    today’s EDA technologies. This enables us to target and
    accelerate the development of new software technology and
    products to satisfy current and future design requirements.

Education
    Services

Our education services offerings can be customized and include
    training programs that are conducted via the internet or in a
    classroom setting. The content of these offerings ranges from
    the latest IC design techniques to methodologies for using the
    most recent features of our EDA products. The primary focus of
    education services is to accelerate our customers’ path to
    productivity in the use of our products.

Marketing
    and Sales

We generally market our products and provide maintenance and
    services to existing and prospective customers through a direct
    sales force consisting of sales people and applications
    engineers. Applications engineers provide technical pre-sales
    and post-sales support for software products. Due to the
    complexity of many of our EDA products and the electronic design
    process, the sales cycle is generally long, requiring three to
    six months or more. During the sales cycle, our direct sales
    force generally provides technical presentations, product
    demonstrations and support for

on-site

customer evaluation of our solutions. We also promote our
    products and services through advertising, direct mail, trade
    shows, public relations and the internet. We selectively utilize
    value added resellers to broaden our reach and reduce cost of
    sales. All OrCAD and selected Incisive products are primarily
    marketed through these channels. With respect to international
    sales, we generally market and support our products and services
    through our subsidiaries. We also use a third-party distributor
    to sell our products and services to certain customers in Japan.

Product
    Licensing Arrangements

We sell software using three license types: subscription, term
    and perpetual. Customers who prefer to license technology for a
    specified, limited period of time will choose either a
    subscription or term license, and customers who prefer to have
    the right to use the technology continuously without time
    restriction will choose a perpetual license. Customers who
    desire to use new technology during the life of the contract
    will select a subscription license, which allows them limited
    access to unspecified new technology on a

when-and-if-available

basis, as



opposed to a term or perpetual license, which does not include
    rights to use new technology. Payment terms for subscription and
    term licenses generally provide for payments to be made in
    installments over the license period and payment terms for
    perpetual licenses generally are net 30 days.

We offer a delivery mechanism for term and subscription licenses
    called eDA Cards. eDA cards have an overall value amount that
    customers draw down against as they select specific products
    that are priced based on the particular duration of use the
    customer desires. The selection and licensing of the specific
    products is accomplished through an automated on-line system.
    The card expires when its total value is consumed by the
    customer, or on the pre-determined expiration date, whichever
    comes first. There are two types of eDA Cards. An eDA Gold Card
    is a term license that enables a customer to access a
    predetermined list of existing products. An eDA Platinum Card is
    a subscription license that enables a customer limited access to
    existing and new technology.

We generally license our IP under nonexclusive license
    agreements that provide usage rights for specific applications.
    Fees under these licenses are typically charged on a per design
    basis. We also sell and lease our hardware products.

For a further description of our license agreements, revenue
    recognition policies and results of operations, please refer to
    the discussion under the heading “Critical Accounting
    Estimates” under Item 7, “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.”

Backlog

Our backlog as of January 1, 2011 was approximately
    $1.7 billion, as compared to approximately
    $1.6 billion as of January 2, 2010, and consists of
    revenue to be recognized in fiscal periods after January 1, 2011
    for fully executed arrangements with effective dates no later
    than April 2, 2011, which is the last day of our first quarter
    of fiscal 2011, and from a variety of license types, which
    generally include, but are not limited to:

•

Licenses for software products and IP;

•

Sale or lease of hardware;

•

Maintenance contracts on hardware and software products;

•

Orders for hardware and software products sold on perpetual and
    term licenses on which customers have delivery dates after
    January 1, 2011;

•

Licenses with payments that are outside our customary
    terms; and

•

The undelivered portion of engineering services contracts.

The substantial majority of our backlog is generated by our
    product and maintenance businesses because customer licenses
    generally include both product and maintenance components.
    Historically, we have not experienced significant cancellations
    of our contracts with customers. However, we occasionally
    reschedule the required completion dates of engineering services
    contracts, deferring revenue recognition under those contracts
    beyond the original anticipated completion date. Changes in
    customer license types or payment terms also can affect the
    timing of revenue recognition. During fiscal 2010, approximately
    75% of our revenue came from orders in backlog as of
    January 2, 2010. We expect approximately 80% of our fiscal
    2011 revenue to come from our backlog as of January 1, 2011.

Revenue
    Seasonality

In the third quarter of fiscal 2008, we began transitioning to a
    license mix that includes a higher proportion of arrangements
    requiring ratable revenue recognition. Prior to this transition,
    revenue was generally lowest in our first quarter and highest in
    our fourth quarter, with a material decline between the fourth
    quarter of one year and the first quarter of the following year.
    However, the transition to a more ratable license mix means that
    revenue may no longer follow our historical quarterly pattern.

Research
    and Development

Our investment in research and development was
    $376.4 million during fiscal 2010, $354.7 million
    during fiscal 2009 and $457.9 million during fiscal 2008.



The primary areas of our research and development include SoC
    design, the design of silicon devices, high-performance IC
    packaging, SiP and PCB design, system-level modeling and
    verification, high-performance logic verification technology, IP
    and hardware/software co-verification. The electronics industry
    combines rapid innovation with rapidly increasing design and
    manufacturing complexity, so we make significant investments in
    enhancing our current products, as well as creating new products
    and technologies and integrating those products and technologies
    together into segmented solutions.

Our future performance depends largely on our ability to
    maintain and enhance our current product development and
    commercialization, to develop, acquire or operate with new
    products from third parties, and to develop solutions that meet
    increasingly demanding productivity, quality, predictability and
    cost requirements on a schedule that keeps pace with our
    customers’ technical developments and industry standards.

Manufacturing
    and Software Distribution

We perform final assembly and testing of our verification,
    acceleration and emulation hardware products at our headquarters
    in San Jose, California. Subcontractors manufacture all
    major subassemblies, including all individual PCBs and custom
    ICs, and supply them for qualification and testing before their
    incorporation into the assembled product.

Software and documentation are primarily distributed to
    customers by secure electronic delivery or on DVD.

Proprietary
    Technology

Our success depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology.
    We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade
    secret laws, licenses and restrictive agreements to establish
    and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products.
    Many of our products include software or other intellectual
    property licensed from third parties. We may have to seek new
    licenses or renew existing licenses for third party software and
    other intellectual property in the future. As part of performing
    engineering services for customers, our engineering services
    business uses certain software and other intellectual property
    licensed from third parties, including that of our competitors.

Competition

We compete in EDA software products and maintenance primarily
    with three companies: Synopsys, Inc., Mentor Graphics
    Corporation and Magma Design Automation, Inc. We also compete
    with numerous smaller EDA companies, with manufacturers of
    electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to
    develop their own EDA products, and with numerous electronics
    design and consulting companies. In the area of IP, we compete
    with Synopsys, Inc. and numerous smaller IP companies. We
    generally compete on the basis of quality, product features,
    level of integration or compatibility with other tools, price,
    payment terms and maintenance offerings.

It is our strategy to use engineering services as a
    differentiator to further promote our products and maintenance
    businesses. Certain competitive factors in the engineering
    services business as described herein differ from those of the
    products and maintenance businesses. While we do compete with
    other EDA companies in the engineering services business, our
    principal competitors include independent engineering service
    businesses. These companies vary greatly in focus, geographic
    location, capability, cost structure and pricing. We compete
    with these companies by focusing on the design of complex
    analog, digital and mixed-signal ICs and SoCs.

International
    Operations

We have 48 sales offices, design centers and research and
    development facilities, approximately two-thirds of which are
    located outside of the United States. We consider customer sales
    and support requirements, the availability of a skilled
    workforce, and costs and efficiencies, among other relative
    benefits, when determining what operations to locate
    internationally. For an additional description of our
    international operations, see the discussion under the heading
    “The effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other
    risks to our international operations may seriously harm our
    financial condition” under Item 1A, “Risk
    Factors” and Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial
    Statements.



Employees

As of January 1, 2011, we employed approximately 4,600
    individuals, including approximately 95 employees whose
    positions were eliminated in restructuring activities announced
    in the first quarter of fiscal 2011.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Our business faces many risks. Described below are what we
    believe to be the material risks that we face. If any of the
    events or circumstances described in the following risks
    actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of
    operations could suffer.

Risks
    Related to Our Business

We are
    subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated circuit and
    electronics systems industries, and any downturn in these
    industries may reduce our orders and revenue.

Purchases of our products and services are dependent upon the
    commencement of new design projects by IC manufacturers and
    electronics systems companies. The IC and electronics systems
    industries are cyclical and are characterized by constant and
    rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price
    erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and wide
    fluctuations in product supply and demand.

The IC and electronics systems industries experienced
    significant challenges in 2008 and 2009. The IC and electronic
    systems industries have also experienced significant downturns
    in connection with, or in anticipation of, maturing product
    cycles of both these industries’ and their customers’
    products. The economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 was
    characterized by diminished product demand, production
    overcapacity, high inventory levels and significant decreases in
    average selling prices. This economic downturn in the industries
    we serve contributed to the reduction in our revenue in 2008 and
    2009, as compared to our revenue in 2007. Although the
    semiconductor industry experienced growth in 2010, and is
    expected to grow modestly in 2011, we believe that spending on
    EDA products and services may grow more slowly than the
    semiconductor industry as a whole in 2011.

We have
    experienced varied operating results, and our operating results
    for any particular fiscal period are affected by the timing of
    significant orders for our software products, fluctuations in
    customer preferences for license types and the timing of revenue
    recognition under those license types.

We have experienced, and may continue to experience, varied
    operating results. In particular, we incurred net losses during
    fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009, we recorded net income in 2010, and
    we may incur a net loss in the future. Various factors affect
    our operating results and some of them are not within our
    control. Our operating results for any period are affected by
    the timing of certain orders for our software products.

Our operating results are also affected by the mix of license
    types executed in any given period. We license software using
    three different license types: subscription, term and perpetual.
    Product revenue associated with term and perpetual licenses that
    include a stated annual maintenance renewal rate is recognized
    upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or
    delivery of the software product. Product revenue associated
    with term licenses that do not include a stated annual
    maintenance renewal rate and Product revenue associated with
    subscription licenses is recognized over multiple periods during
    the term of the license. Revenue may also be deferred until
    payments become due and payable from customers with nonlinear
    payment terms or as cash is collected from customers with lower
    credit ratings. In addition, revenue is affected by the timing
    of license renewals, changes in existing contractual
    arrangements with customers and the mix of license types (i.e.,
    perpetual, term or subscription) for existing customers. These
    changes could have the effect of accelerating or delaying the
    recognition of revenue from the timing of recognition under the
    original contract. Our license mix has changed such that a
    substantial proportion of licenses require ratable revenue
    recognition, and we expect the license mix, combined with the
    modest growth in spending by our customers in the semiconductor
    sector, may make it difficult for us to significantly increase
    our revenue in future fiscal periods.

We plan operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted
    revenue levels. These expenses and the effect of long-term
    commitments are relatively fixed in the short term. In addition,
    revenue levels are harder to forecast in a difficult economic
    environment. If the macroeconomic environment weakens, and we
    experience a shortfall in revenue, our operating results could
    differ from our expectations because we may not be able to
    quickly reduce our expenses in response to short-term business
    changes.



The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our
    accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of
    operations (see “Critical Accounting Estimates” under
    Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations”). Such
    methods, estimates and judgments are, by their nature, subject
    to substantial risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and factors
    may arise over time that may lead us to change our methods,
    estimates and judgments. Changes in those methods, estimates and
    judgments could significantly affect our results of operations.

You should not view our historical results of operations as
    reliable indicators of our future performance. If our revenue,
    operating results or business outlook for future periods fall
    short of the levels expected by securities analysts or
    investors, the trading price of our common stock could decline.

Our
    failure to respond quickly to technological developments could
    make our products uncompetitive and obsolete.

The industries in which we compete experience rapid technology
    developments, changes in industry standards and customer
    requirements and frequent new product introductions and
    improvements. Currently, the industries we serve are
    experiencing the following trends:

•

Migration to nanometer design — the continuous
    shrinkage of the size of process features and other features,
    such as wires, transistors and contacts on ICs, due to the
    ongoing advances in the semiconductor manufacturing
    processes — represents a major challenge for
    participants in the semiconductor industry, from IC design and
    design automation to design of manufacturing equipment and the
    manufacturing process itself. Shrinking transistor sizes are
    challenging the industry in the application of more complex
    physics and chemistry in order to produce advanced silicon
    devices. For EDA tools, models of each component’s
    electrical properties and behavior become more complex as do
    requisite analysis, design and verification capabilities. Novel
    design tools and methodologies must be invented quickly to
    remain competitive in the design of electronics in the smallest
    nanometer ranges.

•

The challenges of nanometer design are leading some customers to
    work with older, less risky manufacturing processes that may
    reduce their need to upgrade or enhance their EDA products and
    design flows.

•

The ability to design SoCs increases the complexity of managing
    a design that, at the lowest level, is represented by billions
    of shapes on fabrication masks. In addition, SoCs typically
    incorporate microprocessors and digital signal processors that
    are programmed with software, requiring simultaneous design of
    the IC and the related software embedded on the IC.

•

With the availability of seemingly endless gate capacity, there
    is an increase in design reuse, or the combining of

off-the-shelf

design IP with custom logic to create ICs or SoCs. The lack of
    availability of a broad range of high-quality design IP
    (including our own) that can be reliably incorporated into a
    customer’s design with our software products and services
    could lead to reduced demand for our products and services.

•

Increased technological capability of the Field-Programmable
    Gate Array, which is a programmable logic chip, creates an
    alternative to IC implementation for some electronics companies.
    This could reduce demand for our IC implementation products and
    services.

•

A growing number of low-cost engineering services businesses
    could reduce the need for some IC companies to invest in EDA
    products.

If we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these
    trends, we may lose our competitive position, and our products
    or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete. To compete
    successfully, we must develop or acquire new products and
    improve our existing products and processes on a schedule that
    keeps pace with technological developments and the requirements
    for products addressing a broad spectrum of designers and
    designer expertise in our industries. We must also be able to
    support a range of changing computer software, hardware
    platforms and customer preferences. We cannot guarantee that we
    will be successful in this effort.



Our stock
    price has been subject to significant fluctuations, and may
    continue to be subject to fluctuations.

The market price of our common stock has experienced significant
    fluctuations and may fluctuate or decline in the future, and as
    a result you could lose the value of your investment. The market
    price of our common stock may be affected by a number of
    factors, including, but not limited to:

•

Announcements of our quarterly operating results and revenue and
    earnings forecasts that fail to meet or are inconsistent with
    earlier projections or the expectations of our securities
    analysts or investors;

•

Changes in our orders, revenue or earnings estimates;

•

Announcements of a restructuring plan;

•

Changes in management;

•

A gain or loss of a significant customer or market segment share;

•

Material litigation;

•

Announcements of new products or acquisitions of new
    technologies by us, our competitors or our customers; and

•

Market conditions in the IC, electronics systems and
    semiconductor industries.

In addition, equity markets in general, and the equities of
    technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme
    price and volume fluctuations. Such price and volume
    fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common
    stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results.

Litigation
    could adversely affect our financial condition or
    operations.

We are currently, and in the future may be, involved in various
    disputes and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of
    business. These include disputes and lawsuits related to
    intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, licensing,
    contracts, distribution arrangements and employee relations
    matters. We are also currently engaged in a consolidated
    securities class action lawsuit and shareholder derivative
    lawsuits. For information regarding the litigation matters in
    which we are currently engaged, please refer to the discussion
    under Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” and
    Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We cannot
    provide any assurances that the final outcome of these lawsuits
    or any other proceedings that may arise in the future will not
    have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
    results, financial condition or cash flows. Litigation can be
    time-consuming and expensive and could divert management’s
    time and attention from our business, which could have a
    material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results.

Our
    future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed customer
    base continuing to license or buy additional products, renew
    maintenance agreements and purchase additional
    services.

Our installed customer base has traditionally generated
    additional new license, service and maintenance revenues. In
    future periods, customers may not necessarily license or buy
    additional products or contract for additional services or
    maintenance. In some cases, maintenance is renewable annually at
    a customer’s option, and there are no mandatory payment
    obligations or obligations to license additional software. If
    our customers decide not to renew their maintenance agreements
    or license additional products or contract for additional
    services, or if they reduce the scope of the maintenance
    agreements, our revenue could decrease, which could have an
    adverse effect on our operating results. Our customers, many of
    which are large semiconductor companies, often have significant
    bargaining power in negotiations with us. Mergers or
    acquisitions of our customers can reduce the total level of
    purchases of our software and services, and in some cases,
    increase customers’ bargaining power in negotiations with
    their suppliers, including us.

We depend
    upon our management team and key employees, and our failure to
    attract, train, motivate and retain management and key employees
    may make us less competitive in our industries and therefore
    harm our results of operations.

Our business depends upon the efforts and abilities of our
    executive officers and other key employees, including key
    development personnel. From time to time, there may be changes
    in our management team resulting from the hiring and departure
    of executive officers, and as a result, we may experience
    disruption to our business



that may harm our operating results and our relationships with
    our employees, customers and suppliers may be adversely
    affected. Competition for highly skilled executive officers and
    employees can be intense, particularly in geographic areas
    recognized as high technology centers such as the Silicon Valley
    area, where our principal offices are located, and the other
    locations where we maintain facilities. To attract, retain and
    motivate individuals with the requisite expertise, we may be
    required to grant large numbers of stock options or other
    stock-based incentive awards, which may be dilutive to existing
    stockholders and increase compensation expense, and pay
    significant base salaries and cash bonuses, which could harm our
    operating results. The high cost of training new employees, not
    fully utilizing these employees, or losing trained employees to
    competing employers could also reduce our operating margins and
    harm our business or operating results.

In addition, the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules require stockholder
    approval for new equity compensation plans and significant
    amendments to existing equity compensation plans, including
    increases in shares available for issuance under such plans, and
    prohibit NASDAQ member organizations from giving a proxy to vote
    on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the
    shares has given voting instructions. These regulations could
    make it more difficult for us to grant equity compensation to
    employees in the future. To the extent that these regulations
    make it more difficult or expensive to grant equity compensation
    to employees, we may incur increased compensation costs or find
    it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, which
    could materially and adversely affect our business.

We may
    not receive significant revenue from our current research and
    development efforts for several years, if at all.

Developing EDA technology and integrating acquired technology
    into existing platforms is expensive, and these investments
    often require a long time to generate returns. Our strategy
    involves significant investments in research and development and
    related product opportunities. We believe that we must continue
    to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research
    and development efforts to maintain and improve our competitive
    position. However, we cannot ensure that we will receive
    significant, if any, revenue from these investments.

The
    competition in our industries is substantial and we may not be
    able to continue to successfully compete in our
    industries.

The EDA industry and the commercial electronics engineering
    services industry are highly competitive. If we fail to compete
    successfully in these industries, it could seriously harm our
    business, operating results or financial condition. To compete
    in these industries, we must identify and develop or acquire
    innovative and cost-competitive EDA products, integrate them
    into platforms and market them in a timely manner. We must also
    gain industry acceptance for our engineering services and offer
    better strategic concepts, technical solutions, prices and
    response time, or a combination of these factors, than those of
    our competitors and the internal design departments of
    electronics manufacturers. We may not be able to compete
    successfully in these industries. Factors that could affect our
    ability to succeed include:

•

The development by others of competitive EDA products or
    platforms and engineering services, possibly resulting in a
    shift of customer preferences away from our products and
    services and significantly decreased revenue;

•

Decisions by electronics manufacturers to perform engineering
    services internally, rather than purchase these services from
    outside vendors due to budget constraints or excess engineering
    capacity;

•

The challenges of developing (or acquiring externally-developed)
    technology solutions that are adequate and competitive in
    meeting the requirements of next-generation design challenges;

•

The significant number of current and potential competitors in
    the EDA industry and the low cost of entry;

•

Intense competition to attract acquisition targets, possibly
    making it more difficult for us to acquire companies or
    technologies at an acceptable price or at all; and

•

The combination of two or more of our EDA competitors or
    collaboration among many EDA companies to deliver more
    comprehensive offerings than they could individually.



We compete in the EDA products market with Synopsys, Inc., Magma
    Design Automation, Inc. and Mentor Graphics Corporation. We also
    compete with numerous smaller EDA companies, with manufacturers
    of electronic devices that have developed or have the capability
    to develop their own EDA products, and with numerous electronics
    design and consulting companies.

We may
    need to change our pricing models to compete
    successfully.

The highly competitive markets in which we compete can put
    pressure on us to reduce the prices of our products. If our
    competitors offer deep discounts on certain products in an
    effort to recapture or gain market segment share or to sell
    other software or hardware products, we may then need to lower
    our prices or offer other favorable terms to compete
    successfully. Any such changes would be likely to reduce our
    profit margins and could adversely affect our operating results.
    Any substantial changes to our prices and pricing policies could
    cause sales and software license revenues to decline or be
    delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust
    to the new pricing policies. Some of our competitors may bundle
    products for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing
    strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product
    implementations. These practices could, over time, significantly
    constrain the prices that we can charge for our products. If we
    cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in
    the number of sales or with lower spending, then the reduced
    license revenues resulting from lower prices could have an
    adverse effect on our results of operations.

We have
    acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses
    and may not realize the expected benefits of these
    acquisitions.

We have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and
    businesses in the future. While we expect to carefully analyze
    each potential acquisition before committing to the transaction,
    we may not consummate any particular transaction, but may
    nonetheless incur significant costs, or if a transaction is
    consummated, we may not be able to integrate and manage acquired
    products and businesses effectively. In addition, acquisitions
    involve a number of risks. If any of the following events occurs
    when we acquire another business, it could seriously harm our
    business, operating results or financial condition:

•

Difficulties in combining previously separate businesses into a
    single unit;

•

The substantial diversion of management’s attention from

day-to-day

business when evaluating and negotiating these transactions and
    integrating an acquired business;

•

The discovery, after completion of the acquisition, of
    unanticipated liabilities assumed from the acquired business or
    of assets acquired, such that we cannot realize the anticipated
    value of the acquisition;

•

The failure to realize anticipated benefits such as cost savings
    and revenue enhancements;

•

The failure to retain key employees of the acquired business;

•

Difficulties related to integrating the products of an acquired
    business in, for example, distribution, engineering and customer
    support areas;

•

Unanticipated costs;

•

Customer dissatisfaction with existing license agreements with
    us, possibly dissuading them from licensing or buying products
    acquired by us after the effective date of the license; and

•

The failure to understand and compete effectively in markets
    where we have limited experience.

In a number of our previously completed acquisitions, we have
    agreed to make future payments, either in the form of employee
    bonuses or contingent purchase price payments based on the
    performance of the acquired businesses or the employees who
    joined us with the acquired businesses. We may continue to use
    contingent purchase price payments in connection with
    acquisitions in the future. The performance goals pursuant to
    which these future payments may be made generally relate to
    achievement by the acquired business or the employees who joined
    us with the acquired business of certain specified orders,
    revenue, run rate, product proliferation, product development or
    employee retention goals during a specified period following
    completion of the applicable acquisition. Future acquisitions
    may involve issuances of stock as full or partial payment of the
    purchase price for the acquired business, grants of incentive
    stock or options to employees of the acquired businesses (which
    may be dilutive to existing stockholders), expenditure of
    substantial cash resources or the incurrence of material amounts
    of debt.



The specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of
    employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments vary with
    each acquisition. While we expect to derive value from an
    acquisition in excess of such contingent payment obligations,
    our strategy may change and we may be required to make certain
    contingent payments without deriving the anticipated value.

We rely
    on our proprietary technology, as well as software and other
    intellectual property rights licensed to us by third parties,
    and we cannot assure you that the precautions taken to protect
    our rights will be adequate or that we will continue to be able
    to adequately secure such intellectual property rights from
    third parties.

Our success depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology.
    We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade
    secret laws, licenses and restrictive agreements to establish
    and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products.
    Despite the precautions we may take to protect our intellectual
    property, third parties have tried in the past, and may try in
    the future, to challenge, invalidate or circumvent these
    safeguards. The rights granted under our patents or attendant to
    our other intellectual property may not provide us with any
    competitive advantages. Patents may not be issued on any of our
    pending applications and our issued patents may not be
    sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Furthermore, the
    laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights
    in those countries to the same extent as applicable law protects
    these rights in the United States. The protection of our
    intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant
    financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take
    to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect
    our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or
    misappropriating our proprietary rights.

Many of our products include software or other intellectual
    property licensed from third parties. We may have to seek new or
    renew existing licenses for such software and other intellectual
    property in the future. Our engineering services business holds
    licenses to certain software and other intellectual property
    owned by third parties, including that of our competitors. Our
    failure to obtain software or other intellectual property
    licenses or other intellectual property rights that is necessary
    or helpful for our business on favorable terms, or the need to
    engage in litigation over these licenses or rights, could
    seriously harm our business, operating results or financial
    condition.

We could
    lose key technology or suffer serious harm to our business
    because of the infringement of our intellectual property rights
    by third parties or because of our infringement of the
    intellectual property rights of third parties.

There are numerous EDA product-related patents. New patents are
    being issued at a rapid rate and are owned by EDA companies as
    well as entities and individuals outside the EDA industry. It is
    not always practicable to determine in advance whether a product
    or any of its components infringes the patent rights of others.
    As a result, from time to time, we may be compelled to respond
    to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to
    protect our rights or defend a customer’s rights.

Intellectual property infringement claims, including defense
    reimbursement obligations related to third party claims,
    regardless of merit, could consume valuable management time,
    result in costly litigation, or cause product shipment delays,
    all of which could seriously harm our business, operating
    results or financial condition. In settling these claims, we may
    be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with
    the third parties claiming infringement. These royalty or
    licensing agreements, if available, may not have terms favorable
    to us. Being compelled to enter into a license agreement with
    unfavorable terms could seriously harm our business, operating
    results or financial condition. Any potential intellectual
    property litigation could compel us to do one or more of the
    following:

•

Pay damages (including the potential for treble damages),
    license fees or royalties (including royalties for past periods)
    to the party claiming infringement;

•

Stop licensing products or providing services that use the
    challenged intellectual property;

•

Obtain a license from the owner of the infringed intellectual
    property to sell or use the relevant technology, which license
    may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all; or



•

Redesign the challenged technology, which could be
    time-consuming and costly, or not be accomplished.

If we were compelled to take any of these actions, our business
    or operating results may suffer.

If our
    security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains
    access to customer data, our information systems may be
    perceived as being unsecure and customers may curtail or stop
    their use of our products and services.

Our products and services involve the storage and transmission
    of customers’ proprietary information, and breaches of our
    security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of
    this information, litigation and potential liability. Because
    techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage
    information systems change frequently and generally are not
    recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to
    anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive
    measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security
    occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our
    security measures could be harmed and we could lose existing
    customers and our ability to obtain new customers.

The long
    sales cycle of our products and services makes the timing of our
    revenue difficult to predict and may cause our operating results
    to fluctuate unexpectedly.

Generally, we have a long sales cycle that can extend up to six
    months or longer. The complexity and expense associated with our
    products and services generally require a lengthy customer
    education, evaluation and approval process. Consequently, we may
    incur substantial expenses and devote significant management
    effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do
    not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent us from
    pursuing other opportunities.

In addition, sales of our products and services have been and
    may in the future be delayed if customers delay approval or
    commencement of projects because of:

•

The timing of customers’ competitive evaluation
    processes; or

•

Customers’ budgetary constraints and budget cycles.

Long sales cycles for acceleration and emulation hardware
    products subject us to a number of significant risks over which
    we have limited control, including insufficient, excess or
    obsolete inventory, variations in inventory valuation and
    fluctuations in quarterly operating results.

Our
    reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes
    in United States generally accepted accounting
    principles.

United States generally accepted accounting principles are
    subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards
    Board, or FASB, the American Institute of Certified Public
    Accountants, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and
    interpret appropriate accounting principles. During fiscal 2010,
    the FASB issued exposure drafts of proposed accounting
    principles related to revenue recognition and leases which could
    change the way we account for certain of our transactions. A
    change in these or other principles or interpretations could
    have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and
    could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the
    announcement of a change. In addition, the SEC announced a
    multi-year plan that could ultimately lead to the use of
    International Financial Reporting Standards by United States
    issuers in their SEC filings. Any such change could have a
    significant effect on our reported financial results.

The
    effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other risks to
    our international operations may seriously harm our financial
    condition.

We have significant operations outside the United States. Our
    revenue from international operations as a percentage of total
    revenue was approximately 59% during fiscal 2010, 57% during
    fiscal 2009 and 58% during fiscal 2008, a substantial portion of
    which is denominated in United States dollars. We expect that
    revenue from our international operations will continue to
    account for a significant portion of our total revenue. We also
    transact business in various foreign currencies, primarily the
    Japanese yen. The volatility of foreign currencies in certain



regions, most notably the Japanese yen, European Union euro,
    British pound and Indian rupee have had and may in the future
    have an effect on our revenue or operating results.

Fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the United States
    dollar and the currencies of other countries where we conduct
    business could seriously affect our business, operating results
    or financial condition. For example, when a foreign currency
    declines in value relative to the United States dollar, it takes
    more of the foreign currency to purchase the same amount of
    United States dollars than before the change. If we price our
    products and services in the foreign currency, we receive fewer
    United States dollars than we did before the change. If we price
    our products and services in United States dollars, the decrease
    in value of the local currency results in an increase in the
    price for our products and services compared to those products
    of our competitors that are priced in local currency. This could
    result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where
    business is transacted in the local currency. On the other hand,
    when a foreign currency increases in value relative to the
    United States dollar, it takes more United States dollars to
    purchase the same amount of the foreign currency. As we use the
    foreign currency to pay for payroll costs and other operating
    expenses in our international operations, this results in an
    increase in operating expenses.

Exposure to foreign currency transaction risk can arise when
    transactions are conducted in a currency different from the
    functional currency of one of our subsidiaries. A
    subsidiary’s functional currency is generally the currency
    in which it primarily conducts its operations, including product
    pricing, expenses and borrowings. Although we attempt to reduce
    the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, significant
    exchange rate movements may hurt our results of operations as
    expressed in United States dollars.

Our international operations may also be subject to other risks,
    including:

•

The adoption or expansion of government trade restrictions,
    including tariffs and other trade barriers;

•

Limitations on repatriation of earnings;

•

Limitations on the conversion of foreign currencies;

•

Reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some
    countries;

•

Recessions in foreign economies;

•

Longer collection periods for receivables and greater difficulty
    in collecting accounts receivable;

•

Difficulties in managing foreign operations;

•

Compliance with United States and foreign laws and regulations
    applicable to our worldwide operations;

•

Political and economic instability;

•

Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and

•

United States and other governments’ licensing requirements
    for exports, which may lengthen the sales cycle or restrict or
    prohibit the sale or licensing of certain products.

We have offices throughout the world, including key research and
    development facilities outside of the United States. Our
    operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations
    throughout the world. Activities that interfere with our
    international connectivity, such as computer hacking or the
    introduction of a virus into our computer systems, could
    significantly interfere with our business operations.

We have
    substantial cash requirements in the United States, but a
    significant portion of our cash is held and generated outside of
    the United States, and if our cash available in the United
    States is insufficient to meet our operating expenses and debt
    repayment obligations in the United States, then we may be
    required to raise cash in ways that could negatively affect our
    financial condition, results of operations and the market price
    of our common stock.

We have significant operations outside the United States. As of
    January 1, 2011, approximately one third of our Cash and
    cash equivalents balance was held in accounts in the United
    States, with the remainder of the balance held in accounts
    outside of the United States. We believe that the combination of
    our existing United States cash balances and future United
    States operating cash flows are sufficient to meet our ongoing
    United States operating expenses and debt repayment obligations.
    However, if these sources of cash are insufficient to meet our
    future funding obligations in the United States, we could be
    required to seek other available funding sources which could
    negatively impact our results of operations, financial position
    and the market price of our common stock.



Our
    operating results could be adversely affected as a result of
    changes in our effective tax rates.

Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by
    the following:

•

Changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws,
    including potential United States and international tax reforms;

•

Earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we are
    taxed at lower rates as compared to the United States federal
    and state statutory tax rates;

•

An increase in expenses not deductible for tax purposes,
    including certain stock-based compensation and impairment of
    goodwill;

•

Changes in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax
    assets;

•

Changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information that
    results in a recognition, derecognition, or change in
    measurement of a tax position taken in a prior period;

•

Increases to interest or penalty expenses classified in the
    financial statements as income taxes;

•

New accounting standards or interpretations of such standards;

•

A change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign
    earnings outside the United States; or

•

Results of tax examinations by the Internal Revenue Service, or
    IRS and state and foreign tax authorities.

Any significant change in our future effective tax rates could
    adversely impact our results of operations for future periods.

We have
    received examination reports from the IRS proposing deficiencies
    in certain of our tax returns, and the outcome of current and
    future tax examinations may have a material adverse effect on
    our results of operations and cash flows.

The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine our income
    tax returns, and the IRS is currently examining our federal
    income tax returns for the tax years 2006 through 2008.

In July 2006, the IRS completed its field examination of our
    federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002
    and issued a Revenue Agent’s Report, or RAR in which the
    IRS proposed to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the
    three-year period of approximately $324.0 million. In
    November 2006, the IRS revised the proposed aggregate tax
    deficiency for the three-year period to be approximately
    $318.0 million. In October 2010, the Appeals Office of the
    IRS, or the Appeals Office, provided us with copies of the
    settlement agreements executed by the Appeals Office in August
    2010 that resolved the previously disputed 2000 through 2002 tax
    positions. While we did not receive the final IRS determination
    of the amount of tax and interest that we owe prior to
    January 1, 2011, we consider the tax positions to be
    effectively settled, because the IRS has completed its
    examination procedures and we believe that there is a remote
    possibility that the IRS will re-examine the settled tax
    positions.

In May 2009, the IRS completed its field examination of our
    federal income tax returns for the tax years 2003 through 2005
    and issued a RAR, in which the IRS proposed to assess an
    aggregate deficiency for the three-year period of approximately
    $94.1 million. In August 2009, the IRS reduced the proposed
    aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period to
    approximately $60.7 million. The IRS is contesting our
    transfer pricing arrangements with our foreign subsidiaries and
    deductions for foreign trade income. The IRS made similar claims
    against our transfer pricing arrangements and deductions for
    foreign trade income in prior examinations and may make similar
    claims in its examinations of other tax years. We have filed a
    timely protest with the IRS and are seeking resolution of the
    issues through the Appeals Office. We believe that the proposed
    IRS adjustments for the tax years 2003 through 2005 are
    inconsistent with applicable tax laws and we are vigorously
    challenging these proposed adjustments, although there can be no
    assurance that we will prevail.

The RARs are not final Statutory Notices of Deficiency, but the
    IRS imposes interest on the proposed deficiencies until the
    matters are resolved. Interest is compounded daily at rates
    published and adjusted quarterly by the IRS and have been
    between 4% and 10% since 2001.

The calculation of our provision (benefit) for income taxes
    requires us to use significant judgment and involves dealing
    with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and
    regulations. In determining the adequacy of our provision
    (benefit) for income taxes, we regularly assess the potential
    settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations.
    However, the final outcome of tax examinations, including the
    total amount payable or



the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues,
    cannot be estimated with certainty. In addition, we cannot be
    certain that such amount will not be materially different from
    the amount that is reflected in our historical income tax
    provisions and accruals. Should the IRS or other tax authorities
    assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future
    examination, including the examination of the tax years 2000
    through 2002 that we consider to be effectively settled, we may
    be required to record charges to operations in future periods
    that could have a material impact on the results of operations,
    financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or
    periods.

Forecasting
    our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject
    to uncertainty, and material differences between forecasted and
    actual tax rates could have a material impact on our results of
    operations.

Forecasts of our income tax position and resultant effective tax
    rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income
    tax position for each year combines the effects of estimating
    our annual income or loss, the mix of profits and losses earned
    by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad
    range of income tax rates, as well as benefits from available
    deferred tax assets, the impact of various accounting rules and
    changes to these rules and results of tax audits. To forecast
    our global tax rate, pre-tax profits and losses by jurisdiction
    are estimated and tax expense by jurisdiction is calculated
    based on such estimates. Forecasts of annual income or loss that
    are near break-even, as we expect for fiscal 2011, will cause
    our estimated annual effective tax rate to be particularly
    sensitive to any changes to our estimates of tax expense. If our
    estimate of the pre-tax profit and losses, the mix of our
    profits and losses, our ability to use deferred tax assets, the
    results of tax audits, or effective tax rates by jurisdiction is
    different than those estimates, our actual tax rate could be
    materially different than forecasted, which could have a
    material impact on our results of operations.

We depend
    on a sole supplier for certain hardware components, making us
    vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuation.

We are dependent on a sole supplier for certain hardware
    components. Our reliance on a sole supplier could result in
    product delivery problems, reduced control over product pricing
    and quality, and limit our ability to identify and qualify
    another supplier in a timely manner. While it is our goal to
    have multiple sources to procure certain key components, in some
    cases it is not practical or feasible to do so. We may suffer a
    disruption in the supply of certain hardware components if we
    are unable to purchase sufficient components on a timely basis
    or at all for any reason.

Our
    operating results and revenue could be adversely affected by
    customer payment delays, customer bankruptcies and defaults or
    modifications of licenses or supplier modifications.

As a result of the challenging economic environment in fiscal
    2008 and 2009, our customers, who are primarily concentrated in
    the semiconductor sector, experienced adverse changes in their
    business, and certain customers delayed or defaulted on their
    payment obligations to us. If our customers experience
    difficulties in the future, they may delay or default on their
    payment obligations to us, file for bankruptcy or modify or
    cancel plans to license our products, and our suppliers may
    significantly and quickly increase their prices or reduce their
    output. If our customers are not successful in generating
    sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing, they
    may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts
    receivable that are owed to us, although these obligations are
    generally not cancelable. Our customers’ inability to
    fulfill payment obligations may adversely affect our revenue and
    cash flow. Additionally, our customers may seek to renegotiate
    pre-existing contractual commitments. Payment defaults by our
    customers or significant reductions in existing contractual
    commitments could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition and operating results. Because of the
    relatively high levels of volatility that continue to drive
    significant fluctuations in asset prices, as well as escalating
    concern regarding high levels of leverage in sovereign and
    corporate debt, the capital and credit markets are volatile and
    increasingly unpredictable in this environment. If we were to
    seek funding from the capital or credit markets in response to
    any material level of customer defaults, we may not be able to
    secure funding on terms acceptable to us or at all, which, may
    have a material negative effect on our business.



We may
    not be able to effectively implement our restructuring plans,
    and our restructuring plans may not result in the benefits we
    have anticipated, possibly having a negative effect on our
    future operating results.

During fiscal 2008, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010, we initiated
    restructuring plans in an effort to decrease costs by reducing
    our workforce and by consolidating facilities. We may not be
    able to successfully complete and realize the expected benefits
    of our restructuring plans, such as improvements in operating
    margins and cash flows, in the restructuring periods
    contemplated. The restructuring plans have involved and may
    continue to involve higher costs or a longer timetable than we
    currently anticipate or may fail to improve our operating
    results as we anticipate. Our inability to realize these
    benefits may result in an inefficient business structure that
    could negatively affect our results of operations. Our
    restructuring plans have caused us and will cause us to incur
    substantial costs related to severance and other
    employee-related costs. Our restructuring plans may also subject
    us to litigation risks and expenses. In addition, our
    restructuring plans may have other consequences, such as
    attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce, a negative
    effect on employee morale or our ability to attract highly
    skilled employees, and our competitors may seek to gain a
    competitive advantage over us. The restructuring plans could
    also cause our remaining employees to leave or result in reduced
    productivity by our employees, and, in turn, this may affect our
    revenue and other operating results in the future.

Failure
    to obtain export licenses could harm our business by rendering
    us unable to ship products and transfer our technology outside
    of the United States.

We must comply with regulations of the United States and of
    certain other countries in shipping our software products and
    transferring our technology outside the United States and to
    foreign nationals. Any significant future difficulty in
    complying could harm our business, operating results or
    financial condition.

Errors or
    defects in our products and services could expose us to
    liability and harm our reputation.

Our customers use our products and services in designing and
    developing products that involve a high degree of technological
    complexity, each of which has its own specifications. Because of
    the complexity of the systems and products with which we work,
    some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only
    when put to full use in the marketplace. As a result, our
    customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in
    our software or the systems we design, or the products or
    systems incorporating our design and intellectual property may
    not operate as expected. Errors or defects could result in:

•

Loss of customers;

•

Loss of market segment share;

•

Failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance;

•

Diversion of development resources to resolve the problem;

•

Loss of or delay in revenue;

•

Increased service costs; and

•

Liability for damages.

If we
    become subject to unfair hiring claims, we could be prevented
    from hiring needed employees, incur liability for damages and
    incur substantial costs in defending ourselves.

Companies in our industry that lose employees to competitors
    frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair
    hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would
    involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets. These claims
    could prevent us from hiring employees or cause us to incur
    liability for damages. We could also incur substantial costs in
    defending ourselves or our employees against these claims,
    regardless of their merits. Defending ourselves from these
    claims could also divert the attention of our management away
    from our operations.



Anti-takeover
    defenses in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and
    certain provisions under Delaware law could prevent an
    acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors
    might be willing to pay for our common stock.

Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain
    provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law that apply to
    us could make it difficult for another company to acquire
    control of our company. For example:

•

Our certificate of incorporation allows our Board of Directors
    to issue, at any time and without stockholder approval,
    preferred stock with such terms as it may determine. No shares
    of preferred stock are currently outstanding. However, the
    rights of holders of any of our preferred stock that may be
    issued in the future may be superior to the rights of holders of
    our common stock.

•

Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
    generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any
    business combination with a person owning 15% or more of its
    voting stock, or who is affiliated with the corporation and
    owned 15% or more of its voting stock at any time within three
    years prior to the proposed business combination, for a period
    of three years from the date the person became a 15% owner,
    unless specified conditions are met.

All or any one of these factors could limit the price that
    certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of our
    common stock and could allow our Board of Directors to resist,
    delay or prevent an acquisition of our company, even if a
    proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our
    independent stockholders.

Our
    business is subject to the risk of earthquakes.

Our corporate headquarters, including certain of our research
    and development operations and certain of our distribution
    facilities, is located in the Silicon Valley area of Northern
    California, a region known to experience seismic activity. If
    significant seismic activity were to occur, our operations may
    be interrupted, which could adversely impact our business and
    results of operations.

We
    maintain research and development and other facilities in parts
    of the world that are not as politically stable as the United
    States, and as a result we may face a higher risk of business
    interruption from acts of war, political unrest or terrorism
    than businesses located only or primarily in the United
    States.

We maintain international research and development and other
    facilities, some of which are in parts of the world that are not
    as politically stable as the United States. Consequently, we may
    face a greater risk of business interruption as a result of
    terrorist acts or military conflicts than businesses located
    domestically. Furthermore, this potential harm is exacerbated
    given that damage to or disruptions at our international
    research and development facilities could have an adverse effect
    on our ability to develop new or improve existing products as
    compared to other businesses which may only have sales offices
    or other less critical operations abroad. We are not insured for
    losses or interruptions caused by acts of war.

Risks
    Related to Our Securities and Indebtedness

Our debt
    obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our
    business, operating results or financial condition, and could
    prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such
    indebtedness.

We have a substantial level of debt. As of January 1, 2011,
    we had outstanding indebtedness with a principal balance of
    $644.7 million as follows:

•

$350.0 million related to our 2.625% Cash Convertible
    Senior Notes Due 2015, or the 2015 Notes;

•

$150.0 million related to our 1.375% Convertible
    Senior Notes Due December 2011, or the 2011 Notes;

•

$144.5 million related to our 1.500% Convertible
    Senior Notes Due December 2013, or the 2013 Notes and, together
    with the 2011 Notes, the Convertible Senior Notes; and

•

$0.2 million related to our Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior
    Convertible Notes Due 2023, or the 2023 Notes.



The level of our current or future indebtedness, among other
    things, could:

•

Make it difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations on
    our debt as described above;

•

Make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our
    business;

•

Reduce funds available for use in our operations or for
    developments or acquisitions of new technologies;

•

Make it difficult for us to incur additional debt or obtain any
    necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital
    expenditures, debt service, acquisitions or general corporate
    purposes;

•

Impose operating or financial covenants on us;

•

Limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in
    our business; or

•

Place us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to less
    leveraged competitors and competitors that have greater access
    to capital resources.

If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise
    obtain funds necessary to make required payments, or if we fail
    to comply with the various requirements of our indebtedness, we
    would be in default, which would permit the holders of our
    indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness and
    could cause defaults under any other indebtedness as well.

Any default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, operating results and financial
    condition. In addition, a material default on our indebtedness
    could suspend our eligibility to register securities using
    certain registration statement forms under SEC guidelines that
    permit incorporation by reference of substantial information
    regarding us and potentially hindering our ability to raise
    capital through the issuance of our securities and will increase
    the costs of such registration to us.

On the first day of fiscal 2009, we retrospectively adopted new
    accounting principles as required by the “Debt with
    Conversion and Other Options” subtopic of the FASB
    Accounting Standards Codification, and adjusted all periods for
    which the Convertible Senior Notes were outstanding before the
    date of adoption. This adoption had an adverse effect on our
    operating results and financial condition, particularly with
    respect to interest expense ratios commonly referred to by
    lenders, and could potentially hinder our ability to raise
    capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities.

Conversion
    of our Convertible Senior Notes and 2015 Notes into cash prior
    to the scheduled maturities of the notes may adversely affect
    our liquidity and financial condition.

Holders of our Convertible Senior Notes and 2015 Notes may
    convert their notes into cash prior to the scheduled maturities
    of the notes upon the occurrence of certain events. If one or
    more note holders elect to convert their notes upon the
    occurrence of any of these certain events, we would be required
    to settle the converted principal through payment of cash, which
    could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. In
    addition, even if note holders do not elect to convert their
    notes upon the occurrence of any of these certain events, we
    would report any of our Convertible Senior Notes or 2015 Notes
    that are convertible at a balance sheet date as a current
    liability, which could have a material adverse impact on our net
    working capital. For an additional description of our
    Convertible Senior Notes and 2015 Notes, see Note 3 to our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Conversion
    of the Convertible Senior Notes and the exercise of warrants
    issued concurrently with the Convertible Senior Notes and 2015
    Notes will, in certain circumstances, dilute the ownership
    interests of existing stockholders.

The terms of the Convertible Senior Notes permit the holders to
    convert the Convertible Senior Notes into shares of our common
    stock. The terms of the Convertible Senior Notes stipulate a net
    share settlement, which upon conversion of the Convertible
    Senior Notes requires us to pay the principal amount in cash and
    the conversion premium, if any, in shares of our common stock
    based on a daily settlement amount, calculated on a
    proportionate basis for each day of the relevant 20

trading-day

observation period. The initial conversion rate for the
    Convertible Senior Notes is 47.2813 shares of our common
    stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes,
    equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $21.15 per
    share of our common stock. The conversion price is subject to
    adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued
    interest, except in limited circumstances. The conversion of
    some or all of the Convertible Senior Notes will dilute the
    ownership interest of our existing



stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock
    issuable upon conversion could adversely affect prevailing
    market prices of our common stock.

Each $1,000 of principal of the Convertible Senior Notes is
    initially convertible into 47.2813 shares of our common
    stock, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified
    events. Holders of the Convertible Senior Notes may convert
    their notes at their option on any day before the close of
    business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding
    December 15, 2011 in the case of the 2011 Notes and
    December 15, 2013 in the case of the 2013 Notes, in each
    case only if:

•

The price of our common stock reaches $27.50 during certain
    periods of time specified in the Convertible Senior Notes;

•

Specified corporate transactions occur; or

•

The trading price of the Convertible Senior Notes falls below
    98% of the product of (i) the last reported sale price of
    our common stock and (ii) the conversion rate on that date.

From November 2, 2011, in the case of the 2011 Notes, and
    November 1, 2013, in the case of the 2013 Notes, and until
    the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately
    preceding the maturity date of such Convertible Senior Notes,
    holders may convert their Convertible Senior Notes at any time,
    regardless of the foregoing circumstances. As of January 1,
    2011, none of the conditions allowing holders of the Convertible
    Senior Notes to convert had been met.

Although the conversion price of the Convertible Senior Notes is
    $21.15 per share, we entered into separate hedge and warrant
    transactions concurrent with the issuance of the Convertible
    Senior Notes to reduce the potential dilution from the
    conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes.

Additionally, although the 2015 Notes are only convertible into
    cash, we entered into separate hedge and warrant transactions
    concurrent with the issuance of the 2015 Notes to reduce the
    potential cash outlay from the conversion of the 2015 Notes.
    However, we cannot guarantee that the hedge and warrant
    instruments issued concurrently with the Convertible Senior
    Notes will fully mitigate the potential dilution from the
    Convertible Senior Notes or that the warrants issued
    concurrently with the 2015 Notes will not result in dilution.
    The warrants could have a dilutive effect to the extent that the
    market price per share of our common stock, as measured under
    the terms of the warrants, exceeds the strike price of the
    warrants. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Senior
    Notes and the 2015 Notes may encourage short selling by market
    participants because the conversion of the Convertible Senior
    Notes could depress the price of our common stock.

At the
    option of the holders of the Convertible Senior Notes and the
    2015 Notes, under certain circumstances we may be required to
    repurchase the Convertible Senior Notes or the 2015 Notes in
    cash.

Under the terms of the Convertible Senior Notes and the 2015
    Notes, we may be required to repurchase the Convertible Senior
    Notes and the 2015 Notes following a “fundamental
    change” in our corporate ownership or structure, such as a
    change of control in which substantially all of the
    consideration does not consist of publicly traded securities,
    prior to maturity of the Convertible Senior Notes and the 2015
    Notes. The repurchase price for the Convertible Senior Notes and
    the 2015 Notes in the event of a fundamental change must be paid
    solely in cash. This repayment obligation may have the effect of
    discouraging, delaying or preventing a takeover of our company
    that may otherwise be beneficial to investors.

Hedge and
    warrant transactions entered into in connection with the
    issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes and the 2015 Notes may
    affect the value of our common stock.

We entered into hedge transactions with various financial
    institutions, at the time of issuance of the Convertible Senior
    Notes and the 2015 Notes, with the objective of reducing the
    potential dilutive effect of issuing our common stock upon
    conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes and the potential
    cash outlay from the cash conversion of the 2015 Notes. We also
    entered into separate warrant transactions with the same
    financial institutions. In connection with our hedge and warrant
    transactions associated with the Convertible Senior Notes and
    the 2015 Notes, these financial institutions purchased our
    common stock in secondary market transactions and entered into
    various



over-the-counter

derivative transactions with respect to our common stock. These
    entities or their affiliates are likely to modify their hedge
    positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of
    the Convertible Senior Notes and the 2015 Notes by purchasing
    and selling shares of our common stock, other of our securities
    or other instruments they may wish to use in connection with
    such hedging. Any of these transactions and activities could
    adversely affect the value of our common stock and, as a result,
    the number of shares and the value of the common stock that
    Convertible Senior Notes holders will receive upon conversion of
    the Convertible Senior Notes and the amount of cash that 2015
    Notes holders will receive upon conversion of the 2015 Notes. In
    addition, subject to movement in the price of our common stock,
    if the hedge transactions settle in our favor, we could be
    exposed to credit risk related to the other party with respect
    to the payment we are owed from such other party. If the
    financial institutions with which we entered into these hedge
    transactions were to fail or default, our ability to settle on
    these transactions could be harmed or delayed.

We are
    subject to the risk that the hedge participants cannot, or do
    not, fulfill their obligations under the Convertible Senior
    Notes hedge transactions and the 2015 Notes hedge
    transactions.

Global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or
    perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial
    institutions. If any of the participants in the hedge
    transactions is unwilling or unable to perform its obligations
    for any reason, we would not be able to receive the benefit of
    such transaction. We cannot provide any assurances as to the
    financial stability or viability of any of the participants in
    the hedge transactions.

Rating
    agencies may provide unsolicited ratings on the Convertible
    Senior Notes and the 2015 Notes that could reduce the market
    value or liquidity of our Convertible Senior Notes, 2015 Notes
    or our common stock.

We have not requested a rating of the Convertible Senior Notes
    or the 2015 Notes from any rating agency and we do not
    anticipate that the Convertible Senior Notes or the 2015 Notes
    will be rated. However, if one or more rating agencies
    independently elects to rate the Convertible Senior Notes or the
    2015 Notes and assigns the Convertible Senior Notes or the 2015
    Notes a rating lower than the rating expected by investors, or
    reduces such rating in the future, the market price or liquidity
    of the Convertible Senior Notes or the 2015 Notes, as the case
    may be, and our common stock could be harmed. Should a decline
    in the market price of the Convertible Senior Notes or the 2015
    Notes result, as compared to the price of our common stock, this
    may trigger the right of the holders of the Convertible Senior
    Notes or the 2015 Notes to convert such notes into cash and
    shares of our common stock, as applicable.

    Properties

We own land and buildings at our headquarters located in
    San Jose, California. We also own buildings in India. As of
    January 1, 2011, the total square footage of our owned
    buildings was approximately 965,000.

We lease additional facilities in the United States and various
    other countries. We sublease certain of these facilities where
    space is not fully utilized or has been impacted as part of our
    restructuring plans.

We believe that these facilities, including our newly
    constructed building located at our headquarters, are adequate
    for our current needs and that suitable additional or substitute
    space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion
    of our operations.

Item 3.
    Legal Proceedings

From time to time, we are involved in various disputes and
    litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business. These
    include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property,
    indemnification obligations, mergers and acquisitions,
    licensing, contracts, distribution arrangements and employee
    relations matters. At least quarterly, we review the status of
    each significant matter and assess our potential financial
    exposure. If the potential loss from



any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the
    amount or the range of loss can be estimated, we accrue a
    liability for the estimated loss. Legal proceedings are subject
    to uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to predict.
    Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based on our
    judgments using the best information available at the time. As
    additional information becomes available, we reassess the
    potential liability related to pending claims and litigation
    matters and may revise our estimates.

On February 8, 2011 and February 11, 2011, we agreed
    to settle our pending derivative and securities litigation,
    respectively, subject to completion of final settlement
    documentation by the parties and court approval. Accordingly, we
    recorded Litigation charges of $15.8 million in fiscal
    2010. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements
    for an additional description of our legal proceedings and this
    settlement.

    benefit for income taxes due to the release of the deferred tax
    asset valuation allowance primarily resulting from the increase
    in deferred tax liabilities from the intangible assets acquired
    with our acquisition of Denali. For an additional description

Item 7.
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with
    the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included
    elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and with Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Please refer to
    the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K

regarding forward-looking statements.

Business
    Overview

We develop EDA software, hardware, and silicon IP. We license
    software and IP, sell or lease hardware technology, provide
    maintenance for our software, IP and hardware and provide
    engineering and education services throughout the world to help
    manage and accelerate product development processes for
    electronics. Our customers use our products and services to
    design and develop complex ICs and electronics systems. During
    fiscal 2010, we had orders of $956 million.

We primarily generate revenue from licensing our EDA software
    and IP, selling or leasing our hardware technology, providing
    maintenance for our products and providing engineering services.
    Substantially all of our revenue is generated from IC and
    electronics systems manufacturers and designers and is dependent
    upon their commencement of new design projects. As a result, our
    revenue is significantly influenced by our customers’
    business outlook and investment in the introduction of new
    products and the improvement of existing products.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates

In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we make
    assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant
    impact on our revenue, operating income (loss) and net income
    (loss), as well as on the value of certain assets and
    liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We base our
    assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience
    and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under
    the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from
    these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. At
    least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and
    estimates and make changes accordingly. Historically, our
    assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical
    accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual
    results. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and
    estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition,
    accounting for income taxes, allowance for doubtful accounts,
    valuation of intangible assets, valuation of goodwill and fair
    value have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated
    Financial Statements; therefore, we consider these to be our
    critical accounting estimates. For information on our
    significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue
    Recognition

We begin to recognize revenue from licensing and supporting our
    software, IP and hardware products when all of the following
    criteria are met:

•

We have persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer;

•

Delivery of all specified products has occurred;

•

The fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or
    determinable, at the outset of the arrangement; and

•

Collectibility of the fee is probable.

Significant judgment is involved in the determination of whether
    the facts and circumstances of an arrangement support that the
    fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or
    determinable and that collectibility of the fee is probable, and
    these judgments can affect the amount of revenue that we
    recognize in a particular reporting period. We must also make
    these judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment to a
    term arrangement (primarily in the context of a license
    extension or renewal) constitutes a concession. Our experience
    has been that we are able to determine whether a fee is fixed or
    determinable for term licenses and we have established a history
    of collecting under the original contract without providing
    concessions on payments, products or services.



For installment contracts that do not include a substantial
    up-front payment, we consider that a fee is fixed or
    determinable only if the arrangement has payment periods that
    are equal to or less than the term of the licenses and the
    payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments,
    when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement. While we
    do not expect that experience to change, if we no longer were to
    have a history of collecting under the original contract without
    providing concessions on term licenses, revenue from term
    licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under
    the installment contract become due and payable. Such a change
    could have a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations.

Our experience has been that we are generally able to estimate
    whether collection is probable. Significant judgment is applied
    as we assess the creditworthiness of our customers to make this
    determination. If our experience were to change, such a change
    could have a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations. If, in our judgment, collection of a fee is not
    probable, we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed,
    which generally means revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash
    payment from the customer.

A multiple element arrangement, or MEA, is any arrangement that
    includes or contemplates rights to a combination of software or
    hardware products, software license types, services, training or
    maintenance in a single arrangement. From time to time, we may
    include individual deliverables in separately priced and
    separately signed contracts with the same customer. We obtain
    and evaluate all known relevant facts and circumstances in
    determining whether the separate contracts should be accounted
    for individually as distinct arrangements or whether the
    separate contracts are, in substance, a MEA. Significant
    judgment can be involved in determining whether a group of
    contracts might be so closely related that they are, in effect,
    part of a single arrangement.

For our subscription licenses, including “eDA Platinum
    Cards,” the software license agreements typically combine
    the right to use specified software products, the right to
    maintenance, and the right to receive and use unspecified future
    software products for no additional fee, when and if available,
    during the term of the license agreement. Under these license
    agreements, when all four of the revenue recognition criteria
    outlined above are met, we recognize revenue ratably over the
    term of the license agreement beginning with delivery of the
    products. Subscription license revenue is allocated to product
    and maintenance revenue. The allocation to maintenance revenue
    is based on the average substantive renewal rates included in
    the sale of similar term license arrangements. In the event that
    the license fee for this type of arrangement is not considered
    to be fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement, we
    recognize revenue at the lesser of (i) the pro-rata portion
    of the license fee for the applicable period, or (ii) as
    payments from the customer become due (if all other conditions
    for revenue recognition have been satisfied).

For term and perpetual licenses, including “eDA Gold
    Cards,” that include a stated annual maintenance renewal
    rate, software license fees are recognized as revenue
    “up-front” when all four of the revenue recognition
    criteria outlined above are met, generally upon delivery, and
    the maintenance fees are recognized ratably over the term of the
    maintenance period. Under our current business model, a
    relatively small percentage of our revenue from software
    licenses is recognized on an up-front basis.

License agreements under which license fees are recognized
    up-front do not include the right to receive unspecified future
    products. However, when such license agreements are executed
    within close proximity or in contemplation of other license
    agreements that require ratable revenue recognition with the
    same customer, the licenses together may be deemed a MEA, in
    which event all such revenue is recognized over multiple periods.

Revenue from service contracts is recognized either on the time
    and materials method, as work is performed, or on the

percentage-of-completion

method. For contracts with fixed or

not-to-exceed

fees, we estimate on a monthly basis the percentage of
    completion based on the completion of milestones relating to the
    arrangement. We have a history of accurately estimating project
    status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of
    internal and external factors can affect our estimates,
    including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and
    specification and testing requirement changes. If different
    conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could
    not be made, then the use of the completed contract method would
    be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would
    be deferred until the project was completed. Such a change could
    have a material impact on our results of operations.



Accounting
    for Income Taxes

We provide for the effect of income taxes in our Consolidated
    Financial Statements using the asset and liability method. We
    also apply a two-step approach to determining the financial
    statement recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions.

Income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of
    taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and for
    deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax consequences of
    events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial
    statements or tax returns. We must make significant assumptions,
    judgments and estimates to determine our current provision
    (benefit) for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and
    liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against
    our deferred tax assets. Our judgments, assumptions and
    estimates relating to the current provision (benefit) for income
    taxes include the geographic mix and amount of income (loss),
    our interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of
    current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax
    authorities. Our judgments also include anticipating the tax
    positions we will take on tax returns before actually preparing
    and filing the tax returns. Changes in our business, tax laws or
    our interpretation of tax laws, and developments in current and
    future tax audits, could significantly impact the amounts
    provided for income taxes in our results of operations,
    financial position or cash flows.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
    estimated future tax consequences attributable to tax benefit
    carryforwards and to differences between the financial statement
    amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax
    basis. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for
    recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more
    likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
    assets will not be realized. To make this assessment, we take
    into account predictions of the amount and category of taxable
    income from various sources and all available positive and
    negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable
    income. The weight given to the potential effect of negative and
    positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the
    strength of the evidence can be objectively verified. For
    example, a company’s current year or previous year losses
    are given more weight than its future outlook. For the years
    ended January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010, we
    concluded that a significant valuation allowance was required
    based on our evaluation and weighting of the positive and
    negative evidence. If, in the future, we determine that these
    deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized, a
    release of all or part, of the related valuation allowance could
    result in a material income tax benefit in the period such
    determination is made. For an additional description of the
    valuation allowance, see Note 6 to our Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

We only recognize an income tax position in our financial
    statements that we judge is more likely than not to be sustained
    solely on its technical merits in a tax audit, including
    resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. To
    make this judgment, we must interpret complex and sometimes
    ambiguous tax laws, regulations and administrative practices. If
    an income tax position meets the more likely than not
    recognition threshold, then we must measure the amount of the
    tax benefit to be recognized by determining the largest amount
    of tax benefit that has a greater than a 50% likelihood of being
    realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that
    has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts. It is
    inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as
    this requires us to determine the probability of various
    possible settlement outcomes. To determine if a tax position is
    effectively settled, we must also estimate the likelihood that a
    taxing authority would review a tax position after a tax
    examination has otherwise been completed. We must also determine
    when it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized
    tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the
    12 months after each fiscal year-end. These judgments are
    difficult because a taxing authority may change its behavior as
    a result of our disclosures in our financial statements or for
    other reasons. We must reevaluate our income tax positions on a
    quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or
    circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues
    under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in
    recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax
    benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. In
    addition, we are required by the IRS to disclose uncertain tax
    positions taken on our federal tax return for fiscal 2010.

We are also required to assess whether the earnings of our
    foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested outside the
    United States. As of January 1, 2011, we had recognized a
    deferred tax liability of $5.2 million related to
    $8.6 million of earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries
    that are not considered indefinitely invested outside the United
    States. Changes in our actual or projected operating results,
    tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws, foreign



exchange rates and developments in current and future tax audits
    could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes
    in our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

We make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding
    receivables and provide allowances for a portion of receivables
    when collection becomes doubtful. This allowance is based on our
    assessment of the creditworthiness of our customers, historical
    experience and the overall economic climate of the industries
    that we serve. While we believe that our allowance for doubtful
    accounts is adequate, we continue to monitor customer liquidity
    and other economic conditions, which may result in changes to
    our estimates regarding our ability to collect from our
    customers. Changes in circumstances, such as an unexpected
    change in a customer’s ability to meet its financial
    obligation to us or a customer’s payment trends, are hard
    to predict and may require us to adjust our estimates of the
    recoverability of amounts due to us. These changes could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    operating results.

During fiscal 2009, we increased the allowance for doubtful
    accounts by $21.6 million as a result of our assessment of
    the increased risk of customer delays or defaults on payment
    obligations. As a result of receiving payments related to a
    portion of the outstanding receivables against which we had
    previously recorded allowances, we have decreased our allowance
    for doubtful accounts to $7.6 million as of January 1,
    2011, as compared to $23.7 million as of January 2,
    2010. Of the $7.6 million allowance for doubtful accounts
    as of January 1, 2011, $6.9 million relates to one
    customer whose outstanding gross accounts receivable balance is
    due in the first half of 2011. If we recover any portion of that
    $6.9 million, it will result in a reduction of our
    operating expenses.

Valuation
    of Intangible Assets

When we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to
    acquired tangible assets and liabilities and acquired
    identifiable intangible assets. Any residual purchase price is
    recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price
    requires us to make significant estimates in determining the
    fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities,
    especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates
    are based on information obtained from management of the
    acquired companies, our assessment of this information, and
    historical experience. These estimates can include, but are not
    limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate
    in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital,
    and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an
    asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and
    unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the
    purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the
    acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation
    that we have made. In addition, unanticipated events and
    circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity
    of such estimates, and if such events occur, we may be required
    to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed
    liabilities.

We assess the impairment of long-lived assets, including certain
    identifiable intangibles, whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover an
    asset’s carrying amount. In addition, we assess our
    long-lived assets for impairment if they are abandoned.

For long-lived assets to be held and used, including acquired
    intangibles, we initiate our review whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a
    long-lived asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an
    asset is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the
    expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from
    the use and eventual disposition of that asset, excluding future
    interest costs that would be recognized as an expense when
    incurred. Any impairment to be recognized is measured by the
    amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its
    fair market value. Significant management judgment is required
    in:

•

Identifying a triggering event that arises from a change in
    circumstances;

•

Forecasting future operating results; and

•

Estimating the proceeds from the disposition of long-lived or
    intangible assets.

In future periods, material impairment charges could be
    necessary should different conditions prevail or different
    judgments be made.



Valuation
    of Goodwill

Costs in excess of the fair value of tangible and other
    intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
    combination are recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized,
    but instead is tested for impairment at least annually. We
    evaluate goodwill on an annual basis and whenever events and
    changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may
    not be recoverable.

Impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by
    comparing the reporting unit’s carrying amount, including
    goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair
    values of the reporting units are estimated using a combination
    of the income, or discounted cash flows, approach and the market
    approach, which utilizes comparable companies’ data. If the
    carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value,
    goodwill is considered to be impaired and a second step is
    performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss.

The preparation of the goodwill impairment analysis requires
    management to make significant estimates and assumptions with
    respect to the determination of fair values of the reporting
    unit and tangible and intangible assets. These estimates and
    assumptions, which include future values, are complex and often
    subjective and may differ significantly from period to period
    based on changes in the overall economic environment, changes in
    our industry and changes in our strategy or our internal
    forecasts. Estimates and assumptions with respect to the fair
    value determination include:

•

Control premium assigned to our market capitalization;

•

Our operating forecasts;

•

Revenue growth rates;

•

Risk-commensurate discount rates and costs of capital; and

•

Market multiples of revenue and earnings.

These estimates and assumptions, along with others, are used to
    estimate the fair value of our reporting unit as well as
    tangible and intangible assets. While we believe the estimates
    and assumptions we use are reasonable, different assumptions may
    materially impact the resulting fair value of the reporting
    unit, tangible assets and intangible assets, the amount of
    impairment we record in any given period and our results of
    operations.

We completed our annual goodwill impairment test during the
    third quarter of fiscal 2010 and determined that the fair value
    of our single reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying
    amount of our net assets and that no impairment existed.

Financial
    Instruments and Fair Value

Inputs to valuation techniques are observable or unobservable.
    Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent
    sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market
    assumptions. These two types of inputs have created the
    following fair-value hierarchy:

•

Level 1

– Quoted prices for identical
    instruments in active markets;

•

Level 2

– Quoted prices for similar
    instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or
    similar instruments in markets that are not active, and
    model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and
    significant value drivers are observable in active
    markets; and

•

Level 3

– Valuations derived from
    valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or
    significant value drivers are unobservable.

This hierarchy requires us to minimize the use of unobservable
    inputs and to use observable market data, if available, when
    determining fair value. We recognize transfers between levels of
    this hierarchy based on the fair values of the respective
    financial instruments at the end of the reporting period in
    which the transfer occurred. Changes in fair value are
    recognized in earnings each period for financial instruments
    that are carried at fair value.

The types of instruments that trade in markets that are not
    considered to be active, but are valued based on quoted market
    prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing
    sources with reasonable levels of price transparency, are
    generally classified within Level 2 of the fair value
    hierarchy.



In June 2010, we entered into hedge transactions, or the 2015
    Notes Hedges, and recorded an embedded conversion derivative, or
    the 2015 Notes Embedded Conversion Derivative, concurrent with
    the issuance of the 2015 Notes. The fair values of these
    derivatives are determined using an option pricing model based
    on observable inputs, such as implied volatility of our common
    stock, risk-free interest rate and other factors, and as such
    are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
    For an additional description of these transactions, see
    Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Certain instruments are classified within Level 3 of the
    fair value hierarchy because they trade infrequently and
    therefore have little or no price transparency. For those
    instruments that are not traded in active markets or are subject
    to transfer restrictions, valuations are adjusted to reflect
    illiquidity

and/or

non-transferability, and such adjustments are generally based on
    available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, our
    best estimate is used.

Results
    of Operations

Overview
    of Fiscal 2010

Financial results for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009
    and fiscal 2008, reflect the following:

•

Our customers remain cautious about making substantial new
    expenditures to purchase or lease EDA products or services
    despite growth in the semiconductor industry and some
    stabilization in the overall economic environment during 2010;

•

Increased revenue recognized because of higher business levels
    due to the timing of contract renewals with existing customers
    and from contracts executed in prior years due to our continued
    transition to a ratable license mix, which began in the third
    quarter of fiscal 2008;

•

A decrease in our bad debt expense due to the prior year
    increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts and the current
    year release of a portion of the reserve as a result of customer
    payments of certain receivables that were previously included in
    our allowance for doubtful accounts;

•

An increase in employee-related costs for commissions and other
    employee incentive compensation primarily resulting from
    improving business levels during fiscal 2010, as compared to
    fiscal 2009, partially offset by decreased costs as a result of
    our prior year restructuring plans and other expense reductions;

•

The acquisition of Denali including an increase in deferred tax
    liabilities from the intangible assets acquired with Denali and
    the resulting benefit for income taxes because of the release of
    valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets;

•

Effective settlement of the IRS examination of our federal
    income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002, which
    resulted in a benefit for income taxes of $147.9 million
    during fiscal 2010;

•

The issuance of $350.0 million principal amount of our 2015
    Notes, and the repurchase of $100.0 million principal
    amount of our 2011 Notes, and $105.5 million principal
    amount of our 2013 Notes; and

•

On February 8, 2011 and February 11, 2011, we agreed
    to settle our pending derivative and securities litigation,
    respectively. Accordingly, we recorded Litigation charges of
    $15.8 million in fiscal 2010.

Acquisition
    of Denali

In June 2010, we acquired Denali, a privately-held provider of
    electronic design automation software and intellectual property
    used in

system-on-chip

design and verification, for $296.8 million in cash. An
    additional $12.6 million of payments were deferred on the
    acquisition date and conditioned upon certain Denali
    shareholders remaining employees of Cadence during the periods
    specified in the respective agreements. As of January 1,
    2011, $10.5 million of the $12.6 million has been
    paid. During fiscal 2010, $10.2 million of the
    $12.6 million was expensed in our Consolidated Statements
    of Operations. The remaining $2.4 million will be expensed
    in our Consolidated Statements of Operations over the stated
    retention periods. The
    Denali

®

product portfolio includes memory models, design IP and
    verification IP. The impact of the Denali acquisition on our
    Statement of Operations in fiscal 2010 resulted in a greater
    increase in our operating expenses than the increase in revenue
    generated from the acquisition.



Revenue

We primarily generate revenue from licensing our EDA software
    and IP, selling or leasing our hardware technology, providing
    maintenance for our software, IP and hardware and providing
    engineering services. We principally use three license types:
    subscription, term and perpetual. The different license types
    provide a customer with different conditions of use for our
    products, such as:

•

The right to access new technology;

•

The duration of the license; and

•

Payment timing.

The timing of our product revenue is significantly affected by
    the mix of orders executed in any given period. For some orders,
    such as subscription orders, product and maintenance revenue is
    recognized ratably over multiple periods. In addition, depending
    on the individual facts and circumstances of a particular order,
    we have some orders for which product and maintenance revenue is
    recognized as payments become due and some for which revenue is
    only recognized when payment is received. For other orders, all
    product revenue is recognized up-front in the same quarter in
    which the order is executed.

We seek to achieve a mix of orders with approximately 90% of the
    total value of all executed orders consisting of orders for
    which the revenue is recurring, or ratable in nature, with the
    balance of the orders made up of orders for which the product
    revenue is recognized up-front. Our ability to achieve this
    ratable orders mix may be impacted by an increase in hardware
    sales beyond our current expectations. For an additional
    description of the impact of hardware sales on the anticipated
    mix of orders, see “New Accounting Standards” below.

During fiscal 2010, approximately 90% of the total value of our
    executed orders was comprised of ratable revenue orders.
    Approximately 90% of our fiscal 2010 revenue came from ratable
    orders.

Customer decisions regarding these aspects of license
    transactions determine the license type, timing of revenue
    recognition and potential future business activity. For example,
    if a customer chooses a fixed duration of use, this will result
    in either a subscription or term license. A business implication
    of this decision is that, at the expiration of the license
    period, the customer must decide whether to continue using the
    technology and therefore renew the license agreement.
    Historically, larger customers generally have used products from
    two or more of our five product groups and rarely completely
    terminated their relationship with us upon expiration of the
    license. See the discussion under the heading “Critical
    Accounting Estimates – Revenue Recognition” and
    Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional descriptions of license types and timing of revenue
    recognition.

Although we believe that pricing volatility has not generally
    been a material component of the change in our revenue from
    period to period, we believe that the amount of revenue
    recognized in future periods will depend on, among other things,
    the:

•

Competitiveness of our new technology;

•

Timing of contract renewals with existing customers;

•

Length of our sales cycle; and

•

Size, duration, terms and type of:

•

Contract renewals with existing customers;

•

Additional sales to existing customers; and

•

Sales to new customers.

The value and renewal of contracts, and consequently product
    revenue recognized, is affected by the competitiveness of our
    products. Product revenue recognized in any period is also
    affected by the extent to which customers purchase subscription,
    term or perpetual licenses, and the extent to which contracts
    contain flexible payment terms.

Revenue Mix



We analyze our software, IP and hardware businesses by product
    group, combining revenues for both product and maintenance
    because of their interrelationship. We have formulated a design
    solution strategy that combines our design technologies in
    “platforms,” as described in the various product
    groups below:

Functional Verification

:  Products in this
    group, including the Incisive functional verification platform
    are used to verify that the high level, logical representation
    of an IC design is functionally correct and for verification at
    the system and SoC levels. Our emulation hardware products,
    verification IP products, memory

sub-system

models, and silicon IP products are included in this product
    group, as are the products acquired through the Denali
    acquisition.

Digital IC Design

:  Products in this group,
    including the Encounter digital IC design platform, are used to
    create and convert the high-level, logical representation of a
    digital IC into a detailed physical blueprint and then detailed
    design information showing how the IC will be physically
    implemented. This data is used for creation of the photomasks
    used to manufacture semiconductors.

Custom IC Design

:  Our custom design products,
    including the Virtuoso custom design platform, are used for ICs
    that must be designed at the transistor level, including analog,
    RF, memory, high performance digital blocks and standard cell
    libraries. Included in this group are specialized verification
    products that simulate the operation of the design prior to
    manufacturing. Detailed design information showing how an IC
    will be physically implemented is used for creation of the
    photomasks used to manufacture semiconductors.

System Interconnect Design

:  This product group
    consists of our PCB and IC package design products, including
    the Allegro and
    OrCAD

®

products. The Allegro system interconnect design platform
    enables consistent co-design of interconnects across ICs, IC
    packages and PCBs, while the OrCAD line focuses on
    cost-effective, entry-level PCB solutions.

Design for Manufacturing

:  Included in this
    product group are our physical verification and analysis
    products. These products are used to analyze and verify that the
    physical blueprint of the IC has been constructed correctly and
    can be manufactured successfully. Our strategy includes focusing
    on integrating DFM awareness into our core design platforms of
    Encounter digital IC design and Virtuoso custom IC design.

For an additional description of our current product strategy,
    see the discussion under the heading “Products and Product
    Strategy” under Item 1, “Business.”

Product revenue increased during fiscal 2010, as compared to
    fiscal 2009, primarily because of higher business levels due to
    the timing of contract renewals with existing customers and from
    contracts executed in prior quarters due to our continued
    transition to a ratable license mix. We expect to recognize
    increased revenue during fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal
    2010, due to higher business levels and our continued transition
    to our more ratable license mix.

Product revenue decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared to
    fiscal 2008, primarily because of lower business levels due to
    the challenges in the macroeconomic environment, the timing of
    our contract renewals with existing customers, our transition to
    a ratable license mix and a longer sales cycle.



Services revenue decreased during fiscal 2010, as compared to
    fiscal 2009, primarily because of lower business levels in the
    services business. Services revenue decreased during fiscal
    2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, because of lower business
    levels due to the challenges in the macroeconomic environment
    and an increase in the proportion of arrangements for which
    revenue is deferred until payments become due and payable or
    cash is received from customers, primarily as a result of our
    assessment of the increased risk of customer delays or defaults
    on payment obligations.

Maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2010, as compared to
    2009, primarily because of higher business levels due to the
    timing of contract renewals with existing customers.

Maintenance revenue decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared to
    2008, due to lower business levels as a result of challenges in
    the macroeconomic environment, an increase in the proportion of
    arrangements for which revenue is deferred until payments become
    due and payable or cash is received from customers, primarily as
    a result of our assessment of the increased risk of customer
    delays or defaults on payment obligations and a decline in
    maintenance fees resulting from a reduction in the average
    duration of software license arrangements, because the annual
    fee for maintenance is lower for arrangements with shorter
    durations.

The following table shows the percentage of product and related
    maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product
    groups and Services and other during fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009
    and fiscal 2008:

As described in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial
    Statements, certain of our licensing arrangements allow
    customers the ability to remix among software products.
    Additionally, we have arrangements with customers that include a
    combination of our products with the actual product selection
    and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date.
    For these arrangements, we estimate the allocation of the
    revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our
    products. The actual usage of our products by these customers
    may differ and, if that proves to be the case, the revenue
    allocation in the table above would differ.

Although we believe the methodology of allocating revenue to
    product groups is reasonable, there can be no assurance that
    such allocated amounts reflect the amounts that would result had
    the customer individually licensed each specific software
    solution at the onset of the arrangement.

No single customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue
    during fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 or fiscal 2008.

Most of our revenue is transacted in the United States dollar.
    However, certain revenue transactions are in foreign currencies,
    primarily the Japanese yen, and we recognize additional revenue
    in periods when the United States dollar weakens in value
    against the Japanese yen and reduced revenue in periods when the
    United States dollar strengthens against the Japanese yen. For
    an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange
    rates affect our Consolidated Financial Statements, see the
    discussion under the heading “Item 7A. Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk –

    $26.6 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal
    2008, due to the following:

•

Newly granted restricted stock awards and restricted stock
    units, collectively referred to as restricted stock, and stock
    options had lower grant date fair values than the grant date
    fair value of restricted stock and stock options that became
    fully amortized during the related periods;

•

The decrease in the maximum purchase limits under our Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, and a lower grant date fair value
    of purchase rights granted; and

•

A decrease in stock bonuses.

Effects
    of Restructuring Plans

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we initiated a
    restructuring plan, or the 2010 Restructuring Plan, which we
    announced in February 2011. The 2010 Restructuring Plan is
    intended to decrease costs by reducing our workforce throughout
    the company by approximately 95 positions. We expect ongoing
    annual savings of $14.5 million related to the 2010
    Restructuring Plan. We expect that substantially all of the
    estimated restructuring plan-related annual operating expense
    savings related to the 2010 restructuring activities will be
    offset by increased costs in connection with developing and
    enhancing our product technologies.

During fiscal 2009, we initiated a restructuring plan, or the
    2009 Restructuring Plan, to improve our operating results and to
    align our cost structure with expected revenue. The 2009
    Restructuring Plan reduced our workforce throughout the company
    by approximately 345 positions.



During fiscal 2008, we initiated a restructuring plan to improve
    our operating results and to align our cost structure with
    expected revenue. This restructuring plan reduced our workforce
    throughout the company by approximately 625 positions. See
    Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional details of the 2010, 2009 and 2008 restructuring
    plans.

Cost of
    Product

Cost of product includes costs associated with the sale or lease
    of our hardware and licensing of our software and IP products.
    Cost of product primarily includes the cost of employee salary,
    benefits and other employee-related costs, including stock-based
    compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangibles
    directly related to our products, the cost of technical
    documentation and royalties payable to third-party vendors. Cost
    of product associated with our hardware products also includes
    materials, assembly and overhead. These additional manufacturing
    costs make our cost of hardware product higher, as a percentage
    of revenue, than our cost of software and IP products.

Hardware costs decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared to
    fiscal 2008, primarily due to a decrease in hardware sales and a
    write-off of obsolete inventory that did not recur during fiscal
    2009.

Amortization of acquired intangibles included in Cost of product
    increased during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, due to
    amortization of intangible assets associated with the Denali
    acquisition. Amortization of acquired intangibles included in
    Cost of product decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared to
    fiscal 2008, due to the impairment of certain acquired
    intangibles during fiscal 2008.

Cost of product depends primarily upon the extent to which we
    acquire intangible assets, acquire licenses and incorporate
    third-party technology in our products that are licensed or sold
    in any given period, and the actual mix of hardware and software
    product sales in any given period.

We expect Cost of product to increase in fiscal 2011, as
    compared to fiscal 2010, due to expected increases in hardware
    revenue in 2011 and due to a full year of amortization of
    intangible assets associated with the Denali acquisition.

Cost of
    Services

Cost of services primarily includes employee salary, benefits
    and other employee-related costs, costs to maintain the
    infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization and
    provisions for contract losses, if any. Cost of services
    decreased by $7.5 million during fiscal 2010, as compared
    to fiscal 2009, and decreased by $12.8 million during
    fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, due to the following:

    amortization of intangible assets directly related to our
    maintenance contracts. Cost of maintenance decreased

The increase in our operating expenses during fiscal 2010, as
    compared to fiscal 2009, is primarily due to higher
    employee-related costs, including the additional costs related
    to our acquisition of Denali, which primarily affected our
    Research and development expenses. These costs include ongoing
    Denali operating expenses and expenses related to deferred
    Denali acquisition payments. See Note 4 to our Consolidated
    Financial Statements for an additional description of the
    deferred Denali acquisition payments.

Our operating expenses also increased during fiscal 2010, as
    compared to fiscal 2009, due to higher salary, commissions,
    benefits and other employee-related costs because of improved
    business levels that resulted in increased sales commissions and
    other employee incentive compensation.

The increases in operating expenses related to our acquisition
    of Denali and increased employee-related costs were partially
    offset by the decrease in bad debt expense during fiscal 2010,
    as compared to fiscal 2009, that we recorded in our General and
    administrative expenses, and by decreased employee-related costs
    due to our restructuring activities. Bad debt expense decreased
    by $38.1 million during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal
    2009, due to recording allowances for doubtful accounts of
    $21.6 million during fiscal 2009 and releasing
    $16.5 million of the reserve during fiscal 2010, as a
    result of collections on certain receivables that were
    previously included in our allowance for doubtful accounts.

Operating expenses decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared to
    fiscal 2008, primarily due to reduced headcount and related
    costs as a result of our 2008 and 2009 restructuring plans, and
    our cost savings initiatives to reduce discretionary spending.
    In addition, fiscal 2008 was a 53-week fiscal year, while fiscal
    2009 was a 52-week fiscal year.

We expect operating expenses to increase in fiscal 2011, as
    compared to fiscal 2010, due to the significant release of our
    allowances for doubtful accounts in fiscal 2010, which we do not
    expect to recur in fiscal 2011. We also expect increases in
    salary, commissions, benefits and other employee-related costs
    in fiscal 2011, as compared



to fiscal 2010, because we expect to include a full year of
    expenses associated with the employment of former Denali
    employees and also expect the anticipated improvements in our
    business to result in higher incentive compensation.

Bad debt expense decreased by $38.1 million during fiscal
    2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, due to recording allowances
    for doubtful accounts of $21.6 million during fiscal 2009
    and releasing $16.5 million of the reserve during fiscal
    2010 as a result of collections on certain receivables that were
    previously included in our allowance for doubtful accounts. See
    Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for an
    additional description of our allowance for doubtful accounts.

Legal and other professional services costs decreased during
    fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to a
    decrease in professional services fees related to our proposed
    acquisition of Mentor Graphics Corporation and the restatement
    of our previously issued financial statements for the periods
    ended March 29, 2008 and June 28, 2008 that did not
    recur during fiscal 2009. For an additional description of our
    current litigation, see Note 15 to our Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Losses on the sale of installment contract receivables decreased
    during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, due to a
    reduction in sales of receivables. The change in our license mix
    has resulted in an increased number of subscription licenses and
    a decrease in the sale of receivables to financial institutions
    because we generally do not sell the receivables associated with
    subscription licenses.

Executive severance costs during fiscal 2008 relate to the cash
    payable to three of the five executives who resigned in October
    2008. The expense related to the other two resignations of
    executives is included in our Sales and marketing and Research
    and development expenses.

We expect General and administrative expenses to increase in
    fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, due to the significant
    release of our allowances for doubtful accounts in fiscal 2010,
    which we do not expect to recur in fiscal 2011.

Restructuring
    and Other Charges

We have initiated multiple restructuring plans since 2001,
    including a 2010 Restructuring Plan. See Note 7 to our
    Consolidated Financial Statements for an additional description
    of these restructuring plans.

Because the restructuring charges and related benefits are
    derived from management’s estimates made during the
    formulation of the restructuring plans, based on then-currently
    available information, our restructuring plans may not achieve
    the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level
    contemplated. Demand for our products and services and,
    ultimately, our future financial performance, is difficult to
    predict with any degree of certainty. Accordingly, additional
    actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may
    be required in the future.

    Restructuring Plan

During fiscal 2010, we recorded Restructuring and other charges
    associated with the 2010 Restructuring Plan of
    $13.2 million. Of the $13.2 million, $9.1 million
    is comprised of estimated severance payments, severance-related
    benefits and costs for outplacement services that we determined
    were both probable and estimable as of January 1, 2011. The
    costs relate to approximately 95 employees who were
    notified after January 1, 2011. All of the
    $9.1 million of accrued severance and associated benefits
    is included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2011. Because
    of varying regulations in the jurisdictions and countries in
    which we operate, these workforce reductions will be realized
    during fiscal 2011 and are expected to be completed by the end
    of fiscal 2011.

As part of the 2010 Restructuring Plan, we determined we would
    change our research and development plans related to certain
    purchased software technology and related assets. We evaluated
    the net realizable value of these assets and recorded an
    impairment charge of $3.5 million.

During fiscal 2010, and as part of the 2010 Restructuring Plan,
    we recorded a lease loss accrual of $0.4 million related to
    a facility we consolidated and had vacated prior to
    January 1, 2011. We expect to record an additional
    $1.0 million to $2.0 million in restructuring expenses
    related to consolidating facilities included in the 2010
    Restructuring Plan as we vacate those facilities in future
    periods.



We expect ongoing annual savings of $14.5 million related
    to the restructuring activities we initiated during the fourth
    quarter of 2010 and announced in February 2011. We expect that
    substantially all of the estimated restructuring plan-related
    annual operating expense savings related to the 2010
    restructuring activities will be offset by increased costs in
    connection with developing and enhancing our product
    technologies.

    severance payments, severance-related benefits and costs for
    outplacement services. As of January 1, 2011, we had paid
    substantially all of the severance payments related to the 2009
    Restructuring Plan.

During fiscal 2010, we recorded a net credit of
    $3.4 million, consisting of a credit of $3.9 million
    in termination and related benefits costs that were less than
    initially estimated and a $0.4 million charge related to
    facilities included in the 2009 Restructuring Plan that we
    vacated during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and
    $0.1 million for assets related to these vacated facilities.

The activity in the Other Restructuring Plans in each of fiscal

    estimates related to lease loss accruals.

Litigation
    Charges

On February 8, 2011 and February 11, 2011, we agreed
    to settle our pending derivative and securities litigation,
    respectively, subject to completion of final settlement
    documentation by the parties and court approval. Accordingly, we
    recorded Litigation charges of $15.8 million in fiscal
    2010, which is total settlement costs of $40.0 million, net
    of $24.2 million we expect will be paid by our insurance
    carriers. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial
    Statements for an additional description of our legal
    proceedings and this settlement.

Impairment
    of Goodwill

We conduct a goodwill impairment analysis annually and as
    necessary if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that
    the fair value of our reporting unit may be less than the
    carrying amount. We completed an interim goodwill impairment
    test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and recorded an
    Impairment of goodwill of $1,317.2 million, representing
    all of our goodwill at that time. For an additional description
    of our impairment of goodwill, see Note 5 to our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Impairment
    of Intangible and Tangible Assets

In connection with our cost savings initiatives that were
    implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we made
    certain changes to our DFM product strategy. As a result, we
    recognized an impairment charge of $42.5 million arising
    from the abandonment of certain identifiable intangible assets
    and reducing to net realizable value certain other identifiable
    intangible assets. We also abandoned and impaired
    $4.6 million of other long-lived assets during fiscal 2008.

The increase in interest expense during fiscal 2010, as compared

    Notes that were issued in June 2010. For an additional
    description of our 2015 Notes and Convertible Senior Notes, see
    Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

We expect to incur a full year of interest expense related to
    the 2015 Notes during fiscal 2011. As a result, we expect
    interest expense to increase in fiscal 2011, as compared to
    fiscal 2010.

During fiscal 2010, we recorded gains totaling $4.9 million
    for five cost method investments that were liquidated. We also
    repurchased a portion of our Convertible Senior Notes and
    recorded a loss for the early extinguishment of debt. See
    Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for an
    additional description of this loss.

The decrease in interest income during fiscal 2009, as compared
    to fiscal 2008, was due to lower average cash balances and lower
    interest rates.

We determined that certain of our non-marketable securities were

other-than-temporarily

impaired and we wrote down the investments by $1.5 million
    during fiscal 2010, $5.2 million during fiscal 2009 and
    $8.6 million during fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2008, we
    determined that two of our

available-for-sale

securities were

other-than-temporarily

impaired based on the severity and the duration of the
    impairments, and we wrote down the investments by
    $8.1 million. All of these impairments are included in the
    Write-down of investments line in the table above.

During fiscal 2008, we purchased approximately 4.3 million
    shares of Mentor Graphics common stock in connection with our
    proposed acquisition of Mentor Graphics. After the announcement
    of our withdrawal of the proposed acquisition of Mentor Graphics
    during fiscal 2008, we sold our entire equity interest in Mentor
    Graphics at a loss of $9.4 million, which is included in
    the Gains (losses) on

available-for-sale

securities line in the table above.

The $9.3 million loss on liquidation of subsidiary is
    primarily attributable to currency translation adjustment
    losses, net of gains, previously recorded in Accumulated other
    comprehensive income on our Consolidated Balance Sheet for a
    subsidiary that was completely liquidated during fiscal 2008.



Provision
    (Benefit) for Income Taxes

The provision (benefit) for income taxes and the effective tax
    rates during fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 were as

(15)%

Our fiscal 2010 benefit for income taxes is primarily because of
    the decrease in net unrecognized tax benefits and accrued
    interest of $147.9 million as a result of our effective
    settlement of certain tax matters with the IRS in August 2010
    and the release of $66.7 million of valuation allowance
    against our deferred tax assets primarily due to the recognition
    of deferred tax liabilities related to the acquisition of
    intangibles with Denali in June 2010. Our fiscal 2010 benefit
    for income taxes included $4.6 million of tax expense for
    uncertain tax positions that should have been recognized during
    fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009. The effect of this tax expense on
    our Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2010 and on our
    Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2008 and fiscal
    2009 is not considered material.

During fiscal 2009, a change in United States federal tax law
    allowed companies to elect to carry back the fiscal
    2009 net operating loss for a period of three, four or five
    years instead of the general two-year carryback period. Our
    benefit for income taxes during fiscal 2009 is primarily due to
    $27.3 million of tax benefit from the fiscal 2009 United
    States federal net operating losses that can be utilized to
    offset taxable income in prior years, that is partially offset
    by current year interest expense related to unrecognized tax
    benefits of $13.3 million, and an increase in unrecognized
    tax benefits, penalties and interest related to prior year tax
    positions of $14.5 million. With the exception of the
    fiscal 2009 United States federal net operating loss that can be
    utilized in prior years, we recorded a valuation allowance that
    offset the tax benefit from other fiscal 2009 United States
    losses and tax credits. The $14.5 million increase in
    unrecognized tax benefits, penalties and interest during fiscal
    2009 included $7.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits,
    penalties and interest that should have been recognized during
    multiple periods between fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2008. The
    effects on our fiscal 2009 results and our Consolidated
    Financial Statements for prior periods are not considered
    material.

We had a fiscal 2008 provision for income taxes, primarily due
    to the significant fiscal 2008 tax expenses related to the
    impairment of non-deductible goodwill, the increase in our
    valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, and our
    decision to repatriate previously untaxed foreign earnings.
    During fiscal 2008, we recognized the impairment of
    $1,059.7 million of United States goodwill that was
    non-deductible. We also increased the valuation allowance
    against our deferred tax assets by $326.0 million because
    of the uncertainty regarding their ultimate realization. In
    making this judgment, we considered the fiscal 2008 loss that
    resulted in a cumulative three-year loss and other factors.
    Finally, given the challenges in the global capital markets
    during fiscal 2008, we decided that $317.2 million of
    previously untaxed earnings from foreign subsidiaries would not
    be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. As a
    result, we accrued a tax expense of $101.1 million during
    fiscal 2008 to provide for the federal, state and foreign income
    taxes on these repatriations. Our effective tax rate was
    negative for fiscal 2008, primarily due to the fiscal 2008 Loss
    before provision for income taxes and the fiscal 2008 tax
    expenses related to the impairment of non-deductible goodwill,
    the increase in our valuation allowance against our deferred tax
    assets, and our decision to repatriate previously untaxed
    foreign earnings.

We expect to have a provision for income taxes for fiscal 2011
    primarily due to tax expense of certain foreign subsidiaries and
    interest expense on our unrecognized tax benefits. In addition,
    we currently anticipate recording a valuation allowance that
    will offset the potential tax benefit of certain United States
    tax credit carryforwards generated during fiscal 2011. Our
    expectation excludes the impact of possible effective
    settlements of tax examinations that may occur during fiscal
    2011. We also expect that our estimated annual effective tax
    rate to be particularly sensitive to any changes to our
    estimates of tax expense because we expect fiscal 2011 income to
    be near break-even.



We intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately
    $133.0 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign
    subsidiaries as of January 1, 2011, to meet the working
    capital and long-term capital needs of our foreign subsidiaries.
    The unrecognized deferred tax liability for these indefinitely
    reinvested foreign earnings was approximately $61.0 million
    as of January 1, 2011.

We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability
    and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than
    not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not
    be realized. We concluded that a valuation allowance of
    $374.7 million was required as of January 1, 2011.
    This represents a decrease in valuation allowance of
    $8.4 million in comparison with the year ended
    January 2, 2010. If, in the future, we determine that these
    deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized, a
    release of all or part of the related valuation allowance could
    result in a material income tax benefit in the period such
    determination is made.

The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine our income
    tax returns and we have received RARs indicating that the IRS
    has proposed to assess certain tax deficiencies. For further
    discussion regarding our Income taxes, including the calculation
    of our valuation allowance, our deferred tax assets, and the
    status of the IRS examinations, see Note 6 to our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments

As of January 1, 2011, our principal sources of liquidity
    consisted of $570.1 million of Cash and cash equivalents
    and Short-term investments, as compared to $571.3 million
    as of January 2, 2010 and $572.1 million as of
    January 3, 2009. Approximately one-third of our cash and
    cash equivalents is held in accounts in the United States.

Our primary sources of cash during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009
    were:

•

Customer payments for software and IP licenses and from the sale
    or lease of our hardware products;

•

Customer payments for maintenance;

•

Customer payments for engineering services;

•

Proceeds from the issuance of our 2015 Notes;

•

Proceeds from the sale of our 2015 Warrants;

•

Proceeds from the sale of long-term investments; and

•

Cash received for common stock purchases under our employee
    stock purchase plan.



Our primary uses of cash during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 were:

•

Payments relating to salaries, benefits, other employee-related
    costs and other operating expenses, including our restructuring
    plans;

•

Payments to former shareholders of acquired businesses, net of
    cash acquired, including Denali;

•

Repurchase of a portion of our Convertible Senior Notes;

•

Payments made to purchase the 2015 Notes Hedges;

•

Purchases of treasury stock; and

•

Purchases of property, plant and equipment.

We expect that current cash and short-term investment balances
    and cash flows that are generated from operations will be
    sufficient to meet our working capital, other capital and
    liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months.

Net
    Working Capital

Net working capital decreased $270.9 million as of
    January 1, 2011, as compared to January 2, 2010, and

Because our 2011 Notes mature on December 15, 2011, our
    Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2011 includes a
    current liability of $143.3 million representing the
    $150.0 million principal amount of the 2011 Notes, net of
    the applicable discount. Discount amortization will continue
    during fiscal 2011 and the carrying value of the 2011 Notes will
    equal the $150.0 million principal amount at maturity.

Prior to the maturity of the 2015 Notes, holders of the 2015
    Notes have the right to surrender their notes for conversion
    into cash during any fiscal quarter, and only during such fiscal
    quarter, if the last reported sale price of our common stock
    exceeds $9.81 for 20 or more trading days in a period of 30
    consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the
    immediately preceding fiscal quarter. If the notes were to
    become convertible (even if holders do not convert their notes),
    the principal balance of the 2015 Notes, net of the associated
    discount would be reported as a current liability on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. Reporting our 2015 Notes as a
    current liability could have a material adverse impact on our
    net working capital.

In connection with the 2015 Notes, we entered into convertible
    note hedge transactions with various financial institutions.
    These convertible note hedge transactions are expected generally
    to reduce our exposure under the 2015 Notes in the event of cash
    conversion of the 2015 Notes.

For an additional description of our 2011 Notes and 2015 Notes,
    see “Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital
    Resources” and Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial
    Statements.



Cash
    Flows from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities increased
    $173.5 million during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal
    2009, and decreased $44.7 million during fiscal 2009, as
    compared to fiscal 2008, due to the following:

Cash flows from operating activities include Net income (loss),
    adjusted for certain non-cash charges, as well as changes in the
    balances of certain assets and liabilities. Our cash flows from
    operating activities are significantly influenced by business
    levels and the payment terms set forth in our license
    agreements. During fiscal 2009 our customers, who are primarily
    concentrated in the semiconductor sector, experienced adverse
    changes in their business due to the challenging economic
    environment. While the semiconductor industry grew and overall
    economic conditions stabilized during fiscal 2010, our customers
    may experience adverse changes in the future that may cause them
    to delay purchasing our products and services or delay or
    default on their payment obligations.

As of January 1, 2011, one customer accounted for 19% of
    our total Receivables, net and Installment contract receivables,
    net. As of January 2, 2010 one customer accounted for 15%
    of our Receivables, net and Installment contract receivables,
    net. As of January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010,
    approximately half of our total Receivables, net and Installment
    contract receivables, net were attributable to ten of our
    customers. If our customers are not successful in generating
    sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing, they
    may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts
    receivable that are owed to us, although these obligations are
    generally not cancelable. Our customers’ inability to
    fulfill payment obligations may adversely affect our cash flow.
    Additionally, our customers may seek to renegotiate pre-existing
    contractual commitments. Though we have not yet experienced a
    material level of defaults, any material payment default by our
    customers or significant reductions in existing contractual
    commitments would have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition and cash flows from operations.

We have entered into agreements whereby we may transfer accounts
    receivable to certain financial institutions on a non-recourse
    or limited-recourse basis. During fiscal 2009, we transferred
    accounts receivable to financial institutions on a non-recourse
    basis, totaling $5.8 million, net of the losses on the sale
    of the receivables, as compared to $52.2 million during
    fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2010, we did not transfer any of our
    accounts receivable to financial institutions. The change in our
    license mix has resulted in an increased number of subscription
    licenses and, therefore, a decrease in the sale of receivables
    to financial institutions. For an additional description of our
    sales of receivables, see Note 17 to our Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

We expect to pay $15.8 million in cash related to the
    settlement of our shareholder and derivative litigation, which
    is total settlement costs of $40.0 million, net of
    $24.2 million we expect will be paid by our insurance
    carriers. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial
    Statements for an additional description of our legal
    proceedings and this settlement.

During fiscal 2008 and 2009, we initiated restructuring plans to
    decrease costs by reducing our workforce and by consolidating
    facilities. In February 2011, we announced additional
    restructuring activities that we initiated during the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2010 to decrease costs by reducing our
    workforce and by consolidating facilities. We expect that
    substantially all of the estimated restructuring plan-related
    annual operating expense savings related to the 2010
    restructuring activities will be offset by increased spending in
    connection with developing and enhancing our product
    technologies.



As of January 1, 2011, we have paid of $74.5 million
    in connection with the restructuring plans initiated in 2008 and
    2009. We expect to pay an additional $11.1 million related
    to the 2008, 2009 and 2010 restructuring activities, of which
    $9.1 million is for termination benefits related to the
    2010 restructuring activities. We expect substantially all
    termination benefits related to the 2010 Restructuring Plan to
    be paid by the end of fiscal 2011.

We expect that cash flows from operating activities will
    fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors,
    including the timing of our billings and collections, the timing
    and amount of tax payments and our operating results.

Cash
    Flows from Investing Activities

Our primary investing activities during fiscal 2010 and fiscal
    2009 consisted of:

•

Cash paid in business combinations and asset acquisitions, net
    of cash acquired;

•

Purchases and proceeds from the sale of property, plant and
    equipment; and

•

Proceeds from the sale of

available-for-sale

securities and long-term investments.

Net cash used for investing activities decreased
    $234.6 million during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal
    2009 and decreased $76.4 million during fiscal 2009, as
    compared to fiscal 2008, due to the following:

During fiscal 2010, we acquired Denali for an aggregate initial
    purchase price of $296.8 million, which was paid in cash.
    For an additional description of our acquisition of Denali, see
    Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In connection with our acquisitions completed before
    January 1, 2011, we may be obligated to pay up to an
    aggregate of $17.9 million during the next 27 months
    if certain defined performance goals are achieved in full, of
    which $10.2 million would be expensed in our Consolidated
    Statements of Operations.

During fiscal 2008, we purchased approximately 4.3 million
    shares of Mentor Graphics common stock for $62.4 million in
    connection with our proposed acquisition of Mentor Graphics.
    After the announcement of our withdrawal of the proposed
    acquisition of Mentor Graphics we sold our entire equity
    interest in Mentor Graphics for $53.0 million.

In January 2007, we completed the sale of certain land and
    buildings in San Jose, California for a sales price of
    $46.5 million in cash. Concurrently with the sale, we
    leased back from the purchaser all available space in the
    buildings. During the lease term, we constructed an additional
    building on our San Jose, California campus to replace the
    buildings we sold in this transaction. The decrease in cash
    payments for Property, plant and equipment during fiscal 2009,
    as compared to fiscal 2008, is primarily due to the completion
    of this new building in January 2009.

We expect to continue our investing activities, including
    purchasing property, plant and equipment, purchasing intangible
    assets, purchasing software licenses, business combinations, and
    making long-term equity investments.



Cash
    Flows from Financing Activities

During fiscal 2010, we issued $350.0 million principal
    amount of the 2015 Notes. Concurrently with the issuance of the
    2015 Notes, we entered into the 2015 Notes Hedges with various
    parties to reduce the potential cash outlay from the conversion
    of the 2015 Notes and to mitigate the negative effect such
    conversion may have on the price of our common stock. In
    separate transactions, we sold warrants, or the 2015 Warrants,
    to purchase our common stock at a price of $10.78 per share to
    various parties. We used an aggregate of $187.2 million of
    the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2015 Notes to purchase
    in the open market $100.0 million principal amount of our
    2011 Notes and $100.0 million principal amount of our 2013
    Notes, and we repurchased approximately 6.5 million shares
    of our common stock at a cost of $40.0 million.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 in a separate
    transaction, we repurchased in the open market $5.5 million
    principal amount of our 2013 Notes.

Net cash provided by financing activities increased by
    $38.9 million during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal
    2009. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal
    2009 was $21.0 million, as compared to net cash used for
    financing activities of $443.4 million during fiscal 2008.
    The changes in our financing cash flows are due to the following:

During fiscal 2010, we paid $9.7 million of taxes related
    to employee stock transactions. See Note 6 to our
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this
    payment.

The decrease in Proceeds from the issuance of common stock
    during fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, and during
    fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, is primarily due to
    decreased purchase limits under our ESPP, which became effective
    during fiscal 2009.

When treasury stock is reissued at a price higher than its cost,
    the difference is recorded as a component of Capital in excess
    of par in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. When treasury stock
    is reissued at a price lower than its cost, the difference is
    recorded as a component of Capital in excess of par to the
    extent that there are treasury stock gains to offset the losses.
    If there are no treasury stock gains in Capital in excess of
    par, the losses upon reissuance of treasury stock are recorded
    as a component of Accumulated deficit in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. We recorded losses on the reissuance of treasury
    stock of $87.4 million during fiscal 2010,
    $213.4 million during fiscal 2009 and $110.6 million
    during fiscal 2008.

As of January 1, 2011, we have $814.4 million
    remaining under the stock repurchase programs authorized by our
    Board of Directors. See Note 12 to our Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

The $150.0 million principal amount of our 2011 Notes is
    due on December 15, 2011.



Other
    Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources

Income Taxes

We provide for United States income taxes on earnings of our
    foreign subsidiaries unless the earnings are considered
    indefinitely invested outside the United States. During fiscal
    2010, we repatriated $63.4 million of previously taxed
    earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, resulting in cash tax
    payments of approximately $1.9 million. As of
    January 1, 2011, we had a deferred tax liability of
    $5.2 million related to $8.6 million of earnings from
    certain foreign subsidiaries that are not considered
    indefinitely reinvested outside the United States and for which
    we have previously made a provision for income tax.

We intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately
    $133.0 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign
    subsidiaries as of January 1, 2011, to meet the working
    capital and long-term capital needs of our foreign subsidiaries.
    The unrecognized deferred tax liability for these indefinitely
    reinvested foreign earnings was approximately $61.0 million
    as of January 1, 2011.

The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine our income
    tax returns and we have received RARs pursuant to which the IRS
    has proposed to assess certain tax deficiencies. For an
    additional description of our IRS Examinations, see Note 6
    to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

During fiscal 2010, we determined that uncertain tax positions
    that were subject to the IRS examination of our federal income
    tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002 were effectively
    settled. In prior fiscal periods, we made cash deposits of
    approximately $8.9 million to the IRS related to this
    settlement. During fiscal 2010, net of tax refunds we expect to
    receive, we made additional cash payments, of approximately
    $0.9 million to the IRS and to various state and local tax
    authorities to cover our remaining tax liabilities related to
    this settlement.

During fiscal 2010, we released $66.7 million of valuation
    allowance against our deferred tax assets due to the acquisition
    accounting for Denali. This release of the valuation allowance
    is primarily related to deferred income tax liabilities for
    acquired intangible assets and does not impact our current or
    future cash position.

As of January 1, 2011, we had current income tax
    liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of
    $5.8 million. As of January 1, 2011, we had long-term
    income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of
    $76.6 million. For an additional description of the income
    tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, see the
    discussion under the heading “Contractual Obligations.”

2.625% Cash Convertible Senior Notes Due 2015

In June 2010, we issued $350.0 million principal amount of
    our 2015 Notes to four initial purchasers in a private placement
    pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as
    amended, or the Securities Act, for resale to qualified
    institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A of the
    Securities Act. Concurrently with the issuance of the 2015
    Notes, we entered into the 2015 Notes Hedges with various
    parties to reduce the potential cash outlay from the cash
    conversion of the 2015 Notes and to mitigate the negative effect
    such cash conversion may have on the price of our common stock.
    In separate transactions, we sold the 2015 Warrants to various
    parties. The 2015 Notes mature on June 1, 2015, and will be
    paid in cash at maturity. As of January 1, 2011, none of
    the conditions allowing the holders of the 2015 Notes to convert
    had been met; however, the price of our common stock has
    recently been near or greater than the stock price necessary to
    allow holders of the 2015 Notes to convert. If this stock price
    condition is met in accordance with the terms of the 2015 Notes,
    then upon any conversion of the 2015 Notes by holders we would
    be required to pay a settlement amount determined in accordance
    with the terms of the 2015 Notes. In that event, the 2015 Notes
    Hedges counterparties would generally be required to pay to us
    an amount equal to the cash conversion value of the 2015 Notes
    that have been converted to the extent that the cash conversion
    value exceeds the par amount of the converted 2015 Notes. For an
    additional description of the 2015 Notes, including the hedge
    and warrants transactions, see Note 3 to our Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due December 15,
    2011 and 1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due
    December 15, 2013

In December 2006, we issued $250.0 million principal amount
    of our 2011 Notes and $250.0 million of our 2013 Notes to
    three initial purchasers in a private placement pursuant to
    Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for resale



to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A of
    the Securities Act. Concurrently with the issuance of the
    Convertible Senior Notes, we entered into the Convertible Senior
    Notes Hedges with various parties to reduce the potential
    dilution from the conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes and
    to mitigate the negative effect such conversion may have on the
    price of our common stock. In separate transactions, we sold the
    Convertible Senior Notes Warrants to various parties. The 2011
    Notes mature on December 15, 2011 and the 2013 Notes mature
    on December 15, 2013, and the principal amounts will be
    paid in cash at maturity. As of January 1, 2011, none of
    the conditions allowing the holders of the Convertible Senior
    Notes to convert had been met. Because the 2011 Notes mature on
    December 15, 2011, our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
    January 1, 2011 includes a current liability of
    $143.3 million representing the $150.0 million
    principal amount of the 2011 Notes, net of the applicable
    discount. Discount amortization will continue during fiscal 2011
    and the carrying value of the 2011 Notes will equal the
    $150.0 million principal amount at maturity.

In connection with the issuance of the 2015 Notes, we used an
    aggregate of $187.2 million of the net proceeds to purchase
    in the open market $100.0 million principal amount of our
    2011 Notes and $100.0 million principal amount of our 2013
    Notes, resulting in a remaining principal balance of
    $150.0 million for the 2011 Notes and $150.0 million
    for the 2013 Notes. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 in
    a separate transaction, we repurchased in the open market
    $5.5 million principal amount of our 2013 Notes, which
    resulted in a remaining principal balance for the 2013 Notes of
    $144.5 million. We also sold a portion of the Convertible
    Senior Notes Hedges and purchased a portion of the Convertible
    Senior Notes Warrants at the time of these repurchases. For an
    additional description of the Convertible Senior Notes,
    including the hedge and warrants transactions, see Note 3
    to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The 2023 Notes are due in August 2023. However, the holders of
    the 2023 Notes can require us to repurchase for cash the
    remaining portion of the 2023 Notes on August 15, 2013 for
    100.00% of the principal amount. Therefore, we have included
    $0.2 million of principal of the 2023 Notes on the
    potential repurchase of the 2023 Notes in the 1-3 Years
    column in the table above.

(2)

Included in other long-term contractual obligations are
    long-term income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax
    benefits of $76.6 million, and of that amount we estimate
    that $60.7 million will be paid or settled within 1 to
    3 years. We did not include the remaining long-term income
    tax liabilities of $15.9 million in the table above,
    because we estimated that this liability can be offset by
    available net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and
    that future cash payments will not be required to settle this
    liability. However, the total amounts of income tax payable and
    the timing of such tax payments may



depend upon the resolution of current and future tax
    examinations that cannot be estimated with certainty. The
    remaining portion of other long-term contractual obligations is
    primarily liabilities associated with defined benefit retirement
    plans and acquisition-related liabilities.

(3)

As reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
    January 1, 2011, Long-term liabilities includes
    $130.2 million related to the 2015 Notes Embedded
    Conversion Derivative. This amount is not included in the table
    above because any future cash payments related to this liability
    would be offset by cash received from the 2015 Notes Hedges. For
    an additional description of the 2015 Notes, including the hedge
    and warrants transactions, see Note 3 to our Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

(4)

Prior to the maturity of the 2015 Notes, holders of the 2015
    Notes have the right to surrender their notes for conversion
    into cash during any fiscal quarter, and only during such fiscal
    quarter, if the last reported sale price of our common stock
    exceeds $9.81 for 20 or more trading days in a period of 30
    consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the
    immediately preceding fiscal quarter. If the notes were to
    become convertible (even if holders do not convert their notes),
    the principal balance of the 2015 Notes, net of the associated
    discount, would be reported as a current liability on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. In connection with the 2015 Notes,
    we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with various
    financial institutions. These convertible note hedge
    transactions are expected generally to reduce our exposure under
    the 2015 Notes in the event of cash conversion of the 2015 Notes.

With respect to purchase obligations that are cancelable by us,
    the table includes the amount that would have been payable if we
    had canceled the obligation as of January 1, 2011 or the
    earliest cancellation date.

In connection with our acquisitions completed before
    January 1, 2011, we may be obligated to pay up to an
    aggregate of $17.9 million in cash during the next
    27 months if certain defined performance goals are achieved
    in full.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

As of January 1, 2011, we did not have any significant
    off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in
    Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC

Regulation S-K.

New
    Accounting Standards

In October 2009, the FASB issued new accounting standards for
    multiple-deliverable arrangements and for revenue arrangements
    that include both tangible products and software elements.

The new standards for multiple-deliverable arrangements enable
    vendors to account for products or services (deliverables)
    separately rather than as a combined unit. These standards
    establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling
    price of a deliverable based on: (a) vendor-specific
    objective evidence; (b) third-party evidence; or
    (c) estimates. These standards also eliminate the residual
    method of allocation and require that arrangement consideration
    be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all
    deliverables using the relative selling price method. In
    addition, these standards significantly expand required
    disclosures related to a vendor’s multiple-deliverable
    revenue arrangements.

Under the new standards for revenue arrangements that include
    both tangible products and software elements, tangible products
    containing software components and nonsoftware components that
    function together to deliver the tangible product’s
    essential functionality are excluded from the pre-existing
    software revenue standards. In addition, hardware components of
    a tangible product containing software components are always
    excluded from the pre-existing software revenue standards.

We have adopted these standards prospectively as of
    January 2, 2011, the first day of fiscal 2011, for multiple
    element arrangements involving our emulation hardware systems
    and for other nonsoftware related deliverables. The impact of
    these new standards will result in revenue being recognized for
    certain sales of hardware and nonsoftware deliverables that are
    separate from the software deliverables within a multiple
    element arrangement, which may result in the value of up-front
    revenue orders exceeding 10% of the total value of all orders in
    a single fiscal quarter. The nature and magnitude of the
    specific effects will depend on the arrangements we enter into
    with multiple deliverables after the adoption date, but we do
    not expect the application of these new standards will impact
    our intended mix of orders for fiscal 2011, as outlined under
    the heading “Results of Operations —
    Revenue.”



Item 7A.
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk

Foreign
    Currency Risk

Most of our revenue, expenses and material business activity are
    transacted in the United States dollar. However, certain of our
    operations include transactions in foreign currencies and,
    therefore, we benefit from a weaker dollar, and in certain
    countries, in particular, Japan, where we invoice customers in
    the local currency, we are adversely affected by a stronger
    dollar. The primary effect of foreign currency transactions on
    our results of operations from a weakening United States dollar
    is an increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in
    expenses. Conversely, the primary effect of foreign currency
    transactions on our results of operations from a strengthening
    United States dollar is a reduction in revenue offset by a
    smaller reduction in expenses.

We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with
    financial institutions to protect against currency exchange
    risks associated with existing assets and liabilities. A foreign
    currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing
    in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying
    liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange
    rates. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract
    decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or
    underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in
    foreign exchange rates. These forward contracts are not
    designated as accounting hedges and, therefore, the unrealized
    gains and losses are recognized in Other income (expense), net,
    in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the
    fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued
    liabilities or other current assets.

Our policy governing hedges of foreign currency risk does not
    allow us to use forward contracts for trading purposes. Our
    forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or
    less. The effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our
    ability to estimate future asset and liability exposures. We
    enter into currency forward exchange contracts based on
    estimated future asset and liability exposures. Recognized gains
    and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will
    ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the
    amount of currency forward exchange contracts with actual
    underlying asset and liability exposures.

The following table provides information, as of January 1,
    2011, about our forward foreign currency contracts. The
    information is provided in United States dollar equivalent
    amounts. The table presents the notional amounts, at contract
    exchange rates, and the weighted average contractual foreign
    currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign
    currency per United States dollar, which in some cases may not
    be the market convention for quoting a particular currency. All
    of these forward contracts mature before or during March 2011.

While we actively monitor our foreign currency risks, there can
    be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities
    will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency
    exchange rates on our results of operations, cash flows and
    financial position.

Interest
    Rate Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
    relates primarily to our portfolio of Cash and cash equivalents.
    While we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of
    the world’s leading industrialized countries, our interest
    income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the
    general level of United States interest rates. In this regard,
    changes in United States interest rates affect the interest
    earned on our Cash and cash equivalents and the costs associated
    with foreign currency hedges.

We invest in high quality credit issuers and, by policy, limit
    the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer. As part of
    our policy, our first priority is to reduce the risk of
    principal loss. Consequently, we seek to preserve our invested
    funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment
    risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality
    credit securities that we believe to have low credit risk, and
    by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a
    significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment
    issuer or guarantor. The short-term interest-bearing portfolio
    of Cash and cash equivalents includes only marketable securities
    with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio
    liquidity.

All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or
    less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash
    equivalents. Investments with maturities greater than three
    months are classified as

available-for-sale

and are considered to be short-term investments. The carrying
    value of our interest-bearing instruments approximated fair
    value as of January 1, 2011. The following table presents
    the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates
    for our interest-bearing instruments, which are all classified
    as Cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheet

2.625% Cash Convertible Senior Notes Due 2015

In June 2010, we issued $350.0 million principal amount of
    our 2015 Notes. In a separate private placement transaction, we
    also sold warrants to various parties for the purchase of up to
    approximately 46.4 million shares of Cadence’s common
    stock at a price of $10.78 per share. These warrants expire on
    various dates from September 2015 through December 2015 and must
    be settled in net shares. For an additional description of our
    2015 Notes, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources, Other
    Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources,” and
    Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due December 15,
    2011 and 1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due

In December 2006, we issued $250.0 million principal amount
    of our 2011 Notes and $250.0 million of our 2013 Notes. For
    an additional description of our 2011 Notes and 2013 Notes, see
    “Liquidity and Capital Resources, Other Factors Affecting
    Liquidity and Capital Resources,” and Note 3 to our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Investments



We have a portfolio of equity investments that includes
    marketable equity securities and non-marketable equity
    securities. Our equity investments are made primarily in
    connection with our strategic investment program. Under our
    strategic investment program, from time to time we make cash
    investments in companies with technologies that are potentially

Item 9A.
    Controls and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We carried out an evaluation required by

Rule 13a-15

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the
    Exchange Act, under the supervision and with the participation
    of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, or
    CEO, and our Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act) as of January 1, 2011.

The evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures
    included a review of our processes and the effect on the
    information generated for use in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

In the course of this evaluation, we sought to identify any
    material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures,
    to determine whether we had identified any acts of fraud
    involving personnel who have a significant role in our
    disclosure controls and procedures, and to confirm that any
    necessary corrective action, including process improvements, was
    taken. This type of evaluation is done every fiscal quarter so
    that our conclusions concerning the effectiveness of these
    controls can be reported in our periodic reports filed with the
    SEC. The overall goals of these evaluation activities are to
    monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and to make
    modifications as necessary. We intend to maintain these
    disclosure controls and procedures, modifying them as
    circumstances warrant.



Based on their evaluation as of January 1, 2011, our CEO
    and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and
    procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that
    the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports
    filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
    specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and is accumulated
    and communicated to our management, including the CEO and CFO,
    as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure.

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
    reporting during the quarter ended January 1, 2011 that
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent
    Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that
    our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control
    over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and
    all fraud. Internal control over financial reporting, no matter
    how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable,
    not absolute, assurance that the objectives of internal control
    are met. Further, the design of internal control must reflect
    the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
    of the control must be considered relative to their costs. While
    our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
    financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance
    of their effectiveness, because of the inherent limitations in
    all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
    absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
    fraud, if any, within Cadence have been detected.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
    in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Exchange Act). Our management assessed the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of January 1, 2011. In making this assessment, our
    management used the criteria established in

Internal
    Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Our
    management has concluded that, as of January 1, 2011, our
    internal control over financial reporting is effective based on
    these criteria. Our independent registered public accounting
    firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an attestation report on our internal
    control over financial reporting, which is included in
    Item 15, “Exhibits and Financial Statement
    Schedules.”

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Cadence Design Systems, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as
    of January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss), and
    cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
    January 1, 2011. In connection with our audits of the
    consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the
    financial statement schedule, as set forth under
    Item 15(a)(2). These consolidated financial statements and
    financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial
    statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
    January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010, and the results
    of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years
    in the three-year period ended January 1, 2011, in
    conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement
    schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
    financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Cadence Design Systems, Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of January 1, 2011, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated
    February 24, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Cadence Design Systems, Inc.:

We have audited Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and
    subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial
    reporting as of January 1, 2011, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting included in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of January 1, 2011, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and
    subsidiaries as of January 1, 2011 and January 2,
    2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss), and
    cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
    January 1, 2011, and our report dated February 24,
    2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
    financial statements and the accompanying financial statement
    schedule.

CADENCE
    DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS

January 1, 2011

NOTE 1.

CADENCE

Cadence Design Systems, Inc., or Cadence, licenses electronic
    design automation, or EDA, software and silicon intellectual
    property, or IP. Cadence sells or leases hardware technology and
    provides engineering and education services throughout the world
    to help manage and accelerate electronic product development
    processes. Cadence customers use its products and services to
    design and develop complex integrated circuits, or ICs, and
    electronic systems.

NOTE 2.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles
    of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

Cadence’s fiscal year end is the Saturday closest to
    December 31. Fiscal 2010 and 2009 were 52-week years.
    Fiscal 2008 was a 53-week year. The consolidated financial
    statements include the accounts of Cadence and its subsidiaries
    after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. All
    consolidated subsidiaries are wholly-owned by Cadence.

Use
    of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with United States generally accepted accounting
    principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts
    of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates.

Cash,
    Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

Cadence considers all highly liquid debt instruments, including
    commercial paper, European Union euro time deposits, repurchase
    agreements and certificates of deposit, with remaining
    maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be
    cash equivalents. Investments with maturities greater than three
    months and less than one year are classified as Short-term
    investments.

Foreign
    Operations

Cadence transacts business in various foreign currencies. The
    United States dollar is the functional currency of
    Cadence’s consolidated entities operating in the United
    States and Cadence’s principal Irish, Israeli, Hungarian
    and Dutch subsidiaries. The functional currency for
    Cadence’s other consolidated entities operating outside of
    the United States is generally the local country’s
    currency, which is the primary currency in which the entity
    generates and expends cash. Cadence translates the financial
    statements of consolidated entities whose functional currency is
    not the United States dollar into United States dollars. Cadence
    translates assets and liabilities at the exchange rate in effect
    as of the financial statement date and translates statement of
    operations accounts using the average exchange rate for the
    period. Cadence includes translation adjustments from foreign
    exchange and the effect of exchange rate changes on intercompany
    transactions of a long-term investment nature in
    Stockholders’ Equity as a component of Accumulated other
    comprehensive income. Cadence reports gains and losses from
    foreign exchange rate changes related to intercompany
    receivables and payables that are not of a long-term investment
    nature, as well as gains and losses from foreign currency
    transactions, in its Consolidated Statements of Operations.
    There were no significant gains or losses on the liquidation of
    subsidiaries during fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009. Cadence
    recognized a $9.9 million loss attributable to currency
    translation adjustment losses, net of gains, from the complete
    liquidation of a subsidiary during fiscal 2008.



Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Cadence enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts
    with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange
    risks associated with existing assets and liabilities. A foreign
    currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing
    in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying
    liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange
    rates. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract
    decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or
    underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in
    foreign exchange rates. The forward contracts are not designated
    as accounting hedges and, therefore, the unrealized gains and
    losses are recognized in Other income (expense), net, in advance
    of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of
    these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or
    other current assets.

Cadence does not use forward contracts for trading purposes.
    Cadence’s forward contracts generally have maturities of
    90 days or less. Recognized gains or losses with respect to
    Cadence’s current hedging activities will ultimately depend
    on how accurately it is able to match the amount of currency
    forward exchange contracts with underlying asset and liability
    exposures.

Receivables
    and Allowances for Doubtful Accounts

Cadence’s accounts receivable and installment contract
    receivables are recorded at fair value, which approximates their
    carrying values. Cadence’s Receivables, net balance on its
    Consolidated Balance Sheets includes invoiced accounts
    receivable and the current portion of unbilled installment
    contract receivables. Installment contract receivables represent
    amounts Cadence has recorded as revenue for which payments from
    a customer are due over time. Cadence’s long-term
    Installment contract receivables, net balance on its
    Consolidated Balance Sheets includes installment contract
    receivable balances to be invoiced at future dates more than one
    year after each balance sheet date. Upon invoicing of an
    unbilled installment contract receivable, the invoiced amount is
    included in the accounts receivable balance.

Cadence’s current and long-term installment contract
    receivables as of January 1, 2011 have been invoiced, or
    will be invoiced during the next three years, as follows:

Each fiscal quarter, Cadence analyzes the creditworthiness of
    its customers, historical experience, changes in customer
    demand, and the overall economic climate in the industries that
    Cadence serves, makes judgments as to its ability to collect
    outstanding receivables, and provides allowances for the portion
    of receivables when collection is not probable. Provisions are
    made based upon a specific review of customer receivables and
    are recorded in operating expenses. Cadence recorded a recovery
    of its allowances for doubtful accounts of $16.5 million
    during fiscal 2010 as a result of collections on certain
    receivables that were included in Cadence’s allowance for
    doubtful accounts as of January 2, 2010. Cadence recorded
    allowances for doubtful accounts of $21.6 million during
    fiscal 2009 and $4.5 million during fiscal 2008.
    Receivables and installment contract receivables are presented
    net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $7.6 million as
    of January 1, 2011 and $23.7 million as of
    January 2, 2010.

Cadence’s customers are primarily concentrated within the
    semiconductor sector, which was adversely affected by the 2008
    and 2009 economic downturn, but experienced growth during 2010.
    As of January 1, 2011, one customer accounted for 19% of
    Cadence’s total Receivables, net and Installment contract
    receivables, net. As of



January 2, 2010 one customer accounted for 15% of
    Cadence’s Receivables, net and Installment contract
    receivables, net. As of January 1, 2011 and January 2,
    2010, approximately half of Cadence’s total Receivables,
    net and Installment contract receivables, net were attributable
    to the ten customers with the largest balances of Receivables,
    net and Installment contract receivables, net. As a result of
    receiving payments related to a portion of the outstanding
    receivables against which Cadence had previously recorded
    allowances, Cadence has decreased its allowance for doubtful
    accounts to $7.6 million as of January 1, 2011, as
    compared to $23.7 million as of January 2, 2010. Of
    the $7.6 million allowance for doubtful accounts as of
    January 1, 2011, $6.9 million relates to one customer
    whose outstanding gross accounts receivable balance is due in
    the first half of 2011. If Cadence recovers any portion of that
    $6.9 million, it will result in a reduction of its
    operating expenses.

Cadence believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts is
    adequate, but Cadence will continue to monitor customer
    liquidity and other economic conditions, which may result in
    changes to Cadence’s estimates regarding its allowance for
    doubtful accounts. The adequacy of the allowance for doubtful
    accounts is evaluated by Cadence at least quarterly, and any
    adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts resulting
    from these evaluations could be material to Cadence’s
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value.
    Cadence’s inventories include high technology parts and
    components for complex computer systems that emulate the
    performance and operation of computer IC and electronic systems.
    These parts and components may be specialized in nature or
    subject to rapid technological obsolescence. While Cadence has
    programs to minimize the required inventories on hand and
    considers technological obsolescence when estimating required
    reserves to reduce recorded amounts to market values, it is
    reasonably possible that such estimates could change in the near
    term. Cadence’s practice is to reserve for inventory in
    excess of

12-month

demand.

Due to the complex nature of Cadence’s emulation systems,
    Cadence purchases certain components from a single supplier. In
    addition, Cadence currently contracts with a single manufacturer
    to assemble these components. As such, Cadence may be exposed to
    the risk of delays in receiving these components due to its
    reliance on a single supplier and due to manufacturing
    constraints or other delays in the manufacturing process.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost.
    Depreciation and amortization are generally provided over the
    estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, as
    follows:

Computer equipment and related software

2-7 years

Buildings

10-32 years

Leasehold and building improvements

Shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life

Furniture and fixtures

3-5 years

Equipment

3-5 years

Cadence capitalizes the costs of software developed for internal
    use. Capitalization of software developed for internal use
    begins at the application development phase of the project.
    Capitalization of software developed for internal use ends, and
    amortization begins, when the computer software is substantially
    complete and ready for its intended use. Amortization is
    recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
    life. Cadence capitalized $5.2 million during fiscal 2010,
    $10.5 million during fiscal 2009 and $15.6 million
    during fiscal 2008 for costs of software developed for internal
    use.

Cadence recorded depreciation and amortization expense in the
    amount of $61.7 million during fiscal 2010,
    $69.4 million during fiscal 2009 and $77.9 million
    during fiscal 2008 for property, plant and equipment. Cadence
    abandoned and impaired certain long-lived assets of
    $0.5 million during fiscal 2010, $6.7 million during
    fiscal 2009 and $2.2 million during fiscal 2008, and these
    charges are included throughout Cadence’s operating
    expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
    Operations. In addition, Cadence abandoned and impaired certain
    long-



lived assets of $4.6 million during fiscal 2008, and this
    charge is included in Impairment of intangible and tangible
    assets in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Software
    Development Costs

Software development costs are capitalized beginning when a
    product’s technological feasibility has been established by
    completion of a working model of the product and amortization
    begins when a product is available for general release to
    customers. The period between the achievement of technological
    feasibility and the general release of Cadence’s products
    has typically been of short duration and costs incurred during
    fiscal 2010 have not been material.

Goodwill

Cadence conducts a goodwill impairment analysis annually and as
    necessary if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that
    the fair value of Cadence’s reporting unit may be less than
    its carrying amount. Cadence’s goodwill impairment test
    consists of two steps. The first step requires that Cadence
    compare the estimated fair value of its single reporting unit to
    the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets,
    including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is
    greater than the carrying value of its net assets, goodwill is
    not considered to be impaired and no further testing is
    required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than
    the carrying value of its net assets, Cadence would be required
    to complete the second step of the test by analyzing the fair
    value of its goodwill. If the carrying value of the goodwill
    exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded.

In connection with the preparation of Cadence’s fiscal 2008
    financial statements, Cadence performed an interim goodwill
    impairment test and recorded an Impairment of goodwill of
    $1,317.2 million, representing all of Cadence’s
    goodwill at the time. See Note 5 for an additional
    description of Cadence’s goodwill impairment analysis.

Long-lived
    Assets, including Acquired Intangibles

Cadence’s long-lived assets consist of property, plant and
    equipment and other acquired intangibles, excluding goodwill.
    Acquired intangibles with definite lives are amortized on a
    straight-line basis over the remaining estimated economic life
    of the underlying products and technologies (original lives
    assigned are one to twelve years). Cadence reviews its
    definite-lived long-lived assets for impairment whenever events
    or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
    a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an
    asset group is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to
    the expected future undiscounted cash flows that the asset group
    is expected to generate. If it is determined that an asset group
    is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded in the amount
    by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair
    value. In addition, Cadence assesses its long-lived assets for
    impairment if they are abandoned.

Non-Marketable
    Securities

Cadence’s non-marketable securities include investments in
    privately-held companies, and these investments are initially
    recorded at cost. To determine the fair value of these
    privately-held investments, Cadence uses the most recent round
    of financing or estimates of current fair value using
    traditional valuation techniques. It is Cadence’s policy to
    review the fair value of these investments on a regular basis to
    determine whether the investments in these companies are

other-than-temporarily

impaired. This evaluation includes, but is not limited to,
    reviewing each company’s cash position, financing needs,
    earnings or revenue outlook, operational performance, management
    or ownership changes and competition and is based on information
    that Cadence receives from these companies. This information is
    not subject to the same disclosure regulations as United States
    publicly-traded companies, and as such, the basis for these
    evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the
    data received from these companies. If Cadence believes the
    carrying value of an investment is in excess of fair value, and
    this difference is

other-than-temporary,

it is Cadence’s policy to write down the investment to its
    estimated fair value.



Nonqualified
    Deferred Compensation Trust

Executive Officers, senior management and members of
    Cadence’s Board of Directors may elect to defer
    compensation payable to them under Cadence’s 1994
    Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan, or the NQDC. Deferred
    compensation payments are held in accounts with values indexed
    to the performance of selected investments. Cadence consolidates
    the NQDC trust accounts in its Consolidated Financial Statements.

The selected investments held in the NQDC trust are classified
    as trading securities. Trading securities are stated at fair
    value, with the unrealized gains and losses recognized in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations as Other income (expense),
    net. These trading securities are classified as Other assets in
    the Consolidated Balance Sheets because the securities are not
    available for Cadence’s use in its operations.

Cadence’s obligation with respect to the NQDC trust is
    recorded in Other long-term liabilities on its Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. Increases and decreases in the NQDC liability
    are recorded as compensation expense in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations.

Deferred
    Revenue

Deferred revenue arises when customers are billed for products
    or services in advance of revenue recognition. Cadence’s
    deferred revenue consists primarily of unearned revenue on
    maintenance and product licenses for which revenue is recognized
    over the duration of the license. The fees under product
    licenses for which revenue is not recognized immediately and for
    maintenance in connection with term and subscription licenses
    are generally billed quarterly in advance and the related
    revenue is recognized over multiple periods over the ensuing
    license period. Maintenance on perpetual licenses is generally
    renewed annually, billed in full in advance, and the
    corresponding revenue is recognized over the ensuing

12-month

maintenance term.

Comprehensive
    Income (Loss)

Other comprehensive income (loss) includes foreign currency
    translation gains and losses, changes in defined benefit plan
    liabilities, and unrealized gains and losses on marketable
    securities that are

available-for-sale

that have been excluded from Net income (loss) and reflected
    instead in Stockholders’ equity. Cadence has reported
    comprehensive income (loss) in its Consolidated Statements of
    Stockholders’ Equity. Cadence reclassified from unrealized
    holding gains and losses on marketable securities to realized
    gains included in Other income (expense), net, in the
    accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations,
    $2.3 million during fiscal 2009, without any tax effect and
    ($7.9) million during fiscal 2008, without any tax effect.
    During fiscal 2010, Cadence recorded net unrealized holding
    gains on available-for sale securities of $6.4 million, net
    of tax effect of $2.9 million. Cadence did not have a tax
    benefit for gross unrealized holding losses in marketable equity
    securities during fiscal 2009 or fiscal 2008. For an additional
    description of the unrealized holding losses and associated tax
    effect, see Note 8 and Note 14.

Revenue
    Recognition

License
    Types

Cadence
    licenses its products using three different license types:

•

Subscription licenses;

•

Term licenses; and

•

Perpetual licenses.

For many of Cadence’s term and subscription license
    arrangements, Cadence uses its internet-based delivery
    mechanism,

“eDA-on-tap,”

to facilitate the delivery of its software products. Cadence
    created two types of “eDA Cards” that utilize

eDA-on-tap.

Subscription license customers may purchase an “eDA
    Platinum Card,” providing the customer access to and use of
    all software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement
    and the ability to use additional unspecified software products
    that may become commercially available during the term of the
    arrangement, until the fees have been depleted. Term license
    customers may purchase an “eDA Gold Card,” providing
    the customer access to and use of all software products
    delivered at the outset of the arrangement, until the



fees have been depleted. Overall, the eDA Cards provide greater
    flexibility for Cadence’s customers in how and when they
    deploy and use Cadence’s software products.

Subscription licenses

– Cadence’s
    subscription license arrangements offer customers the right to:

•

Access and use all software products delivered at the outset of
    an arrangement throughout the entire term of the arrangement,
    generally two to four years, with no rights to return;

•

Use unspecified additional software products that become
    commercially available during the term of the
    arrangement; and

•

Remix among the software products delivered at the outset of the
    arrangement, as well as the right to remix into other
    unspecified additional software products that may become
    available during the term of the arrangement, so long as the
    cumulative value of all products in use does not exceed the
    total license fee determined at the outset of the arrangement.
    These remix rights may be exercisable multiple times during the
    term of the arrangement. The right to remix all software
    products delivered pursuant to the license agreement is not
    considered an exchange or return of software because all
    software products have been delivered and the customer has the
    continuing right to use them.

In general, revenue associated with subscription licenses is
    recognized ratably over the term of the license commencing upon
    the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery
    of the first software product. Subscription license revenue is
    allocated to product and maintenance revenue. The allocation to
    maintenance revenue is based on vendor specific objective
    evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of the undelivered maintenance
    that was established in connection with the sale of
    Cadence’s term licenses that contain stated annual renewal
    rates.

Term licenses

– Cadence’s term license
    arrangements offer customers the right to:

•

Access and use all software products delivered at the outset of
    an arrangement throughout the entire term of the arrangement,
    generally two to four years, with no rights to return; and

•

Remix among the software products delivered at the outset of the
    arrangement, so long as the cumulative value of all products in
    use does not exceed the total license fee determined at the
    outset of the arrangement. These remix rights may be exercisable
    multiple times during the term of the arrangement. The right to
    remix all software products delivered pursuant to the license
    agreement is not considered an exchange or return of software
    because all software products have been delivered and the
    customer has the continuing right to use them.

In general, Product revenue associated with term licenses that
    include a stated annual maintenance renewal rate is recognized
    upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or
    delivery of the software product and Maintenance revenue is
    recognized ratably over the maintenance term. In general,
    Product and Maintenance revenue associated with term licenses
    that do not include a stated annual maintenance renewal rate is
    recognized ratably over the term of the license, commencing upon
    the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery
    of the first software product. The allocation to maintenance
    revenue is based on VSOE of fair value of the undelivered
    maintenance that was established in connection with the sale of
    Cadence’s term licenses that contain stated annual renewal
    rates.

Perpetual licenses

– Cadence’s perpetual
    licenses consist of software licensed on a perpetual basis with
    no right to return or exchange the licensed software. In
    general, revenue associated with perpetual licenses is
    recognized upon the later of the effective date of the license
    or delivery of the licensed product.

Timing
    of Revenue Recognition

Cadence recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the fee is
    fixed or determinable, collection of the resulting receivable is
    probable, and VSOE exists.

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement

–
    Generally, Cadence uses a contract signed by the customer as
    evidence of an arrangement for subscription and term licenses
    and hardware leases. If a contract signed by the customer does
    not exist, Cadence has historically used a purchase order as
    evidence of an arrangement for perpetual licenses, hardware
    sales, maintenance renewals and small fixed-price service
    projects, such as training classes and small methodology service
    engagements. For all other service engagements, Cadence uses a
    signed professional



services agreement and a statement of work to evidence an
    arrangement. In cases where both a signed contract and a
    purchase order exist, Cadence considers the signed contract to
    be the most persuasive evidence of the arrangement. Sales
    through Cadence’s distributors are evidenced by a master
    agreement governing the relationship, together with binding
    purchase orders from the distributor on a

transaction-by-transaction

basis.

Product delivery

– Software and the
    corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers
    electronically. Electronic delivery occurs when Cadence provides
    the customer access to the software. Occasionally, Cadence will
    deliver the software on a DVD with standard transfer terms of

free-on-board,

or F.O.B., shipping point. Cadence’s software license
    agreements generally do not contain conditions for acceptance.
    With respect to hardware, delivery of an entire system is deemed
    to occur upon its successful installation. For certain hardware
    products, installation is the responsibility of the customer, as
    the system is fully functional at the time of shipment. For
    these products, delivery is deemed to be complete when the
    products are shipped with freight terms of F.O.B. shipping point.

For customers who purchase eDA Gold or eDA Platinum Cards,
    delivery occurs when the customer has been provided with access
    codes that allow the customer to download the software pursuant
    to the terms of the software license agreement.

Fee is fixed or determinable

– Cadence assesses
    whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the
    arrangement, primarily based on the payment terms associated
    with the transaction. Cadence has established a history of
    collecting under the original contract without providing
    concessions on payments, products or services. For installment
    contracts that do not include a substantial up-front payment,
    Cadence only considers that a fee is fixed or determinable if
    the arrangement has payment periods that are equal to or less
    than the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in
    equal or nearly equal installments, when evaluated over the
    entire term of the arrangement. Cadence has a history of
    collecting receivables under installment contracts of up to five
    years.

Significant judgment is involved in assessing whether a fee is
    fixed or determinable. Cadence must also make these judgments
    when assessing whether a contract amendment to a term
    arrangement (primarily in the context of a license extension or
    renewal) constitutes a concession. Cadence’s experience has
    been that it is able to determine whether a fee is fixed or
    determinable for term licenses. While Cadence does not expect
    that experience to change, if Cadence no longer were to have a
    history of collecting under the original contract without
    providing concessions on term licenses, revenue from term
    licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under
    the installment contract become due and payable. Such a change
    could have a material impact on Cadence’s results of
    operations.

Collection is probable

– Cadence assesses the
    probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of
    the arrangement based on a number of factors, including the
    customer’s payment history and its current
    creditworthiness. If in Cadence’s judgment collection of a
    fee is not probable, Cadence defers the revenue until the
    uncertainty is removed, generally upon receipt of cash payment.

Vendor-specific objective evidence of fair
    value

– Cadence’s VSOE for certain product
    elements of an arrangement is based upon the pricing in
    comparable transactions when the element is sold separately.
    VSOE for maintenance is based upon the customer’s stated
    annual renewal rates. VSOE for services is generally based on
    the price charged when the services are sold separately. For
    multiple element arrangements, VSOE must exist to allocate the
    total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of a term
    or perpetual license arrangement. If VSOE of all undelivered
    elements exists, revenue is recognized using the residual
    method. Under the residual method, the VSOE of the undelivered
    elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the
    arrangement fee is recognized up-front as the elements are
    delivered. If VSOE does not exist for all elements to support
    the allocation of the total fee among all elements of the
    arrangement, or if VSOE does not exist for all undelivered
    elements to apply the residual method, revenue is recognized
    ratably over the term of the undelivered elements.
    Cadence’s experience has been that it is able to determine
    VSOE for maintenance when a stated annual renewal rate is
    included in the arrangement. Cadence has not established VSOE
    for product, including licenses that include the right to
    receive unspecified future software products, or for annual
    maintenance that is not cancellable by the customer.



Other
    Factors Affecting Revenue Recognition

Multiple element arrangement

– A multiple
    element arrangement, or MEA, is any arrangement that includes or
    contemplates rights to a combination of software or hardware
    products, software license types, services, training or
    maintenance in a single arrangement. From time to time, Cadence
    may include individual deliverables in separately priced and
    separately signed contracts with the same customer. Cadence
    obtains and evaluates all known relevant facts and circumstances
    in determining whether the separate contracts should be
    accounted for individually as distinct arrangements or whether
    the separate contracts are, in substance, a MEA. Significant
    judgment can be involved in determining whether a group of
    contracts might be so closely related that they are, in effect,
    part of a single arrangement.

Finance fee revenue

– Finance fees result from
    discounting to present value the product revenue derived from
    installment contracts in which the payment terms extend beyond
    one year from the effective date of the contract. Finance fees
    are recognized using a method that approximates the effective
    interest method over the relevant license term and are
    classified as product revenue. Finance fee revenue represented
    less than 1% of total revenue during fiscal 2010, approximately
    2% of total revenue during fiscal 2009 and approximately 3% of
    total revenue during fiscal 2008. Upon the sale of an
    installment contract, Cadence recognizes the remaining finance
    fee revenue associated with the installment contract.

Services revenue

– Services revenue consists
    primarily of revenue received for performing engineering
    services. These services are not related to the functionality of
    the products licensed. Revenue from service contracts is
    recognized either on the time and materials method, as work is
    performed, or on the

percentage-of-completion

method. For contracts with fixed or

not-to-exceed

fees, Cadence estimates on a monthly basis the

percentage-of-completion

based on the completion of milestones relating to the
    arrangement. Cadence has a history of accurately estimating
    project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A
    number of internal and external factors can affect these
    estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency
    variances and specification and testing requirement changes. If
    different conditions were to prevail such that accurate
    estimates could not be made, then the use of the completed
    contract method would be required and the recognition of all
    revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was
    completed. Such a change could have a material impact on
    Cadence’s results of operations.

Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental
    authorities

– Cadence applies the net basis
    presentation for taxes collected from customers and remitted to
    governmental authorities.

Accounting
    for Income Taxes

Cadence accounts for the effect of income taxes in its
    Consolidated Financial Statements using the asset and liability
    method. Cadence must make significant judgments in calculating
    its provision (benefit) for income taxes. Cadence is required to
    estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which
    it operates. This process involves estimating actual current tax
    liabilities together with assessing temporary differences
    resulting from differing treatment of items, such as
    depreciation, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences
    result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using
    enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
    years when those temporary differences are expected to be
    recovered or settled. To measure the deferred tax assets and
    liabilities, Cadence’s judgments include anticipating the
    tax positions Cadence will take on tax returns for future years.
    The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
    tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes
    the enactment date.

Cadence then records a valuation allowance to reduce the
    deferred tax assets to the amount that Cadence believes is more
    likely than not to be realized based on its judgment of all
    available positive and negative evidence. Deferred tax assets
    are realized by an enterprise by having sufficient taxable
    income to allow the related tax benefits to reduce taxes
    otherwise payable. Accordingly, the taxable income must be both
    of an appropriate character (e.g., capital versus ordinary,
    foreign versus United States source income) and within the
    carryback and carryforward periods permitted by law. In making
    such assessments, Cadence must make significant judgments about
    the possible sources of taxable income and the evidence
    available about each possible source of taxable income on a
    jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. The weight given to the
    potential effect of negative and positive evidence is
    commensurate with the extent to which the strength of the
    evidence can be objectively verified. For example, a



company’s current year or previous losses are given more
    weight than its future outlook. For the years ended
    January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010, Cadence concluded
    that a significant valuation allowance was required based on its
    evaluation and weighting of the positive and negative evidence.
    For the year ended January 1, 2011, Cadence released
    $8.4 million of valuation allowance against its deferred
    tax assets. The 2010 change in valuation allowance included a
    $66.7 million release of the valuation allowance resulting
    from the acquisition accounting for Denali Software, Inc., or
    Denali, in June 2010, which provided a source of taxable income
    to allow Cadence deferred tax assets to be considered
    realizable. See Note 6 for an additional description of
    this change. If, in the future, Cadence determines that its
    deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized, a
    release of all or part, of the related valuation allowance could
    result in a material income tax benefit in the period such
    determination is made.

Cadence takes a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring
    the financial statement benefit of uncertain tax positions. The
    first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by
    determining whether the weight of available evidence indicates
    that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
    sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals
    or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax
    benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of
    being realized upon effective settlement of the audit. Cadence
    reevaluates its income tax positions on a quarterly basis to
    consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances,
    changes in or interpretations of tax law, effectively settled
    issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in
    recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax
    benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. For the
    year ended January 1, 2011 Cadence determined that
    uncertain tax positions that were subject to the Internal
    Revenue Service, or IRS, examination of Cadence’s federal
    income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002, were
    effectively settled and Cadence recognized a benefit for income
    taxes of $147.9 million. See Note 6 for an additional
    description of this benefit. Cadence classifies interest and
    penalties on unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.

Cadence is also required to assess whether the earnings of its
    foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested outside the
    United States. As of January 1, 2011, Cadence had
    recognized a deferred tax liability of $5.2 million related
    to $8.6 million of earnings from certain foreign
    subsidiaries that are not considered indefinitely reinvested
    outside the United States. Changes in Cadence’s actual or
    projected operating results, tax laws or Cadence’s
    interpretation of tax laws, foreign exchange rates and
    developments in current and future tax audits could
    significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in
    Cadence’s results of operations, financial position or cash
    flows.

Restructuring
    Charges

Cadence accounts for restructuring charges with customary
    termination benefits when the costs are both probable and
    estimable. The costs are both probable and estimable on the date
    Cadence determines the number of employees whose positions will
    be terminated, their job classifications or functions, their
    location and the expected termination date, even if the actual
    positions are not finalized. Cadence accounts for restructuring
    charges with non-standard termination benefits when the plan has
    been communicated to the affected employees.

In connection with its restructuring plans, Cadence has made a
    number of estimates and assumptions related to losses on excess
    facilities vacated or consolidated, particularly the timing of
    subleases and sublease terms. Closure and space reduction costs
    included in the restructuring charges include payments required
    under leases less any applicable estimated sublease income after
    the facilities are abandoned, lease buyout costs and certain
    contractual costs to maintain facilities during the period after
    abandonment.

In addition, Cadence has recorded estimated provisions for
    termination benefits and outplacement costs, long-term asset
    impairments and other restructuring costs. Cadence regularly
    evaluates the adequacy of its restructuring accrual, and adjusts
    the balance based on changes in estimates and assumptions.
    Cadence may incur future charges for new restructuring plans as
    well as for changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Cadence recognizes the cost of employee services received in
    exchange for awards of equity instruments as stock-based
    compensation expense. Stock-based compensation expense is
    measured at the grant date based on the value of the restricted
    stock award or restricted stock unit, collectively referred to
    as restricted stock, option or



purchase right and is recognized as expense, less expected
    forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which typically
    equals the vesting period. The fair value of each option grant
    and each purchase right granted under Cadence’s Employee
    Stock Purchase Program, or ESPP, is estimated on the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair
    value of each restricted stock issuance is determined using the
    fair value of Cadence’s common stock on the grant date.
    Cadence recognizes stock-based compensation expense on the
    straight-line method for stock options and restricted stock that
    only contain a service condition and on the graded-vesting
    method for restricted stock that contain both a service and
    performance condition. Determining the fair value of stock
    options and purchase rights under the ESPP at the grant date
    requires judgment, including estimating the following:

•

Expected volatility of Cadence’s stock;

•

Expected term of stock options and purchase rights under the
    ESPP;

•

Risk-free interest rate for the period;

•

Expected dividends, if any; and

•

Expected forfeitures.

The computation of the expected volatility assumption used in
    the Black-Scholes option pricing model for new grants is based
    on implied volatility when the remaining maturities of the
    underlying traded options are at least one year and, when the
    remaining maturities of the underlying traded options are less
    than one year, it is based on an equal weighting of historical
    and implied volatilities.

When establishing the expected term assumption, Cadence reviews
    annual historical employee exercise behavior with respect to
    option grants having similar vesting periods. The risk-free
    interest rate for the period within the expected term of the
    option is based on the yield of United States Treasury notes in
    effect at the time of grant. Cadence has not historically paid
    dividends, thus the expected dividends used in the calculation
    are zero.

Judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock-based
    awards that Cadence expects to be forfeited. Cadence calculates
    a separate expected forfeiture rate for both stock options and
    restricted stock issuances based on historical trends. Judgment
    is also required to estimate the attainment of certain
    predetermined performance goals for a performance-based bonus
    plan, under which payments may be made in Cadence common stock,
    and performance-based restricted stock grants. Each period,
    Cadence estimates the most likely outcome of such performance
    goals and recognizes any related stock-based compensation
    expense. The amount of stock-based compensation expense
    recognized in any one period can vary based on the attainment or
    estimated attainment of the various performance goals. If such
    performance goals are not met, no compensation expense is
    recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is
    reversed.

The valuation of all options, including the expected term of
    stock options and ESPP purchase rights, are calculated based on
    one employee pool because there is no significant difference in
    exercise behavior between classes of employees. The expected
    forfeiture rates for options and restricted stock are calculated
    based on an employee pool and an executive pool due to the
    vesting acceleration provisions in certain executive employment
    agreements.

Treasury
    Stock

When treasury stock is reissued at a price higher than its cost,
    the difference is recorded as a component of Capital in excess
    of par in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’
    Equity. When treasury stock is reissued at a price lower than
    its cost, the difference is recorded as a component of Capital
    in excess of par to the extent that there are gains to offset
    the losses. If there are no treasury stock gains in Capital in
    excess of par, the losses upon reissuance of treasury stock are
    recorded as a component of Retained earnings (Accumulated
    deficit) in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’
    Equity. Cadence recorded losses on the reissuance of treasury
    stock as a component of Retained earnings (Accumulated deficit)
    of $87.4 million during fiscal 2010, $213.4 million
    during fiscal 2009 and $110.6 million during fiscal 2008.

Concentrations
    of Credit Risk

Financial instruments, including derivative financial
    instruments, that may potentially subject Cadence to
    concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash and
    cash equivalents, short-term investments, long-term



investments, accounts receivable and forward contracts.
    Cadence’s customers are primarily concentrated within the
    semiconductor sector, which was adversely affected by the 2008
    and 2009 economic downturn, but grew during 2010. As of
    January 1, 2011, one customer accounted for 19% of
    Cadence’s total Receivables, net and Installment contract
    receivables, net. As of January 2, 2010 one customer
    accounted for 15% of Cadence’s Receivables, net and
    Installment contract receivables, net. As of January 1,
    2011 and January 2, 2010, approximately half of
    Cadence’s total Receivables, net and Installment contract
    receivables, net relate to ten customers.

Credit exposure related to Cadence’s foreign currency
    forward contracts is limited to the realized and unrealized
    gains on these contracts.

Cadence is party to certain hedge transactions related to its
    convertible notes. Cadence is subject to the risk that the
    counterparties to these hedge transactions may not be able to
    fulfill their obligations under these hedge transactions.
    Cadence purchased options and issued warrants to hedge potential
    dilution of its common stock from the conversion of its
    1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due December 2011, or the
    2011 Notes, and its 1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due
    December 2013, or the 2013 Notes, and collectively with the 2011
    Notes, the Convertible Senior Notes. Changes in the fair value
    of these option and warrant transactions related to
    Cadence’s 2011 Notes and 2013 Notes are not marked to
    market and are not recognized in Cadence’s Consolidated
    Statements of Operations as long as the instruments remain
    classified as equity. See Note 3 for an additional
    description of Cadence’s 2011 Notes and 2013 Notes and
    these option and warrant transactions.

Cadence purchased options and issued warrants to hedge potential
    cash payments in excess of the principal and contractual
    interest related to its 2.625% Cash Convertible Senior Notes Due
    2015, or the 2015 Notes, which were issued during fiscal 2010.
    The 2015 Notes hedges are adjusted to fair value each reporting
    period and unrealized gains and losses are reflected in
    Cadence’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Because
    the fair values of the 2015 Notes embedded conversion derivative
    and the 2015 Notes hedges are similar, there was no impact to
    Cadence’s Consolidated Statements of Operations relating to
    these adjustments to fair value during the fiscal 2010. See
    Note 3 for an additional description of Cadence’s 2015
    Notes and the associated hedge transactions.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

Inputs to valuation techniques are observable or unobservable.
    Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent
    sources, while unobservable inputs reflect Cadence’s market
    assumptions. These two types of inputs have created the
    following fair-value hierarchy:

•

Level 1

– Quoted prices for identical
    instruments in active markets;

•

Level 2

– Quoted prices for similar
    instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or
    similar instruments in markets that are not active, and
    model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and
    significant value drivers are observable in active
    markets; and

•

Level 3

– Valuations derived from
    valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or
    significant value drivers are unobservable.

This hierarchy requires Cadence to minimize the use of
    unobservable inputs and to use observable market data, if
    available, when determining fair value. Cadence recognizes
    transfers between levels of the hierarchy based on the fair
    values of the respective financial instruments at the end of the
    reporting period in which the transfer occurred. There were no
    transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy during
    fiscal 2010.

The fair value of Cadence’s cash and cash equivalents,
    short-term investments, receivables, accounts payable and
    foreign currency forward exchange contracts approximate their
    carrying value due to the short-term nature of these
    instruments. The fair values of Cadence’s long-term
    investments and installment contract receivables approximate
    their carrying values based upon current market rates of
    interest. The fair value of Cadence’s 2015 Notes and
    Convertible Senior Notes are influenced by interest rates and
    Cadence’s stock price and stock price volatility and is
    determined by market trading. The fair values of the embedded
    conversion derivative and hedge transaction associated with
    Cadence’s 2015 Notes are determined using an option pricing
    model based on observable inputs, including Cadence’s stock
    price, stock price volatility and risk-free interest rates. See
    Note 3 for the fair value of Cadence’s 2015 Notes,
    Convertible Senior Notes, Cadence’s Zero Coupon Zero Yield
    Senior Convertible Notes Due 2023, or the 2023 Notes, and
    Cadence’s convertible notes hedges and warrants.



Advertising

Cadence expenses the costs of advertising as incurred.
    Advertising expense was $8.6 million during fiscal 2010,
    $6.7 million during fiscal 2009 and $9.0 million
    during fiscal 2008, and is included in Marketing and sales in
    the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Subsequent
    Events

Cadence evaluated subsequent events through the date on which
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

On February 8, 2011 and February 11, 2011, Cadence
    agreed to settle its pending derivative and securities
    litigation, respectively, subject to completion of final
    settlement documentation by the parties and court approval.
    Accordingly, Cadence recorded Litigation charges of
    $15.8 million in fiscal 2010, which is total settlement
    costs of $40.0 million, net of $24.2 million Cadence
    expects will be paid by its insurance carriers. See Note 15
    for an additional description of Cadence’s legal
    proceedings and this settlement.

NOTE 3. CONVERTIBLE
    NOTES

2.625%
    Cash Convertible Senior Notes Due 2015

In June 2010, Cadence issued $350.0 million principal
    amount of its 2015 Notes. The 2015 Notes have a stated interest
    rate of 2.625%, mature on June 1, 2015 and may be settled
    only in cash. The indenture for the 2015 Notes does not contain
    any financial covenants. Contractual interest payable on the
    2015 Notes began accruing in June 2010 and is payable
    semi-annually each December 1st and June 1st. The
    initial purchasers’ transaction fees and expenses totaling
    $10.6 million were capitalized as deferred financing costs
    and are amortized over the term of the 2015 Notes using the
    effective interest method. An aggregate of $187.2 million
    of the net proceeds from the 2015 Notes was used to purchase
    $100.0 million principal amount of Cadence’s 2011
    Notes, and $100.0 million principal amount of its 2013
    Notes. Cadence also used $40.0 million of the net proceeds
    from the 2015 Notes to repurchase approximately 6.5 million
    shares of Cadence common stock.

Prior to March 1, 2015, holders may convert their 2015
    Notes into cash upon the occurrence of one of the following
    events:

•

The price of Cadence’s common stock reaches $9.81 during
    certain periods of time specified in the 2015 Notes;

•

Specified corporate transactions occur; or

•

The trading price of the 2015 Notes falls below 98% of the
    product of (i) the last reported sale price of
    Cadence’s common stock and (ii) the conversion rate on
    that date.

From March 1, 2015 and until the close of business on the
    second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity
    date, holders may convert their 2015 Notes into cash at any
    time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Cadence may not
    redeem the 2015 Notes prior to maturity.

The initial cash conversion rate for the 2015 Notes is
    132.5205 shares of Cadence common stock per $1,000
    principal amount of 2015 Notes, equivalent to a cash conversion
    price of approximately $7.55 per share of Cadence common stock,
    with the amount due on conversion payable in cash. Upon cash
    conversion, a holder will receive the sum of the daily
    settlement amounts, calculated on a proportionate basis for each
    day, during a specified observation period following the cash
    conversion date.

If a fundamental change occurs prior to maturity and
    Cadence’s stock price is greater than $6.16 per share at
    that time, the cash conversion rate will increase by an
    additional amount of up to 29.8171 shares of Cadence’s
    common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2015 Notes, which
    amount would be paid entirely in cash to each holder that elects
    to convert its 2015 Notes at that time. A fundamental change is
    any transaction or event (whether by means of an exchange offer,
    liquidation, tender offer, consolidation, merger, combination,
    reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) in which more
    than 50% of Cadence’s common stock is exchanged for,
    converted into, acquired for or constitutes solely the right to
    receive, consideration. No fundamental change will have occurred



if at least 90% of the consideration received consists of shares
    of common stock, or depositary receipts representing such
    shares, that are:

•

Listed on, or immediately after the transaction or event will be
    listed on, a United States national securities exchange; or

•

Approved, or immediately after the transaction or event will be
    approved, for quotation on a United States system of automated
    dissemination of quotations of securities prices similar to the
    NASDAQ National Market prior to its designation as a national
    securities exchange.

As of January 1, 2011, none of the conditions allowing the
    holders of the 2015 Notes to convert the 2015 Notes into cash
    had been met.

The cash conversion feature of the 2015 Notes, or the 2015 Notes
    Embedded Conversion Derivative, requires bifurcation from the
    2015 Notes. The 2015 Notes Embedded Conversion Derivative is
    accounted for as a derivative liability, which is included in
    Other long-term liabilities in Cadence’s Consolidated
    Balance Sheet. The fair value of the 2015 Notes Embedded
    Conversion Derivative at the time of issuance of the 2015 Notes
    was $76.6 million, and was recorded as the original debt
    discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of
    the 2015 Notes. This discount is recognized as interest expense
    using the effective interest method over the term of the 2015
    Notes. As of January 1, 2011, the estimated fair value of
    the 2015 Notes Embedded Conversion Derivative was
    $130.2 million.

Concurrently with the issuance of the 2015 Notes, Cadence
    entered into hedge transactions, or the 2015 Notes Hedges, with
    various parties whereby Cadence has the option to receive the
    cash amount that may be due to 2015 Notes holders at maturity in
    excess of the $350.0 million principal amount of the notes,
    subject to certain conversion rate adjustments in the 2015 Notes
    Indenture. These options expire on June 1, 2015 and must be
    settled in cash. The aggregate cost of the 2015 Notes Hedges was
    $76.6 million. The 2015 Notes Hedges are accounted for as
    derivative assets, and are included in Other assets in
    Cadence’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of January 1,
    2011, the estimated fair value of the 2015 Notes Hedges was
    $130.2 million.

The 2015 Notes Embedded Conversion Derivative and the 2015 Notes
    Hedges are adjusted to fair value each reporting period and
    unrealized gains and losses are reflected in Cadence’s
    Consolidated Statements of Operations. Because the fair values
    of the 2015 Notes Embedded Conversion Derivative and the 2015
    Notes Hedges are similar, there was no impact to Cadence’s
    Consolidated Statements of Operations relating to these
    adjustments to fair value during fiscal 2010.

In separate transactions, Cadence also sold warrants, or the
    2015 Warrants, to various parties for the purchase of up to
    approximately 46.4 million shares of Cadence’s common
    stock at a price of $10.78 per share in a private placement
    pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as
    amended, or the Securities Act. The 2015 Warrants expire on
    various dates from September 2015 through December 2015 and must
    be settled in net shares. Cadence received $37.5 million in
    cash proceeds from the sale of the 2015 Warrants, which has been
    recorded as an increase in Stockholders’ equity. Changes in
    the fair value of the 2015 Warrants will not be recognized in
    Cadence’s Consolidated Financial Statements as long as the
    instruments remain classified as equity. The 2015 Warrants are
    included in diluted earnings per share to the extent the impact
    is dilutive. As of January 1, 2011, the 2015 Warrants were
    not dilutive.

The principal amount, unamortized debt discount and net carrying
    amount of the liability component of the 2015 Notes as of
    January 1, 2011 was as follows:

As of

As of January 1, 2011, the if-converted value of the 2015
    Notes exceeded the principal amount of the 2015 Notes. The total
    fair value of the 2015 Notes was $443.0 million.

1.375% Convertible
    Senior Notes Due December 15, 2011 and
    1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due December 15,

In December 2006, Cadence issued $250.0 million principal
    amount of its 2011 Notes and $250.0 million principal
    amount of its 2013 Notes. The indentures for the Convertible
    Senior Notes do not contain any financial covenants. Contractual
    interest payable on the Convertible Senior Notes began accruing
    in December 2006 and is payable semi-annually each
    December 15th and June 15th. In June 2010,
    Cadence repurchased $100.0 million principal amount of its
    2011 Notes and $100.0 million principal amount of its 2013
    Notes, and in November 2010, Cadence repurchased in the open
    market $5.5 million principal amount of its 2013 Notes.
    These repurchases resulted in a remaining principal balance of
    $150.0 million for the 2011 Notes and $144.5 million
    for the 2013 Notes. Because Cadence’s 2011 Notes mature on
    December 15, 2011, its Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
    January 1, 2011 includes a current liability of
    $143.3 million representing the $150.0 million
    principal amount of the 2011 Notes, net of the applicable
    discount. Discount amortization will continue during fiscal 2011
    and the carrying value of the 2011 Notes will equal the
    $150.0 million principal amount at maturity.

Holders may convert their Convertible Senior Notes prior to
    maturity upon the occurrence of one of the following events:

•

The price of Cadence’s common stock reaches $27.50 during
    certain periods of time specified in the Convertible Senior
    Notes;

•

Specified corporate transactions occur; or

•

The trading price of the Convertible Senior Notes falls below
    98% of the product of (i) the last reported sale price of
    Cadence’s common stock and (ii) the conversion rate on
    that date.

From November 2, 2011, in the case of the 2011 Notes, and
    November 1, 2013, in the case of the 2013 Notes, and until
    the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately
    preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their
    Convertible Senior Notes at any time, regardless of the
    foregoing circumstances. Cadence may not redeem the Convertible
    Senior Notes prior to maturity.

The initial conversion rate for the Convertible Senior Notes is
    47.2813 shares of Cadence common stock per $1,000 principal
    amount of Convertible Senior Notes, equivalent to a conversion
    price of approximately $21.15 per share of Cadence common stock.
    Upon conversion, a holder will receive the sum of the daily
    settlement amounts, calculated on a proportionate basis for each
    day, during a specified observation period following the
    conversion date. The daily settlement amount during each date of
    the observation period consists of:

•

Cash up to the principal amount of the note; and

•

Cadence’s common stock to the extent that the conversion
    value exceeds the amount of cash paid upon conversion of the
    Convertible Senior Notes.

If a fundamental change occurs prior to maturity and
    Cadence’s stock price is greater than $18.00 per share at
    that time, the conversion rate will increase by an additional
    amount of up to $8.27 per share, which amount would be paid
    entirely in cash to each holder that elects to convert its
    Convertible Senior Notes at that time. A fundamental change is
    any transaction or event (whether by means of an exchange offer,
    liquidation, tender offer, consolidation,



merger, combination, reclassification, recapitalization or
    otherwise) in which more than 50% of Cadence’s common stock
    is exchanged for, converted into, acquired for or constitutes
    solely the right to receive, consideration. No fundamental
    change will have occurred if at least 90% of the consideration
    received consists of shares of common stock, or depositary
    receipts representing such shares, that are:

•

Listed on, or immediately after the transaction or event will be
    listed on, a United States national securities exchange; or

•

Approved, or immediately after the transaction or event will be
    approved, for quotation on a United States system of automated
    dissemination of quotations of securities prices similar to the
    NASDAQ National Market prior to its designation as a national
    securities exchange.

As of January 1, 2011, none of the conditions allowing the
    holders of the Convertible Senior Notes to convert had been met.

During fiscal 2010, Cadence purchased in the open market
    $100.0 million principal amount of the 2011 Notes and
    $105.5 million of the 2013 Notes. At settlement, the fair
    value of the liability component immediately prior to its
    extinguishment is measured first and the difference between the
    fair value of the aggregate consideration remitted to its
    holders and the fair value of the liability component
    immediately prior to its extinguishment is attributed to the
    reacquisition of the equity component. The components of the
    fiscal 2010 repurchases and related loss on early extinguishment

Concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes,
    Cadence entered into hedge transactions, or the Convertible
    Senior Notes Hedges, with various parties whereby Cadence has
    the option to receive the amount of shares that may be owed to
    Convertible Senior Notes holders at maturity of the notes,
    subject to certain conversion rate adjustments in the
    Convertible Senior Notes Indenture. The aggregate cost of the
    Convertible Senior Notes Hedges was $119.8 million and has
    been recorded as a reduction to Stockholders’ equity. In
    connection with the purchase of a portion of the Convertible
    Senior Notes in June 2010 and November 2010, Cadence also sold a
    portion of the Convertible Senior Notes Hedges representing
    options to purchase approximately 9.7 million shares of
    Cadence’s common stock and received proceeds of
    $0.4 million. The estimated fair value of the remaining
    Convertible Senior Notes Hedges was $1.1 million as of
    January 1, 2011. These options expire on December 15,
    2011, in the case of the 2011 Notes, and December 15, 2013,
    in the case of the 2013 Notes, and must be settled in net
    shares. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the Convertible
    Senior Notes Hedges will not be recognized in Cadence’s
    Consolidated Financial Statements as long as the instruments
    remain classified as equity.

In separate transactions, Cadence also sold warrants, or the
    Convertible Senior Notes Warrants, to various parties for the
    purchase of up to 23.6 million shares of Cadence’s
    common stock at a price of $31.50 per share in a private
    placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.
    Cadence received $39.4 million in cash proceeds from the
    sale of the Convertible Senior Notes Warrants, which has been
    recorded as an increase in Stockholders’ equity. In
    connection with the purchase of a portion of the Convertible
    Senior Notes in June 2010 and November



2010, Cadence also purchased a portion of the Convertible Senior
    Notes Warrants, reducing the number of shares of Cadence common
    stock available for purchase by 9.7 million shares at a
    cost of $0.1 million. The Convertible Senior Notes Warrants
    expire on various dates from February 2012 through April 2012 in
    the case of the 2011 Notes, and February 2014 through April 2014
    in the case of the 2013 Notes, and must be settled in net
    shares. Changes in the fair value of the Convertible Senior
    Notes Warrants will not be recognized in Cadence’s
    Consolidated Financial Statements as long as the instruments
    remain classified as equity. The remaining warrants are included
    in diluted earnings per share to the extent the impact is
    dilutive.

As of January 1, 2011, the if-converted value of the
    Convertible Senior Notes does not exceed the principal amount of
    the Convertible Senior Notes and the total fair value of the
    Convertible Senior Notes, including the equity component, was
    $282.0 million.

Zero
    Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes Due 2023

In August 2003, Cadence issued $420.0 million principal
    amount of its Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes
    Due 2023, or the 2023 Notes. Cadence received net proceeds of
    $406.4 million, after issuance costs of $13.6 million
    that were recorded in Other long-term assets and were amortized
    as interest expense using the straight-line method over five
    years. In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior
    Notes in December 2006, Cadence repurchased $189.6 million
    principal amount of the 2023 Notes, and in August 2008, Cadence
    repurchased $230.2 million principal amount of the 2023
    Notes upon the election of the holders of the 2023 Notes and
    pursuant to the terms of the 2023 Notes, for a total
    consideration of $230.8 million, reducing the balance of
    the outstanding 2023 Notes to $0.2 million. As of
    January 1, 2011, the total fair value of the outstanding
    2023 Notes was $0.2 million.

NOTE 4. ACQUISITIONS

For each of the acquisitions described below, the results of
    operations and the estimated fair value of the assets acquired
    and liabilities assumed have been included in Cadence’s
    Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the
    acquisition.



Denali Software, Inc.

In June 2010, Cadence acquired Denali. Denali was a
    privately-held provider of electronic design automation software
    and intellectual property used in

system-on-chip

design and verification. Cadence acquired Denali to expand its
    portfolio to provide system component modeling and IP
    integration. The goodwill associated with Cadence’s
    acquisition of Denali resulted primarily from Cadence’s
    expectation of synergies from the integration of Denali’s
    product offerings with Cadence’s EDA product offerings. The
    aggregate initial purchase price was $296.8 million, which
    was paid in cash. An additional $12.6 million of payments
    were deferred on the acquisition date and conditioned upon
    certain Denali shareholders remaining employees of Cadence
    during the periods specified in the respective agreements. As of
    January 1, 2011 $10.5 million of the
    $12.6 million has been paid. During fiscal 2010,
    $10.2 million of the $12.6 million was expensed in
    Cadence’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The
    remaining $2.4 million will be expensed in Cadence’s
    Consolidated Statements of Operations over the stated retention
    periods. The $152.2 million of goodwill recorded in
    connection with this acquisition is not expected to be
    deductible for income tax purposes. This acquisition does not
    include any contingent consideration that is subject to
    performance metrics, milestone achievement or other similar
    criteria.

The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase
    price for Denali and the estimated amortization period for the
    acquired intangibles:

Denali’s current assets, property, plant and equipment and
    other assets were reviewed and adjusted to their fair value on
    the date of acquisition, as necessary. Among the current assets
    acquired, $46.7 million was cash and cash equivalents and
    $11.1 million was trade receivables.

The fair values of Denali’s intangible assets were
    determined using the income approach with significant inputs
    that are not observable in the market. Key assumptions include
    the expected future cash flows, the timing of the expected
    future cash flows and the discount rates consistent with the
    level of risk.

Denali’s current liabilities were reviewed and adjusted to
    their fair value on the date of acquisition, as necessary.
    Included in net current liabilities is deferred revenue, which
    represents advance payments from customers. Cadence estimated
    its obligation related to the deferred revenue using the cost

build-up

approach. The cost

build-up

approach determines fair value by estimating the costs relating
    to supporting the obligation plus an assumed profit. The sum of
    the costs and assumed profit approximates the amount that
    Cadence would be required to pay a third party to assume the
    obligation. The estimated costs to fulfill the obligation were
    based on the projected cost structure to provide the contractual
    deliverables. As a result, Cadence recorded deferred revenue of
    $11.3 million, representing Cadence’s estimate of the
    fair value of the contractual obligations assumed.

The financial information in the table below summarizes the
    combined results of operations of Cadence and Denali, on a pro
    forma basis, as though the companies had been combined as of the
    beginning of fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009. The pro forma
    financial information is presented for informational purposes
    only and is not indicative



of the results of operations that would have been achieved if
    the acquisition had taken place on January 3, 2010 or
    January 4, 2009 or of results that may occur in the future.

Because Cadence recorded deferred taxes of $66.7 million,
    primarily related to the intangible assets acquired with Denali,
    Cadence released a corresponding amount of its deferred tax
    asset valuation allowance. The $66.7 million release of the
    valuation allowance was recognized as a benefit for income taxes
    during fiscal 2010. The pro forma net income (loss) presented
    above does not include this non-recurring benefit for income
    taxes. The pro forma tax effects were calculated considering
    Cadence’s valuation allowance position on its United States
    losses and tax credits. See Note 6 for an additional
    description of Cadence’s income taxes.

Other 2010 Acquisition

During fiscal 2010, Cadence acquired another company and
    recorded $3.9 million of Goodwill and $2.2 million of
    intangible assets. The $3.9 million of goodwill recorded in
    connection with this acquisition is not expected to be
    deductible for income tax purposes. Of the $2.2 million of
    intangible assets, $0.5 million was allocated to in-process
    research and development and is classified as an
    indefinite-lived intangible asset until the project is completed
    or abandoned. The remaining $1.7 million of intangible
    assets has a weighted average life of 5 years. The fair
    values of the intangible assets were determined using the income
    approach with significant inputs that are not observable in the
    market. Key assumptions include the expected future cash flows,
    the timing of the expected future cash flows and discount rates
    consistent with the level of risk.

This acquisition includes contingent consideration payments
    based on future financial measures of the acquired technology.
    Cadence makes estimates regarding the fair value of contingent
    consideration liabilities on the acquisition date and at the end
    of each reporting period until the contingency is resolved.
    Cadence estimates the fair value of these liabilities based on
    Cadence’s expectations as to the projected levels of
    business and Cadence’s assessment of the probability of
    achievement. Cadence believes that its estimates and assumptions
    are reasonable, but there is significant judgment involved.
    Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration
    liabilities subsequent to the acquisition are recorded in
    General and administrative expense in Cadence’s
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The contingent consideration arrangement requires payments of up
    to $4.0 million if certain financial measures are met
    during the three-year period subsequent to the consummation of
    the acquisition. This contingent consideration arrangement does
    not require continuing employment of the selling shareholders.
    The initial fair value of the contingent consideration
    arrangement of $0.8 million was determined using the income
    approach with significant inputs that are not observable in the
    market. Key assumptions include discount rates consistent with
    the level of risk of achievement and probability-adjusted
    revenue amounts. The expected outcomes were recorded at net
    present value. The fair value of this contingent consideration
    was $1.0 million as of January 1, 2011.

2008 Acquisition

During fiscal 2008, Cadence acquired a company for an aggregate
    purchase price of $9.4 million, which included the payment
    of cash, the fair value of assumed options and acquisition
    costs. The $3.1 million of goodwill recorded in connection
    with this acquisition is not expected to be deductible for
    income tax purposes and was completely impaired during fiscal
    2008. As part of this acquisition, Cadence acquired intangible
    assets of $8.6 million, including $0.6 million
    allocated to acquired in-process technology. The acquired
    in-process technology was immediately expensed because
    technological feasibility had not been established and no future
    alternative use existed.



Acquisition-Related
    Contingent Consideration

Cadence accounts for business combinations with acquisition
    dates on or before January 3, 2009 under the purchase
    method in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standard, or SFAS, No. 141, “Business
    Combinations,” and contingent consideration is added to
    Goodwill as it is paid. During fiscal 2010, Cadence recorded
    $2.8 million of Goodwill in connection with acquisitions
    accounted for under SFAS No. 141. Cadence accounts for
    business combinations with acquisition dates after
    January 3, 2009 under the acquisition method in accordance
    with the Accounting Standards Codification and contingent
    consideration is recorded at fair value on the acquisition date
    as noted above.

In connection with Cadence’s acquisitions completed before
    January 1, 2011, Cadence may be obligated to pay up to an
    aggregate of $17.9 million in cash (including the up to
    $4.0 million in cash referred to in “Other
    Acquisition” above) during the next 27 months if
    certain defined performance goals are achieved in full, of which
    $10.2 million would be expensed in Cadence’s
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

NOTE 5. GOODWILL
    AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES

Goodwill

Cadence completed its annual goodwill impairment test during the
    third quarter of fiscal 2010 and determined that the fair value
    of Cadence’s single reporting unit substantially exceeded
    the carrying amount of its net assets and that no impairment
    existed.

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during fiscal
    2010 were as follows:

$

158,893

Cadence completed its annual impairment analysis of goodwill
    during the third quarter of fiscal 2008, and determined at that
    time that it satisfied the first step of the two-step goodwill
    impairment test, and no impairment of goodwill was recorded.
    However, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, Cadence
    observed impairment indicators including a further deterioration
    in the market in which Cadence operates and a decrease in its
    market capitalization. Further, Cadence determined indicators
    existed that the fair value of Cadence’s reporting unit was
    less than its carrying amount.

Accordingly, in connection with the preparation of
    Cadence’s year-end financial statements, Cadence completed
    an interim goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2008. As part of the second step of its goodwill
    impairment test, Cadence determined the fair value of its
    goodwill by allocating the estimated fair value of its reporting
    unit to its assets and liabilities, including the estimated fair
    value of its unrecorded intangible assets, on a fair value
    basis. After allocating its assets and liabilities on a fair
    value basis, Cadence recorded an impairment of all of its
    goodwill of $1,317.2 million.

Allocating assets and liabilities on a fair value basis and
    determining the fair value of unrecorded intangible assets
    requires Cadence to make assumptions and estimates about the
    fair value of assets and liabilities where the fair values of
    those assets and liabilities are not readily available or
    observable. In addition, Cadence makes estimates regarding its
    forecasted revenue, expenses and cash flows, its research and
    development activities, its customer turnover rates, applicable
    discount rates and costs of capital and the marketability of its
    current and future technology.



Cadence uses a combination of the income and market valuation
    approaches. In determining its overall conclusion of reporting
    unit fair value, Cadence considers the estimated values derived
    from both the income and market valuation approaches and weighs
    the values from each approach equally.

The income approach provides an estimate of fair value based on
    discounted expected future cash flows. Estimates and assumptions
    with respect to the determination of the fair value of
    Cadence’s reporting unit using the income approach include:

•

Cadence’s operating forecasts;

•

Revenue growth rates; and

•

Risk-commensurate discount rates and costs of capital.

Cadence’s estimates of revenues and costs are based on
    historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of
    external sources, and are developed as part of Cadence’s
    routine long-range planning process.

The market approach provides an estimate of the fair value of
    Cadence’s one reporting unit using various price or market
    multiples applied to the reporting unit’s operating results
    and then applying an appropriate control premium. The control
    premium is determined by considering control premiums offered as
    part of acquisitions in both Cadence’s industry and
    comparable industries.

The market capitalization of Cadence’s reporting unit is an
    indicator of its fair value. Accordingly, the estimated fair
    value of Cadence’s reporting unit using the income and
    market approaches is compared to the market capitalization of
    its reporting unit as one measure that the estimated fair value
    is reasonable.

In connection with the Cadence’s cost savings initiatives
    that were implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008,
    Cadence made certain changes to its Design for Manufacturing
    product strategy. As a result, Cadence recognized an impairment
    charge of $42.5 million arising from the abandonment of
    certain identifiable intangible assets and reducing to net
    realizable value certain other identifiable intangible assets.

NOTE 6. INCOME
    TAXES

During fiscal 2010, Cadence determined that uncertain tax
    positions that were subject to the IRS examination of
    Cadence’s federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000
    through 2002 were effectively settled. Cadence recognized a
    benefit for income taxes of $189.3 million during fiscal
    2010, including a benefit of $147.9 million related to the
    effective settlement and the release of $66.7 million of
    the deferred tax asset valuation allowance primarily resulting
    from the increase in deferred tax liabilities from the
    intangible assets acquired with Denali.

During fiscal 2010, Cadence decreased Common stock and capital
    in excess of par by $9.7 million for taxes related to
    employee stock transactions that should have been recognized
    during fiscal 2007. Cadence recognized the $9.7 million
    payment as Tax effect related to employee stock transactions
    allocated to equity in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
    and Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity and
    Comprehensive Income (Loss) for fiscal 2010, but should have
    recognized this payment during fiscal 2007. Cadence also
    recognized $4.6 million of provision for income taxes
    during fiscal 2010 for uncertain tax positions that should have
    been recognized during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009. The effect
    of the tax payment and the provision for income taxes on
    Cadence’s Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2010
    and on Cadence’s Consolidated Financial Statements for
    fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009 is not considered material.

During fiscal 2009, a United States federal tax law was enacted
    that allows Cadence to elect to carry back its fiscal
    2009 net operating loss for a period of three, four or five
    years to offset taxable income in those preceding tax years.
    Cadence’s effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 reflects the
    $27.3 million tax benefit from the fiscal 2009 United
    States federal net operating loss that Cadence intends to carry
    back to offset taxable income from fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007,
    which is partially offset by current year interest expense
    related to unrecognized tax benefits of



$13.3 million and an increase in unrecognized tax benefits,
    penalties and interest related to prior year tax positions of
    $14.5 million.

Cadence has recognized $7.3 million of provision for income
    taxes during fiscal 2009 that should have been recognized during
    multiple periods between fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2008. As a
    result, Cadence’s Net income (loss) would have increased
    (decreased) as follows, with a corresponding change in
    Cadence’s Provision for income taxes:

The effects on the Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal
    2009 and prior periods are not considered material.

Cadence’s effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 reflects the
    tax expense related to the increase in valuation allowance
    against deferred tax assets, the repatriation of foreign
    earnings and the impairment of non-deductible goodwill. During
    fiscal 2008, Cadence recognized the impairment of
    $1,059.7 million of United States goodwill that was
    non-deductible. Cadence also increased the valuation allowance
    against its deferred tax assets by $326.0 million because
    of the uncertainty regarding their ultimate realization. In
    making this judgment, Cadence considered the fiscal 2008 loss
    that resulted in a cumulative three-year loss and other factors.
    Finally, given the challenges in the global capital markets
    during fiscal 2008, Cadence decided that $317.2 million of
    previously untaxed earnings from foreign subsidiaries would not
    be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. As a
    result, Cadence accrued a tax expense of $101.1 million
    during fiscal 2008 to provide for the federal, state and foreign
    income taxes on these repatriations.

The operating loss carryforwards included in the components of
    deferred tax assets and liabilities table above include excess
    tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. The
    excess tax benefit is not recognized until the deduction reduces
    cash taxes payable. Cadence had unbenefited share-based
    compensation deductions for federal and California tax purposes
    of $5.4 million and $5.2 million, respectively, as of
    January 1, 2011, and $0 million and $2.0 million,
    respectively, as of January 2, 2010. When utilized, the
    estimated tax benefits of approximately $2.5 million will
    result in a credit to stockholder’s equity.

Cadence regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for
    recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance if it is
    more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
    tax assets will not be realized. Cadence considers various
    sources of taxable income and all available positive and
    negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable
    income. Cadence gives significant weight to evidence that can be
    objectively verified. Under this standard Cadence’s current
    year loss, the cumulative three-year loss, and the concern over
    macroeconomic conditions were considered significant negative
    evidence with a high level of objectivity that outweighed
    Cadence’s ability to rely on long-term projections of
    future taxable income in determining whether a valuation
    allowance was needed. Cadence also considered the availability
    of taxable income in the extended carryback years provided under
    the United States federal tax law that was enacted in fiscal
    2009.

Cadence concluded that a valuation allowance of
    $374.7 million was required as of January 1, 2011.
    After consideration of the valuation allowance, Cadence had
    total net deferred tax assets of $6.4 million as of
    January 1, 2011. The net decrease during fiscal 2010 in the
    total valuation allowance was $8.4 million. The net
    deferred tax assets are primarily composed of United States net
    operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The net deferred
    tax assets are presented gross of unrecognized tax benefits,
    which are not directly associated with the net operating loss
    and tax credit carryforwards. These unrecognized tax benefits
    are presented separately as a liability and provide a



source of taxable income for purposes of assessing the
    realizability of the deferred tax assets. Although there is no
    guarantee that these deferred tax assets will be realized,
    Cadence believes that it is more likely than not that it will be
    able to realize the net deferred tax assets over time.

Cadence provides for United States income taxes on the earnings
    of foreign subsidiaries unless the earnings are considered
    indefinitely invested outside of the United States. Given the
    challenges in the global capital markets during fiscal 2008,
    Cadence determined that $317.2 million of previously
    untaxed earnings from its foreign subsidiaries were not
    indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. As a
    result, Cadence accrued a tax expense of $101.1 million
    during fiscal 2008 to provide for the potential federal, state
    and foreign income taxes on these repatriations. During fiscal
    2008, Cadence repatriated to the United States
    $250.0 million of the $317.2 million. Cadence did not
    repatriate any foreign earnings to the United States during
    fiscal 2009. During fiscal 2010, Cadence repatriated to the
    United States $63.4 million of the previously taxed foreign
    earnings. As of January 1, 2011, Cadence had a deferred tax
    liability of $5.2 million related to $8.6 million of
    earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries that are not
    considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States and
    for which Cadence has previously made a provision for income tax.

Cadence intends to indefinitely reinvest $133.0 million of
    undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as of
    January 1, 2011, to meet the working capital and long-term
    capital needs of its foreign subsidiaries. The unrecognized
    deferred tax liability for these indefinitely reinvested foreign
    earnings was $61.0 million as of January 1, 2011.

As of January 1, 2011, Cadence had United States federal
    and California state net operating loss carryforwards of
    $71.5 million and $269.7 million, respectively,
    available to reduce future taxable income. The federal net
    operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates from
    2021 through 2030. The California state net operating loss
    carryforwards will expire at various dates from 2016 through
    2031. For fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2011, no California state
    net operating loss deduction is allowed. Cadence has tax
    effected net operating losses from states other than California
    of $5.2 million, which will expire at various dates from
    2011 through 2030.

As of January 1, 2011, Cadence had United States federal tax
    credit carryforwards of $80.4 million, California state tax
    credit carryforwards of $30.6 million, tax credit
    carryforwards from states other than California of
    $9.3 million, and $4.8 million of tax credit
    carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions. $36.3 million of
    these available tax credits do not expire and carry forward
    indefinitely until utilized and the remaining $88.8 million
    of tax credits will expire at various dates from 2011 through
    2030.

Internal
    Revenue Service Examinations

The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine
    Cadence’s income tax returns. Cadence’s federal income
    tax returns beginning with the 2000 tax year remain subject to
    examination by the IRS. Cadence’s California state income
    tax returns beginning with the 2001 tax year remain subject to
    examination by the California Franchise Tax Board.

In July 2006, the IRS completed its field examination of
    Cadence’s federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000
    through 2002 and issued a Revenue Agent’s Report, or RAR,
    in which the IRS proposed to assess an aggregate tax deficiency
    for the three-year period of $324.0 million. In November
    2006, the IRS revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency for
    the three-year period to be $318.0 million. In October
    2010, the Appeals Office of the IRS, or the Appeals Office
    provided Cadence with copies of the settlement agreements that
    were executed by the Appeals Office in August 2010 that resolved
    the previously disputed tax positions. While Cadence did not
    receive the final IRS determination of the amount that will be
    owed by Cadence prior to January 1, 2011, Cadence considers
    the tax positions to be effectively settled, because the IRS has
    completed its examination procedures and Cadence believes that
    there is a remote possibility that the IRS will re-examine the
    settled tax positions. As a result of this effective settlement
    Cadence recognized a benefit for income taxes of
    $147.9 million in the Consolidated Statements of Operations
    during fiscal 2010.

In May 2009, the IRS completed its field examination of
    Cadence’s federal income tax returns for the tax years 2003
    through 2005 and issued a RAR, in which the IRS proposed to
    assess an aggregate deficiency for the three-year period of
    $94.1 million. In August 2009, the IRS revised the proposed
    aggregate tax deficiency for the three-



year period to $60.7 million. The IRS is contesting
    Cadence’s transfer pricing arrangements with its foreign
    subsidiaries and deductions for foreign trade income. The IRS
    made similar claims against Cadence’s transfer pricing
    arrangements and deductions for foreign trade income in prior
    examinations. Cadence has filed a timely protest with the IRS
    and is seeking resolution of the issues through the Appeals
    Office.

Cadence believes that the proposed IRS adjustments are
    inconsistent with applicable tax laws and Cadence is vigorously
    challenging these proposed adjustments. The RAR is not a final
    Statutory Notice of Deficiency, but the IRS imposes interest on
    the proposed deficiencies until the matters are resolved.
    Interest is compounded daily at rates that are published by the
    IRS, are adjusted quarterly and have been at an annual rate
    between 4% and 10% since 2001.

The IRS is currently examining Cadence’s federal income tax
    returns for the tax years 2006 through 2008.

Unrecognized
    Tax Benefits

Cadence takes a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring
    uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax
    position for recognition by determining if the weight of
    available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not
    that the tax position will be sustained upon audit, including
    resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The
    second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount
    that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon effective
    settlement.

The changes in Cadence’s gross amount of unrecognized tax
    benefits during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 are as follows:

The total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that, if upon
    resolution of the uncertain tax positions would reduce
    Cadence’s effective tax rate as of January 1, 2011 is
    $83.7 million as compared to $257.6 million as of
    January 2, 2010.

The total amounts of interest and penalties recognized in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 2010, fiscal
    2009 and fiscal 2008 as Provision (benefit) for income taxes are
    as follows:

$

The total amounts of gross accrued interest and penalties
    recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
    January 1, 2011, were $33.7 million and
    $15.3 million, respectively, as compared to
    $80.0 million and $10.8 million, respectively as of
    January 2, 2010.



Cadence believes that it is reasonably possible that the total
    amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to the IRS
    examination of its federal income tax returns for the tax years
    2003 through 2005 could decrease during fiscal 2011 if Cadence
    is able to effectively settle the disputed issues with the
    Appeals Office. Cadence cannot currently provide an estimate of
    the range of possible outcomes.

In addition, Cadence believes that it is reasonably possible
    that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits for its
    transfer pricing arrangements with its foreign subsidiaries
    could significantly increase or decrease during fiscal 2011 if
    the Appeals Office develops new settlement guidelines or adjusts
    its settlement positions that change Cadence’s measurement
    of the tax benefits to be recognized upon effective settlement
    with the IRS. Because of the uncertain impact of any potential
    settlement guidelines, Cadence cannot currently provide an
    estimate of the range of possible outcomes.

The calculation of Cadence’s provision (benefit) for income
    taxes requires significant judgment and involves dealing with
    uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and
    regulations. In determining the adequacy of the provision
    (benefit) for income taxes, Cadence regularly assesses the
    potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax
    examinations. However, the final outcome of tax examinations,
    including the total amount payable or the timing of any such
    payments upon resolution of these issues, cannot be estimated
    with certainty. In addition, Cadence cannot be certain that such
    amount will not be materially different from the amount that is
    reflected in its historical income tax provisions and accruals.
    Should the IRS or other tax authorities assess additional taxes
    as a result of a current or a future examination, Cadence may be
    required to record charges to operations in future periods that
    could have a material impact on its results of operations,
    financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or
    periods.

NOTE 7. RESTRUCTURING
    AND OTHER CHARGES

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, Cadence initiated a
    restructuring plan, or the 2010 Restructuring Plan, which it
    announced in February 2011. The 2010 Restructuring Plan is
    intended to decrease costs by reducing Cadence’s workforce
    and by consolidating facilities.

During fiscal 2010, Cadence recorded total Restructuring and
    other charges associated with the 2010 Restructuring Plan of
    $13.2 million, which includes $9.1 million of
    severance and employee-related costs, $3.7 million of
    asset-related costs and $0.4 million related to facilities
    consolidation costs.

During fiscal 2009, Cadence initiated a restructuring plan, or
    the 2009 Restructuring Plan. During fiscal 2008, Cadence
    initiated a restructuring plan, or the 2008 Restructuring Plan,
    and Cadence also initiated restructuring plans in each year from
    2001 through 2005, which are referred to as the Other
    Restructuring Plans. Cadence initiated the 2009 Restructuring
    Plan, 2008 Restructuring Plan, and Other Restructuring Plans,
    collectively known as the Restructuring Plans, in an effort to
    operate more efficiently.

As of January 1, 2011, Cadence’s total amount accrued
    for the Restructuring Plans was $15.1 million, consisting
    of $9.2 million of severance and severance-related benefits
    and $5.9 million of estimated lease losses. The estimated
    lease losses will be adjusted in the future based on changes in
    the assumptions used to estimate the lease losses. The lease
    losses could be as high as $9.1 million and will be
    influenced by rental rates and the amount of time it takes to
    find suitable tenants to sublease the facilities. Of the
    $15.1 million accrued as of January 1, 2011,
    $10.3 million was included in Accounts payable and accrued
    liabilities and $4.8 million was included in Other
    long-term liabilities on Cadence’s Consolidated Balance
    Sheet.

Cadence regularly evaluates the adequacy of its lease loss,
    severance and related benefits accruals, and adjusts the
    balances based on actual costs incurred or changes in estimates
    and assumptions. Cadence may incur future charges to reflect
    actual costs incurred or for changes in estimates related to
    amounts previously recorded under the Restructuring Plans.

    Restructuring Plan

During fiscal 2010, Cadence recorded Restructuring and other
    charges associated with the 2010 Restructuring Plan of
    $13.2 million. Of the $13.2 million, $9.1 million
    is comprised of estimated severance payments, severance-related
    benefits and costs for outplacement services that Cadence
    determined were both probable and estimable as



of January 1, 2011. The costs relate to approximately
    95 employees who were notified after January 1, 2011.
    All of the $9.1 million is included in Accounts payable and
    accrued liabilities in Cadence’s Consolidated Balance Sheet
    as of January 1, 2011. Because of varying regulations in
    the jurisdictions and countries in which Cadence operates, these
    workforce reductions will be realized during fiscal 2011 and are
    expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2011.

As part of the 2010 Restructuring Plan, Cadence determined it
    would change its development plans related to certain purchased
    software technology and related assets. Cadence evaluated the
    net realizable value of these assets and recorded an impairment
    charge of $3.5 million.

During fiscal 2010, and as part of the 2010 Restructuring Plan,
    Cadence recorded a lease loss accrual of $0.4 million
    related to a facility it consolidated prior to January 1,
    2011. Cadence expects to record up to an additional
    $1.0 million to $2.0 million in restructuring expenses
    related to consolidating facilities included in the 2010
    Restructuring Plan as it vacates those facilities in future
    periods.

The 2015 Notes Hedges and the 2015 Notes Embedded Conversion
    Derivative are classified as Level 2 because these assets
    and liabilities are not actively traded and are valued using
    standard pricing methodologies that use observable market data
    for all inputs. The fair value of the 2015 Notes Hedges and 2015
    Notes Embedded Conversion Derivative are determined using an
    option pricing model based on observable inputs, such as implied
    volatility of Cadence’s common stock, risk-free interest
    rate and other factors. The foreign currency exchange contracts
    are classified as Level 2 because the fair value of these
    contracts is determined based on observable foreign currency
    exchange rates.

Cadence acquired intangible assets of $171.0 million in
    connection with business combinations during fiscal 2010. The
    fair value of these intangible assets was estimated using
    Level 3 inputs. See Note 4 for an additional
    description of these business combinations and the key inputs
    used in the valuations.

Cadence recorded the initial fair value of contingent
    consideration liabilities in connection with a business
    combination during fiscal 2010, using Level 3 inputs. This
    liability is classified as Level 3 because this liability
    is measured at fair value using unobservable inputs at the end
    of each reporting period. See Note 4 for an additional
    description of this business combination and the key inputs used
    in the valuation.

The fair value of these financial assets and liabilities was

Cadence vacated or consolidated certain facilities in connection
    with restructuring plans initiated in 2009 and 2010 and recorded
    lease losses of $0.9 million during fiscal 2010, which are
    included in Restructuring and other charges (credits) in
    Cadence’s Consolidated Statement of Operations. The fair
    value of these lease losses was estimated using Level 3
    inputs. See Note 7 for an additional description of
    Cadence’s lease loss estimates.

Cadence determined during fiscal 2009 that certain of its
    non-marketable securities were

other-than-temporarily

impaired based on the current prices of similar non-marketable
    securities offered by the issuers. Cadence wrote down the
    investments by $5.2 million during fiscal 2009. These
    amounts are included in Other income (expense), net in
    Cadence’s Consolidated Statement of Operations. The fair
    value of these non-marketable securities was estimated using
    Level 3 inputs as described in Note 2.



Cadence determined during fiscal 2009 that certain of its
    property, plant and equipment was impaired and Cadence wrote
    down the property, plant and equipment to zero, resulting in a
    charge of $6.7 million. This charge is included throughout
    Cadence’s operating expenses in Cadence’s Consolidated
    Statement of Operations. The fair value of these impairments was
    estimated using Level 3 inputs as described in Note 2.

Marketable
    Securities

Cadence considers all of its investments in marketable equity
    securities as

available-for-sale.

Available-for-sale

equity securities are stated at fair value, with the unrealized
    gains and losses presented net of tax and reported as a separate
    component of Stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and
    losses are determined using the specific identification method.
    Gains are recognized when realized and are recorded in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations as Other income (expense),
    net. Losses are recognized as realized or when Cadence has
    determined that an

other-than-temporary

decline in fair value has occurred.

During fiscal 2010, certain non-marketable securities held by
    Cadence became marketable because the issuer completed an
    initial public offering, or IPO. Upon completion of this IPO,
    the issuer’s preferred stock held by



Cadence was converted to common stock and will be tradable in
    the open market upon the expiration of a

180-day

lock-up

period. Cadence reclassified the securities from non-marketable
    securities to marketable securities and recorded a gross
    unrealized holding gain of $8.0 million.

Net recognized gains (losses) from the sale of

available-for-sale

equity securities during fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal
    2008 were as follows:

During fiscal 2008, Cadence purchased approximately
    4.3 million shares of common stock of Mentor Graphics
    Corporation, or Mentor Graphics, in connection with its proposed
    acquisition of Mentor Graphics. After the announcement of
    Cadence’s withdrawal of the proposed acquisition of Mentor
    Graphics and during fiscal 2008, Cadence sold its entire equity
    interest in Mentor Graphics at a loss of $9.4 million,
    which is included in Losses on sale of

available-for-sale

securities in the table above.

It is Cadence’s policy to review the fair value of these
    marketable equity securities on a regular basis to determine
    whether its investments in these companies are

other-than-temporarily

impaired. This evaluation includes, but is not limited to,
    reviewing each company’s cash position, financing needs,
    earnings or revenue outlook, operational performance, management
    or ownership changes and competition. If Cadence believes the
    carrying value of an investment is in excess of its fair value,
    and this difference is

other-than-temporary,

it is Cadence’s policy to write down the investment to
    reduce its carrying value to fair value. These impairments are
    included in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated
    Statement of Operations. Cadence did not recognize an

other-than-temporary

impairment of

available-for-sale

equity securities during either fiscal 2010 or 2009. During
    fiscal 2008, Cadence determined that two of its

available-for-sale

equity securities were

other-than-temporarily

impaired based on the severity and the duration of the
    impairment and wrote down the investments by $8.1 million.

Non-Marketable
    Securities

Cadence uses either the cost or equity method of accounting to
    account for its long-term, non-marketable investment securities
    included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net
    realized gains on the sale of non-marketable investments were
    $4.9 million during fiscal 2010, zero during fiscal 2009
    and $1.6 million during fiscal 2008. If Cadence determines
    that an

other-than-temporary

decline exists in a non-marketable equity security, Cadence
    writes down the investment to its fair value and records the
    related write-down in Other income (expense), net, in
    Cadence’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The following table illustrates the carrying value of
    Cadence’s non-marketable securities as of January 1,
    2011 and January 2, 2010:

    during fiscal 2008. These write-downs are included in Other
    income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations.



Equity
    Method Investments

Cadence’s holdings in equity method investments are held in
    the form of voting preferred stock or convertible debt of
    privately-held companies. If Cadence determines that it has the
    ability to exercise significant influence over the issuer and
    the investment is in the form of in-substance common stock, the
    investment is accounted for under the equity method.

The portion of equity method income or loss recorded by Cadence
    is based on its percentage ownership of each issuer’s
    preferred stock or convertible debt available to absorb losses
    or with contractual rights to income. Cadence’s level of
    participation in future financings of its equity method issuers
    may impact its proportional share in future income or losses.
    Cadence records its interest in equity method gains and losses
    in the quarter following incurrence because it is not
    practicable to obtain issuer financial statements before the
    issuance of Cadence’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
    Cadence records its proportional share of the issuers’
    gains or losses in Other income (expense), net. Cadence’s
    proportional share of its issuers’ net losses and
    impairment losses was as follows:

    privately-held companies: Accent International S.A., GSR
    Associates II, L.P. and ZCIST Co., Ltd. As of January 1,
    2011, the difference between the carrying value of
    Cadence’s investments in these companies and Cadence’s
    share of the underlying net assets of the companies was
    immaterial. Subsequent to January 1, 2011, Cadence sold its
    interest in Accent International S.A.

NOTE 10. STOCK
    COMPENSATION PLANS

Equity
    Incentive Plans

Cadence’s 2000 Nonstatutory Equity Incentive Plan, or the
    2000 Plan, 1997 Nonstatutory Stock Incentive Plan, or 1997 Plan,
    and 1993 Nonstatutory Stock Incentive Plan, or 1993 Plan (the
    2000 Plan, the 1997 Plan and the 1993 Plan are referred to
    collectively as the Nonstatutory Stock Incentive Plans), provide
    for the issuance of non-qualified options, restricted stock
    awards, restricted stock units, stock bonuses and rights to
    acquire restricted stock to Cadence employees and consultants
    who are not executive officers of Cadence, members of the
    Cadence Board of Directors or beneficial owners of 10% or more
    of Cadence common stock at the time the grant is approved. The
    number of shares available for issuance under the 2000 Plan is
    50,000,000, under the 1997 Plan is 30,000,000 and under the 1993
    Plan is 24,750,000. Options granted under the Nonstatutory Stock
    Incentive Plans have an exercise price not less than the fair
    market value of the stock on the date of grant. Options granted
    to new employees become exercisable over a period of up to four
    years, generally with one-fourth of the shares vesting one year
    from the vesting commencement date, and the remaining shares
    vesting in 36 equal monthly installments thereafter. Options
    granted to current employees become exercisable over a period of
    up to four years, generally vesting in 48 equal monthly
    installments. Options granted under the Nonstatutory Stock
    Incentive Plans expire seven years from the date of grant.
    Restricted stock, which includes restricted stock awards and
    restricted stock units, granted under the Nonstatutory Stock
    Incentive Plans vest at times and in installments approved or
    delegated for approval by the Board of Directors or its
    Compensation Committee, on the basis of one or more of the
    following criteria: continued employment, passage of time or
    performance criteria.

Cadence’s 1987 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 1987 Plan,
    provides for the issuance of either incentive or non-qualified
    options and restricted stock awards. The number of shares
    available for issuance under the 1987 Plan is
    75,370,100 shares, of which only 5,000,000 shares may
    be issued pursuant to restricted stock awards. Options granted
    under the 1987 Plan have an exercise price not less than fair
    market value of the stock on the date of grant and become
    exercisable over periods of up to five years. Options granted
    under the 1987 Plan expire seven years from the date of grant.
    Restricted stock awards granted under the 1987 Plan vest at
    times and in installments set forth in the 1987 Plan and
    approved by the Board of Directors or its Compensation
    Committee, on the basis of one or more of the following
    criteria: continued employment, passage of time or performance
    criteria.

Under the 1995 Directors’ Stock Option Plan, or the
    Directors’ Plan, Cadence may grant non-qualified options to
    its non-employee directors for up to 3,050,000 shares of
    common stock at an exercise price equal to the average of the
    closing price for 20 trading days prior to the grant date.
    Options granted under the Directors’ Plan have terms of ten
    years and vest one year from the date of grant.

Cadence has assumed certain options granted to employees of
    acquired companies, or Acquired Options. The Acquired Options
    were assumed by Cadence outside of its stock option plans, and
    each option is administered under the terms of the respective
    original plans of the acquired companies. All of the Acquired
    Options have been adjusted for the price conversion under the
    terms of the acquisition agreement between Cadence and the
    relevant acquired company. The Acquired Options generally become
    exercisable over a four or five year period and generally expire
    between five and ten years from the date of grant. No additional
    options will be granted under any of the acquired
    companies’ plans.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)

In November 1998, Cadence’s Board of Directors adopted, and
    the Cadence stockholders subsequently approved, Cadence’s
    Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which amended
    and restated the 1990 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the ESPP.
    Subsequent amendments approved by Cadence’s Board of
    Directors and Cadence stockholders increased the number of
    shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the ESPP to
    66,500,000 shares.

Under the ESPP and through the January 31, 2009 purchase
    date, a majority of Cadence’s employees could purchase
    Cadence’s common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower
    of the fair market value at the beginning of the applicable
    offering period or at the end of the applicable offering period,
    in an amount up to 12% of their annual base earnings plus
    bonuses and commissions, subject to a limit in any calendar year
    of $25,000 worth of common



stock. The offering periods are six months with a corresponding
    six month purchase period. New offerings begin on each
    February 1st and August 1st, and those offerings
    run consecutively. The purchase dates under the ESPP are
    January 31st and July 31st of each year.

Cadence’s Board of Directors administers the ESPP and has
    the final authority to construe and interpret both the ESPP and
    the rights granted under it. Cadence’s Board of Directors
    also has the authority, subject to the provisions of the ESPP,
    to determine when and how the rights to purchase Cadence common
    stock will be granted and the provisions of each offering of
    these rights, including designating any limits on the percentage
    and dollar amount that may be withheld from the ESPP
    participants’ annual gross earnings for a particular
    offering period, and Cadence’s Board of Directors may
    modify such limits from time to time. Under the rules currently
    in effect under the ESPP: (i) for the offering period that
    commenced February 1, 2009, each eligible ESPP participant
    was entitled to purchase Cadence common stock in an amount not
    to exceed the lower of (A) $7,058.82 or (B) the
    difference between (x) $25,000 and (y) the aggregate
    amount of Cadence’s common stock such participant purchased
    on January 30, 2009 under the ESPP; and (ii) for the
    offering period that commenced August 1, 2009 and
    thereafter, each eligible ESPP participant would be entitled to
    purchase Cadence common stock in an amount not to exceed
    $7,058.82 in any calendar year, subject to a contribution limit
    of 5% of such participant’s gross annual earnings.

In October 2008, certain executive officers resigned from their
    positions at Cadence. Pursuant to the resignations and the terms
    of the respective employment agreements of these executive
    officers, stock options have either been accelerated or
    forfeited. Cadence recorded additional stock-based compensation
    expense of $6.5 million relating to the accelerated vesting
    of these stock options during fiscal 2008.

Restricted
    Stock and Stock Bonuses

Generally, restricted stock, which includes restricted stock
    awards and restricted stock units, vests over three to four
    years and is subject to the employee’s continuing service
    to Cadence. Cadence issues some of its restricted



stock with performance-based vesting. The terms of these
    restricted stock grants are consistent with grants of restricted
    stock described above, with the exception that the vesting of
    the shares depends not only upon the completion of the required
    period of service, but also on the satisfaction of certain
    predetermined performance goals. Each quarterly period, Cadence
    estimates the probability of the achievement of these
    performance goals and recognizes any related stock-based
    compensation expense. The amount of stock-based compensation
    expense recognized in any one period can vary based on the
    attainment or estimated attainment of the various performance
    goals. If such performance goals are not met, no compensation
    expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation
    expense is reversed.

In July 2008, Cadence modified the performance goals related to
    its performance-based restricted stock. On the modification
    date, Cadence evaluated the probability of achievement of both
    the original performance goals and the modified performance
    goals. For the performance-based restricted stock in which the
    original performance goal was unlikely to be achieved, Cadence
    reversed the previously recorded stock-based compensation
    expense of $6.5 million, calculated the fair value of the
    restricted stock on the modification date, and recorded the
    stock-based compensation expense to the extent that the modified
    performance goals were expected to be achieved over the
    remaining weighted average requisite service period of
    1.0 years. The fair value of the modified performance-based
    restricted stock was $6.2 million, or $7.34 per share. In
    the case of performance-based restricted stock grants for which
    both the original performance goal and the modified performance
    goal were determined to be likely to be achieved, the original
    grant date fair value will continue to be recorded as
    stock-based compensation expense as if no modification had
    occurred.

In October 2008, certain executive officers resigned from their
    positions with Cadence. As a result of those resignations and
    the terms of the respective employment agreements of those
    executive officers, the performance-based restricted stock
    either was forfeited or will be subject to vesting according to
    the terms of those agreements. Cadence recorded additional
    stock-based compensation expense relating to accelerated vesting
    of certain portions of some of the affected performance-based
    restricted stock, which was partially offset by the reversal of
    previously recorded stock-based compensation expense relating to
    the performance-based restricted stock that were forfeited.
    Cadence also recorded an additional expense related to the
    acceleration of restricted stock that was not performance-based
    in connection with the executive officer resignations.

Stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based
    restricted stock grants for fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal
    2008 was as follows:

Liability-based
    Awards

Cadence maintains a performance-based bonus plan under which
    payments may be made in Cadence common stock or cash. Each
    quarterly period, Cadence estimates the most likely outcome of
    predetermined performance goals and recognizes any related
    stock-based compensation expense. The amount of stock-based
    compensation expense recognized in any one period can vary based
    on the attainment or estimated attainment of the various
    performance goals. If such performance goals are not met, no
    compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized
    compensation expense is reversed. The dollar amount earned under
    this performance-based bonus plan is based on the achievement of
    the performance goals, and the number of shares to be issued
    under the performance-based bonus plan is based on the dollar
    amounts earned and the average stock price for three days
    preceding the grant date. Stock issued under the
    performance-based bonus plan vests immediately. Cadence agreed
    to make the fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 payments in
    cash under this performance-based bonus plan. The final payment
    under this performance-based bonus plan was made in February
    2010. Stock-based compensation expense and cash paid related to
    this performance-based bonus plan for fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009
    and fiscal 2008 were as follows:

NOTE 13. NET
    INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE

Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net
    income (loss) during the period by the weighted average number
    of shares of common stock outstanding, less unvested restricted
    stock awards. None of Cadence’s outstanding grants of
    restricted stock contain nonforfeitable dividend rights. Diluted
    net income per share is impacted by equity instruments
    considered to be potential common shares, if dilutive, computed
    using the treasury stock method of accounting. In periods in
    which a net loss is recorded, potentially dilutive equity
    instruments would decrease the loss per share and therefore are
    not added to the weighted average shares outstanding for the
    diluted net loss per share calculation.

Cadence accounts for the effect of the Convertible Senior Notes
    in the diluted net income per share calculation using the
    if-converted method of accounting under the assumption that the
    conversion spread, if any, will be settled in stock. Under that
    method, the only shares that will be considered for inclusion in
    diluted net income per share are



those relating to the excess of the conversion premium over the
    principal amount. During fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal
    2008, no shares are included in diluted net income per share for
    the Convertible Senior Notes.

The calculations for basic and diluted net income (loss) per
    share for fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 are as
    follows:

NOTE 15. CONTINGENCIES

Legal
    Proceedings

From time to time, Cadence is involved in various disputes and
    litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business. These
    include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property,
    indemnification obligations, mergers and acquisitions,
    licensing, contracts, distribution arrangements and employee
    relations matters. At least quarterly, Cadence reviews the
    status of each significant matter and assesses its potential
    financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or
    legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount or the
    range of loss can be estimated, Cadence accrues a liability for
    the estimated loss. Legal proceedings are subject to
    uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to predict.
    Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based on
    Cadence’s judgments using the best information available at
    the time. As additional information becomes available, Cadence
    reassesses the potential liability related to pending claims and
    litigation matters and may revise estimates.

During fiscal 2008, three complaints were filed in the United
    States District Court for the Northern District of California,
    or District Court, all alleging violations of
    Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
    1934, or the Exchange Act, and

Rule 10b-5

promulgated thereunder, on behalf of a purported class of
    purchasers of Cadence’s common stock. The first such
    complaint was filed on October 29, 2008, captioned
    Hu v. Cadence Design Systems, Inc., Michael J. Fister,
    William Porter and Kevin S. Palatnik; the second such complaint
    was filed on November 4, 2008, captioned Vyas v.
    Cadence Design Systems, Inc., Michael J. Fister, and Kevin S.
    Palatnik; and the third such complaint was filed on
    November 21, 2008, captioned Collins v. Cadence Design
    Systems, Inc., Michael J. Fister, John B. Shoven, Kevin S.
    Palatnik and William Porter. On March 4, 2009, the District
    Court



entered an order consolidating these three complaints and
    captioning the consolidated case “In re Cadence Design
    Systems, Inc. Securities Litigation.” The District Court
    also named a lead plaintiff and lead counsel for the
    consolidated litigation. The lead plaintiff filed its
    consolidated amended complaint on April 24, 2009, naming
    Cadence, Michael J. Fister, Kevin S. Palatnik, William Porter
    and Kevin Bushby as defendants, and alleging violations of
    Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and

Rule 10b-5

promulgated thereunder, on behalf of a purported class of
    purchasers of Cadence’s common stock who traded
    Cadence’s common stock between April 23, 2008 and
    December 10, 2008, or the Alleged Class Period. The
    amended complaint alleged that Cadence and the individual
    defendants made statements during the Alleged Class Period
    regarding Cadence’s financial results that were false and
    misleading because Cadence had recognized revenue that should
    have been recognized in subsequent periods. The amended
    complaint requested certification of the action as a class
    action, unspecified damages, interest and costs, and unspecified
    equitable relief. On June 8, 2009, Cadence and the other
    defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On
    September 11, 2009, the District Court held that the
    plaintiffs had failed to allege a valid claim under the relevant
    legal standards, and granted the defendants’ motion to
    dismiss the amended complaint. The District Court gave the
    plaintiffs leave to file another amended complaint, and the
    plaintiffs did so on October 13, 2009. The amended
    complaint filed on October 13, 2009 names the same
    defendants, asserts the same causes of action, and seeks the
    same relief as the earlier amended complaint. Cadence moved to
    dismiss the October 13, 2009 amended complaint. The
    District Court denied the motion to dismiss on March 2,
    2010. On July 7, 2010, the parties agreed, and the District
    Court ordered, that the litigation be stayed in order to
    facilitate mediation. On February 11, 2011, the parties to
    the litigation agreed to settle the litigation for consideration
    of $38.0 million, of which approximately $22.2 million
    will be paid by Cadence’s insurers, while the balance will
    be paid by Cadence. Cadence agreed to this settlement without
    admitting any wrongdoing on the part of the company or any of
    its current or former directors and executive officers, and the
    settlement is subject to completion of final settlement
    documentation by the parties and approval by the District Court.

During fiscal 2008, two derivative complaints were filed in
    Santa Clara County Superior Court, or Superior Court. The
    first was filed on November 20, 2008, and captioned Ury
    Priel, derivatively on behalf of nominal defendant Cadence
    Design Systems, Inc. v. John B. Shoven, Lip-Bu Tan, Alberto
    Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, Donald L. Lucas, Sr., Roger
    Siboni, George Scalise, Michael J. Fister, and Doe Defendants
    1-15. The second was filed on December 1, 2008, and
    captioned Mark Levine, derivatively on behalf of nominal
    defendant Cadence Design Systems, Inc. v. John B. Shoven,
    Lip-Bu Tan, Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, Donald L.
    Lucas, Sr., Roger Siboni, George Scalise, Michael J.
    Fister, John Swainson and Doe Defendants 1-10. These complaints
    purport to bring suit derivatively, on behalf of Cadence,
    against certain of Cadence’s current and former directors
    for alleged breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross
    mismanagement, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment.
    Many of the allegations underlying these claims are similar or
    identical to the allegations in the consolidated securities
    class action lawsuits described above, and the claims also
    include allegations that the individual defendants approved
    compensation based on inflated financial results. The plaintiffs
    request unspecified damages, restitution, equitable relief and
    their reasonable attorneys’ fees, experts’ fees, costs
    and expenses on behalf of Cadence against the individual
    defendants. A motion to consolidate these complaints was granted
    on January 20, 2009, and the cases were captioned “In
    re Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Derivative Litigation.” The
    consolidated cases were then stayed by agreement of the parties.
    The plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended derivative complaint
    on June 1, 2010. The consolidated amended derivative
    complaint names as defendants Cadence (as a nominal defendant),
    James S. Miller, R.L. Smith McKeithen, John B. Shoven, Lip-Bu
    Tan, Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, Donald L. Lucas, Sr.,
    Roger S. Siboni, George Scalise, Michael J. Fister, John A.C.
    Swainson, Kevin S. Palatnik, William Porter, and Kevin Bushby.
    The consolidated amended derivative complaint alleges purported
    causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control,
    gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, and unjust
    enrichment (which is asserted against certain defendants). Many
    of the factual allegations of the consolidated amended
    derivative complaint are similar to those alleged in the First
    Amended Complaint in the securities class action case described
    above. In addition, the claims include allegations that the
    director defendants made inappropriate personnel decisions with
    respect to the former officers and that the former officers were
    unjustly enriched. The consolidated derivative complaint seeks
    unspecified monetary damages and equitable relief, disgorgement
    of profits and compensation, and costs and attorneys’ fees.

On April 28, 2010, a derivative complaint was filed in the
    District Court, captioned Walter Hamilton, derivatively on
    behalf of nominal defendant Cadence Design Systems, Inc. v.
    Michael J. Fister, William Porter,



James S. Miller, Jr., Kevin Bushby, R.L. Smith McKeithen,
    Lip-Bu Tan, Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, John B. Shoven,
    Donald L. Lucas, George M. Scalise, Roger S. Siboni, John A.C.
    Swainson, and KPMG LLP. This complaint purports to bring suit
    derivatively, on behalf of Cadence, against certain of
    Cadence’s current and former officers and directors for
    breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement,
    and waste of corporate assets, against the former executive
    defendants for unjust enrichment, and against Cadence’s
    independent auditors for professional negligence and breach of
    contract. Many of the allegations underlying these claims are
    similar or identical to the allegations in the consolidated
    securities class action lawsuits described above. In addition,
    the claims include allegations that the director defendants made
    inappropriate personnel decisions with respect to the former
    officers and that the former officers were unjustly enriched, as
    well as allegations that Cadence’s independent auditors
    performed allegedly inadequate audits. The complaint seeks
    unspecified monetary relief, injunctive relief relating to
    certain corporate governance matters, and attorneys’ costs
    and fees. On June 28, 2010, the plaintiff dismissed
    Cadence’s independent auditors from the case, without
    prejudice.

On August 17, 2010, two complaints were filed in the
    District Court: one captioned George Powers, derivatively on
    behalf of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. v. Michael J.
    Fister, Kevin Bushby, R.L. Smith McKeithen, James S.
    Miller, Jr., William Porter, James J. Cowie, Kevin S.
    Palatnik, John B. Shoven, PhD, Donald L. Lucas and Roger S.
    Siboni; the other captioned Arash Samani, derivatively on behalf
    of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. v. Michael J. Fister, Kevin
    Bushby, R.L. Smith McKeithen, James S. Miller, Jr., William
    Porter, James J. Cowie, Kevin S. Palatnik, John B. Shoven, PhD,
    Donald L. Lucas and Roger S. Siboni. These complaints are
    virtually identical to one another, and purport to bring suit
    derivatively, on behalf of Cadence, against certain of
    Cadence’s current and former officers and directors for
    breach of fiduciary duty. Many of the allegations underlying
    this claim are similar or identical to the allegations in the
    consolidated securities class action lawsuits described above.
    The complaints seek unspecified monetary and equitable relief,
    as well as attorneys’ fees and costs.

These cases were stayed while the parties participated in the
    mediation process. On February 8, 2011, the parties to
    these derivative cases agreed to settle all of them in exchange
    for certain corporate governance changes that Cadence has agreed
    to put in place, along with an agreement not to oppose an
    application by plaintiffs’ counsel to the Court for an
    attorneys’ fee of $1.8 million, which will be paid by
    Cadence’s insurers if the fee is approved by the court.
    Cadence agreed to this settlement without admitting any
    wrongdoing on the part of the company or any of its current or
    former directors and executive officers, and this settlement is
    subject to completion of final settlement documentation by the
    parties and court approval.

Other
    Contingencies

Cadence provides its customers with a warranty on sales of
    hardware products, generally for a

90-day

period. Cadence did not incur any significant costs related to
    warranty obligations during fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal
    2008.

Cadence’s product license and services agreements typically
    include a limited indemnification provision for claims from
    third parties relating to Cadence’s intellectual property.
    If the potential loss from any indemnification claim is
    considered probable and the amount or the range of loss can be
    estimated, Cadence accrues a liability for the estimated loss.
    The indemnification is generally limited to the amount paid by
    the customer. To date, Cadence has not accrued a liability for
    any potential losses from indemnification claims.

Cadence has purchase obligations of $44.5 million as of
    January 1, 2011 that are associated with agreements for
    purchases of goods or services.



NOTE 16. LEASE
    COMMITMENTS

Equipment and facilities are leased under various operating
    leases expiring at various dates through 2025. Certain of these
    leases contain renewal options. Rental expense is recognized on
    a straight-line basis and was $21.8 million for fiscal
    2010, $27.3 million for fiscal 2009 and $34.7 million
    for fiscal 2008.

As of January 1, 2011, future minimum lease payments under

NOTE 17. SALES
    OF INSTALLMENT CONTRACT RECEIVABLES

During 2008 and 2009, Cadence transferred installment contract
    receivables on a non-recourse or limited-recourse basis to third
    party financial institutions and these transfers were recorded
    as sales. The following table shows the amounts of accounts
    receivable transferred to financial institutions on a
    non-recourse basis during fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal
    2008:

Losses on the sale of receivables are included in General and

    purchasing financial institution’s review of the credit
    strength of the customers whose installment contract receivables
    are being transferred by Cadence. The following table presents

When Cadence sells receivables, it generally retains the
    servicing rights to the underlying accounts receivable. The fair
    value of the retained servicing rights has not been material to
    Cadence’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

During fiscal 2008, Cadence executed a transaction that was not
    deemed a true sale and Cadence was not able to record this
    transaction as a sale. Accordingly, Cadence recorded a liability
    of $18.0 million due to the financial institution in its
    Consolidated Balance Sheet and the cash received from the
    financial institution during fiscal 2008 and the cash repaid to
    the financial institution during fiscal 2009 are included as
    Cash flows from financing activities in the Consolidated
    Statement of Cash Flows.



NOTE 18. EMPLOYEE
    AND DIRECTOR BENEFIT PLANS

Cadence maintains a 401(k) savings plan to provide retirement
    benefits through tax-deferred salary deductions for all of its
    United States employees. Cadence may make discretionary
    contributions, as determined by the Board of Directors, which
    cannot exceed a specified percentage of the annual aggregate
    salaries of those employees eligible to participate. Cadence
    made total contributions to the plan of $8.8 million in
    2010, $9.0 million in 2009 and $12.2 million in 2008.

Executive Officers and Directors may also elect to defer
    compensation payable to them under Cadence’s 1994
    Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan. Deferred compensation
    payments are held in accounts with values indexed to the
    performance of selected investments. These investments are
    classified as trading securities in Cadence’s Consolidated
    Balance Sheets and gains and losses are recognized as income
    (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net
    recognized gains (losses) of trading securities during fiscal
    2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 were as follows:

Certain of Cadence’s international subsidiaries sponsor

    benefit obligation for Cadence’s defined benefit plans was
    $8.0 million as of January 1, 2011 and
    $2.0 million as of January 2, 2010, and is recorded in

NOTE 21. SEGMENT
    REPORTING

Segment reporting requires disclosures of certain information
    regarding reportable segments, products and services, geographic
    areas of operation and major customers. Segment reporting is
    based on the “management approach”: how management
    organizes the company’s reportable segments for which
    separate financial information is (i) available and
    (ii) evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision
    maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing
    performance. Cadence’s chief operating decision maker is
    its President and Chief Executive Officer, or CEO.
    Cadence’s CEO reviews Cadence’s consolidated results
    as one reportable segment. In making operating decisions, the
    CEO primarily considers consolidated financial information,
    accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by
    geographic region.

Outside the United States, Cadence markets and supports its
    products and services primarily through its subsidiaries.
    Revenue is attributed to geography based on the country in which
    the product is used or services are delivered. Long-lived assets
    are attributed to geography based on the country where the
    assets are located.
