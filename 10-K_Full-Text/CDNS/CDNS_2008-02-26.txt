Factors
    Driving the Electronic Design Automation Industry

Communications, computing and consumer electronics markets drove
    the growth in the electronics industry for most of the past
    decade. However, in recent years, the consumer market has been
    the fastest growing end market for electronics and the most
    influential in setting requirements for time-to-market, low
    cost, miniaturization and increasing functionality. These market
    and technology forces pose major challenges for the global
    electronics design community.

During 2007, we saw increasing pressures on research and
    development budgets in our customer base, due to the
    deceleration of growth in the electronics equipment and
    semiconductor industries and a deteriorating macroeconomic
    environment. Semiconductor volumes grew during 2007, fueled by
    strong consumer demand in traditional and emerging markets, but
    at the same time average selling prices declined.

Electronic systems companies respond to demand for increased
    functionality and miniaturization by combining
    subsystems – such as radio frequency wireless
    communication, or RF, video signal processing, and



microprocessors – onto a single silicon chip, creating
    a

system-on-chip,

or SoC, or multiple chips into a single chip package in a format
    referred to as

system-in-package,

or SiP. These trends toward subsystem integration have required
    chip makers to find solutions to challenges previously addressed
    by system companies, such as verifying system-level
    functionality and hardware-software interoperability.

SoC designs put many more transistors on each chip, increasing
    the need for tight control over power consumption. This is done
    not only to increase battery life in portable devices, but also
    to minimize energy cost for computing and networking equipment.
    Higher power devices generate more heat, which further increases
    both system cost as well as operating expenses for cooling.
    Evolving semiconductor manufacturing processes with smaller
    features (transistors and wires) and lower supply voltages
    address both of these issues to some degree, but introduce new
    challenges of their own. Contemporary portable electronic
    devices contain chips in which individual features can be as
    small as 45 nanometers – 45/1,000,000ths of a
    millimeter. Because of the electrical characteristics of the
    materials used to construct the transistors (which are
    essentially microscopic switches), chips continue to consume
    power even when transistors in the device are switched off. To
    overcome these and other power-related issues, specific
    “low power” design techniques must be developed and
    are most effective if they are integrated throughout the design
    flow, from logic design and verification through physical
    implementation.

Variability in the processes and materials used to manufacture
    silicon chips have become so pervasive at 65 nanometers and
    below that traditional connections between design and
    manufacturing teams are insufficient to ensure chip performance
    and yield. Integrating detailed models of the manufacturing
    process into the chip design environment is desirable so
    engineers can craft the design to avoid or overcome these
    manufacturing process variations. Similarly, manufacturing teams
    can optimize their processes if, along with the design, they are
    provided with information about the most critical parts of the
    chip. However, sharing information between design and
    manufacturing processes is complicated because current data
    formats used to describe the chip design differ from data
    formats used to describe the manufacturing process and control
    the manufacturing equipment. Moreover, design and manufacturing
    often take place within two or more separate companies, since
    multiple companies may participate in the design of the chip,
    and multiple companies may participate in the manufacturing and
    assembly of the final device.

These trends represent significant new challenges for
    electronics design processes. Specifically, product performance
    and size requirements of the mobile consumer electronics market
    require microelectronic systems to be smaller, consume less
    power and provide multiple functions all in one SoC or SiP
    package. This requires designers to pay close attention to many
    electrical, physical and manufacturing effects that were
    inconsequential in previous generations of chip designs. The
    design challenge becomes more complex with each new generation
    of electronics, and providers of EDA solutions must deliver
    products that address these technical challenges, while
    improving the efficiency and productivity of the design process.

Operating
    Segment

Our chief operating decision maker is our President and Chief
    Executive Officer, or CEO. Our CEO reviews our consolidated
    results within only one operating segment.

Products

Our products are engineered to improve our customers’
    design productivity and resulting design quality by providing a
    comprehensive set of EDA design tools. Product revenues include
    all fees earned from granting licenses to use our software, and
    from sales and leases of our hardware products, and exclude
    revenues derived from maintenance and services. We offer
    customers three license types for our software: perpetual, term
    and subscription. See “Software Licensing
    Arrangements” below for additional discussion of our
    license types.

Product revenue was $1,104.0 million, or 68% of our total
    revenue, in 2007, $982.7 million, or 66% of our total
    revenue, in 2006 and $851.5 million, or 64% of our total
    revenue, in 2005.

Product
    Strategy

With the addition of emerging nanometer design considerations to
    the already burgeoning set of traditional design tasks, complex
    SoC or IC design can no longer be accomplished using a
    collection of discrete design tools. What previously consisted
    of sequential design activities must be merged and accomplished
    nearly simultaneously without time-consuming data translation
    steps. We combine our design technologies into
    “platforms” for four major



design activities: functional verification, digital IC design,
    custom IC design and system interconnect design. The four
    Cadence

®

design platforms are
    Incisive

®

functional verification,
    Encounter

®

digital IC design,
    Virtuoso

®

custom design and
    Allegro

®

system interconnect design platforms. In addition, we augment
    these platform product offerings with a comprehensive set of
    design for manufacturing, or DFM, products that service both the
    digital and custom IC design flows. These four platforms,
    together with our DFM products, comprise our primary product
    lines.

In order to provide our customers with products that are
    optimized and scaled to their specific project requirements, we
    introduced three product tiers. The “L” tier provides
    competitive technology for mainstream design projects. The
    “XL” tier is differentiated for more complex and
    leading edge design projects. The “GXL” tier is highly
    differentiated to address the most complex and challenging
    design projects in the industry.

Incisive
    Functional Verification Platform

The Incisive functional verification platform enables our
    customers to employ enterprise-level verification process
    automation, including verification planning, management and
    process tracking, with coordination of all verification
    activities across teams of specialists and different execution
    platforms.

The Incisive platform is tailored for three customer segments:

•

Logic design engineers using traditional hardware description
    languages and testing techniques;

•

Logic design teams that are also responsible for verification
    and need more automation; and

•

Multi-specialist enterprise teams comprised of logic design
    engineers, dedicated verification engineers, software
    development engineers and system validation engineers.

The Incisive platform includes verification process automation
    technologies, methodologies, and verification intellectual
    property, or VIP, for many standard protocols. The Incisive
    platform is comprised of the following core solutions:

•

The Incisive Management solution, which automates and guides the
    verification process and then analyzes data, from planning to
    closure;

•

The Incisive Simulation Analysis solution, which offers

mixed-language

testbench support, dynamic assertion checking, transaction-level
    support, hardware description language, or HDL, analysis and a
    complete debug environment;

•

The Incisive Formal solution, which improves productivity
    starting at the designer’s desktop, providing a formal
    means of verifying register transfer level, or RTL, functional
    correctness with assertions, without the need of testbench
    simulation, resulting in fast RTL block

bring-up;

•

The Incisive Verification IP, which improves productivity while
    reducing project risks associated with standard protocol
    compliance, providing a catalogue of the most popular standard
    protocols equipped with a Compliance Management System; and

•

The
    Palladium

®

and
    Xtreme

®

series of emulation and acceleration hardware solutions, which
    accelerate the verification process and enable first working
    silicon with first working software.

The Incisive Plan-to-Closure methodology and the SoC Functional
    Verification Kit are designed to enable the scalable deployment
    of best practices by our technical field experts and to mitigate
    our customers’ language, technology and methodology
    adoption risks.

Encounter
    Digital IC Design Platform

The Encounter digital IC design platform enables our customers
    to implement all aspects of their digital nanometer-scale
    designs. It is based on a single user interface and unified
    in-memory data model, and is specifically designed to facilitate
    the analysis and optimization of chip performance, power
    consumption, and silicon area and manufacturability throughout
    our customers’ design processes. The Encounter platform is
    comprised of the following core technologies:

•

Silicon virtual prototyping for enabling designers to plan the
    complete implementation of a chip before committing to a
    specific design strategy;

•

Global RTL and physical synthesis for creating and physically
    locating logic on the chip, while simultaneously optimizing
    performance, power, cost and yield;



•

Signal integrity and yield-aware routing for connecting high
    performance physical interconnect between the logic gates;

•

Signal integrity and nanometer delay analysis;

•

Comprehensive design-for-test capability as well as post-silicon
    test diagnostics; and

•

Logic equivalence checking and design constraint management
    capability for designers to verify that their RTL specification
    is equivalent to the final IC layout.

Unlike traditional “front-end/back-end” systems, the
    Encounter platform does not require customers to perform
    time-consuming translations between common tasks such as
    placement, power distribution, routing, and timing and crosstalk
    analysis. The Encounter platform supports hierarchical designs,
    with support for designs containing hundreds of millions of
    transistors on a single chip. Since 2005, the Encounter platform
    has been marketed in three tiers: Encounter L, XL and GXL. These
    tiers are scaled to provide customers with technologies tailored
    to specific degrees of design complexity in the digital IC space.

Virtuoso
    Custom Design Platform

The Virtuoso custom design platform provides designers with an
    integrated solution for design creation, validation and
    implementation of silicon-accurate analog, custom digital,
    mixed-signal and RF designs, while ensuring that these designs
    are ready for manufacturing, through our integrated DFM
    capabilities.

The Virtuoso platform reduces design time by providing:

•

Reference flows for analog, mixed-signal, RF and analog-digital
    integration focused at the wireless and analog/mixed-signal
    markets;

•

Automatic analog circuit sizing and optimization (including
    yield optimization);

•

Multi-mode simulation (digital, analog, mixed-signal and RF)
    using a common syntax and model, and common equations;

•

Fast custom layout technologies;

•

Process migration technology;

•

Electrical vs. physical effects analysis; and

•

Physical design integration and silicon analysis for complex
    custom, cell-based and mixed custom designs.

The latest Virtuoso 6.1.0 release provides a unified design
    environment tying together the design, layout, and verification
    tasks based on innovative constraint-driven design capabilities,
    which significantly improve our customers’ productivity.
    The end-to-end simulation and verification technology called
    “multi-mode simulation” is integrated into the unified
    environment enabling a complete design-to-verification
    methodology.

The Virtuoso 6.1.0 platform relies on the
    OpenAccess

tm

database (described below in “Third Party Programs and
    Initiatives”), which provides a common foundation for the
    designers as they move through the design cycle and is also a
    mechanism to interoperate with applications developed by
    partners and customers.

The Virtuoso L, XL and GXL offerings provide designers the
    ability to choose the right products to match their needs for
    custom design ranging from the simplest entry-level component
    design to the most complex DFM-aware SoC designs.

Allegro
    System Interconnect Design Platform

The Allegro system interconnect design platform enables design
    teams to design high-performance electronic products across the
    domains of IC, package and printed circuit board, or PCB,
    reducing cost and time to market. The system
    interconnect – between input-output buffers and across
    ICs, packages and PCBs – can be optimized through the
    platform’s co-design methodology, reducing both hardware
    costs and design cycles. Designers use the Allegro
    platform’s constraint-driven methodology and advanced
    capabilities for design capture, signal integrity and physical
    implementation. Silicon design-in kits speed time to market by
    allowing IC companies to shorten new device adoption time and
    allowing systems companies to accelerate PCB system design
    cycles. In 2007, we shipped our next generation PCB design
    products that include our new global route environment
    technology as part of the Allegro 16.0 release. We also expanded
    sales of our IC Packaging and SiP products. The Allegro family
    products are marketed in three product tiers: Allegro L, XL and
    GXL.



The system interconnect design product group includes the
    Allegro system interconnect design platform, the
    OrCAD

®

product line of PCB design products which are engineered for
    individual or small design team productivity and a family of IC
    packaging and SiP technologies. The OrCAD product line is
    marketed worldwide through a network of resellers.

Design for Manufacturing

With the advent of finer geometries in silicon manufacturing
    technologies (65 nanometer, 45 nanometer and below),
    semiconductor companies are increasingly concerned about
    manufacturability of their designs. The physical layout of each
    IC requires detailed analysis and optimization to ensure that
    the design can be manufactured in volume while performing as
    expected.

Cadence’s strategy is to integrate silicon foundry-endorsed
    model-based manufacturability analysis and sign-off into the
    proven IC design implementation flows from both the Virtuoso as
    well as the Encounter platforms. The benefits of this integrated
    manufacturability design flow include reduction of catastrophic
    and parametric yield issues and enablement of design
    implementation for maximized performance.

Some of our products that deliver DFM capabilities for nanometer
    SoC design include:

•

QRC, Fire &
    Ice

®

QX and
    Assura

®

RCX parasitic extraction products, which take the
    designer’s physical representation of an IC and extract the
    electrical properties of that design representation to enable
    further analyses, such as simulation and timing analysis;

•

Products in the
    VoltageStorm

®

family analyze on-chip power distribution for digital, analog
    and SoC designs. VoltageStorm detects unanticipated voltage
    drop, enabling the customer to correct fatal conditions, thereby
    preventing extensive troubleshooting and delay during initial
    manufacturing;

•

Our physical verification products, including Cadence Physical
    Verification System, or PVS, Assura,
    Diva

®

and
    Dracula

®

,
    which perform manufacturing design rule checks to ensure the
    proposed design meets the requirements of the foundry’s
    manufacturing process rules;

•

Mask data preparation tools, such as MaskCompose and QuickView,
    which help customer mask shops create mask and reticle layouts
    for chips being manufactured in nanometer processes;

•

Cadence CMP Predictor, which helps designers to understand the
    impact of chemical-mechanical polishing, or CMP, one of the
    major steps in the semiconductor manufacturing process, which
    potentially impacts the chip performance at advanced silicon
    geometries;

•

Litho Physical Analyzer and Litho Electrical Analyzer, both
    lithography analysis tools for physical and electrical effects,
    which offer silicon foundry endorsed model-based layout
    printability and electrical variation analysis tools;

•

Advanced pattern synthesis tools for next generation optical and
    process proximity correction of layouts targeted for finer
    geometries, especially extremely dense layouts such as full chip
    memory designs; and

•

Other products for random yield analysis as well as chip failure
    diagnostics.

Kits

Today’s growing silicon complexity creates an array of
    design challenges for semiconductor and systems design teams.
    Among these challenges is the application of EDA technologies to
    overcome design hurdles in certain key markets driving the
    semiconductor industry, such as the wireless and networking
    segments. Cadence kits are designed to allow companies in these
    sectors to achieve shorter, more predictable design cycles and
    greater design productivity by greatly simplifying the
    application and integration of EDA technologies to address major
    design challenges in the analog mixed-signal, RF, SiP, low power
    and SoC functional verification markets.

A Cadence kit assembles technologies from our broad portfolio
    into ready-to-use design flows, enhanced by application specific
    design methodologies, expert knowledge, and best practices, and
    applied to a segment representative IC design. The kits
    accelerate the adoption of latest design methodologies and offer
    customers improved productivity. In 2007, we introduced the Low
    Power Kit and the SoC Functional Verification Kit.

Verification
    and Application-Specific Programming Services

We offer verification and application-specific programming, or
    ASP, services, which provide customers with consulting services,
    project services

and/or

complete turnkey services for verification acceleration and
    system



emulation. QuickCycles allows customers access to our Palladium
    simulation acceleration and emulation products either on the
    customer internet site or remotely over a high-speed, secure
    network connection.

Third
    Party Programs and Initiatives

We recognize that certain of our customers may also use
    internally-developed design tools or design tools provided by
    other EDA companies, as well as IP available from multiple
    suppliers. We support the integration of third party design
    products through participation in the OpenAccess Initiative, the
    Connections

®

and OpenChoice IP programs. OpenAccess is a full-featured EDA
    database that supports access and manipulation of its internal
    EDA data via a fully documented and freely available programming
    interface. This provides an open application program interface
    through which applications developed by our customers, by their
    other EDA vendors, or by university research groups can all
    operate within a single database and with our products. We have
    licensed the OpenAccess database to the OpenAccess Coalition,
    which is operated by the Silicon Integration Initiative, or Si2,
    an organization of EDA, electronic system and semiconductor
    industry leaders focused on improving productivity and reducing
    cost in creating and producing integrated silicon systems.

The Connections Program provides member companies with access to
    our products to ensure that our products work well with third
    party tools. The OpenChoice IP program was instituted to enable
    interoperability and facilitate open collaboration with leading
    providers of library, processor, memory core and verification IP
    to build, validate and deliver accurate models optimized for
    Cadence design and verification solutions. The program aims to
    ensure IP quality and provide our customers with access to a
    broad IP portfolio that works with our products. A key component
    of the OpenChoice program is to assist and support library
    providers in the integration of our design and verification
    products and model formats into customer-owned tooling, or COT,
    library solutions.

In 2007, the Power Forward Initiative membership grew to 24
    electronics industry leaders who recognized the urgent need for
    an automated, power-aware design infrastructure to facilitate
    the production of ICs that consume significantly less power.
    This group participated in the refinement and standardization of
    the Common Power Format, or CPF. CPF is a specification language
    that holistically captures low-power design intent so that it
    can be communicated consistently throughout the IC design
    process. We have contributed the CPF specification to Si2, which
    manages the standardization, maintenance and distribution of CPF
    for the benefit of the electronics industry.

In addition, we work with vendors of Application-Specific
    Integrated Circuits, or ASICs, to ensure predictable and smooth
    handoff of design data from mutual customers to ASIC
    implementation. These programs foster relationships throughout
    the silicon design chain with leading IP partners, silicon
    manufacturers and library provider partners to support both ASIC
    and COT solutions for our customers. They are integral to
    providing complete design chain solutions to IC and electronic
    systems designers who depend on coordinated offerings from
    multiple suppliers.

Maintenance

We provide technical support to our customers to facilitate
    their use of our software and hardware products. A high level of
    customer service and support is critical to the adoption and
    successful use of our products. We have a global customer
    support organization and specialized field application
    engineering teams located in each of our operating regions to
    provide assistance to customers where and when they need it.

Standard maintenance support includes three major components:
    our
    Sourcelink

®

online support portal, which provides 24 hour access to
    real-time technical information on our products; contact center
    support (telephone, email and web access to our support
    engineers); and software updates (periodic updates with
    regression-tested critical fixes and updated functionality
    available via CDs or secure internet download).

Maintenance is offered to customers as an integral,
    non-cancelable component of our subscription license agreements,
    or as a separate agreement subject to annual renewal for our
    term and perpetual license customers.

Some of our customers have relocated, or expanded the presence
    of their design teams, away from their headquarters or
    historical locations to locations in emerging growth regions.
    Accordingly, to provide responsive and effective support for
    these customers, we expect to continue expanding the presence of
    our own support and application engineering teams in these
    emerging growth regions.



Maintenance revenue was $385.2 million, or 24% of our total
    revenue, in 2007, $366.3 million, or 25% of our total
    revenue, in 2006 and $351.5 million, or 26% of our total
    revenue, in 2005. We expect that maintenance revenue in 2008
    will be generated predominantly from backlog.

Services

We offer a number of fee-based services, including engineering
    and education services related to IC design and methodology.
    These services may be sold separately or sold and performed in
    conjunction with the sale, lease or license of our products.

Services revenue was $125.8 million, or 8% of our total
    revenue, in 2007, $134.9 million, or 9% of our total
    revenue, in 2006 and $126.2 million, or 9% of our total
    revenue, in 2005.

Engineering
    Services

We offer engineering services and reusable design technologies
    to aid customers with the design of complex ICs and the
    implementation of design capabilities. We focus our offerings
    primarily on SoC devices, including both ASICs and
    Application-Specific Standard Parts, and on analog and
    mixed-signal ICs. The customers for these services primarily
    consist of semiconductor and systems companies developing
    products for the communications, computing and consumer markets.
    We offer engineering capabilities to assist customers from
    product concept through volume manufacturing.

We also make our design IP portfolio available to customers as
    part of our technology and services solutions. These reusable
    design and methodology components enable us to more efficiently
    deliver our services, and allow our customers to reduce the
    design complexity and time to market for the development of
    complex SoCs.

In our design and methodology service practices, we leverage our
    cumulative experience and knowledge of design techniques and
    leading practices with many customers and different design
    environments to improve our own service teams’ and our
    customers’ productivity. We work with customers using
    outsourcing, consultative and collaborative models depending on
    their projects and needs. Our Virtual Computer-Aided Design, or
    VCAD, model enables our engineering teams at one or more of our
    locations to virtually work

“side-by-side”

with our customers’ teams located elsewhere during the
    course of their design and engineering projects through a secure
    private network infrastructure.

Through collaboration with our customers, we are able to design
    advanced ICs and gain direct and early visibility to industry
    design issues that may not be addressed adequately by
    today’s EDA technologies. This enables us to accelerate the
    development of new software technology and products to meet the
    market’s current and future design requirements.

Education
    Services

Our education services offerings include internet, classroom and
    custom courses, the content of which ranges from how to use the
    most recent features of our EDA products to instruction in the
    latest IC design techniques. The primary focus of education
    services is to accelerate our customers’ path to
    productivity in the use of Cadence products and increase
    awareness of the total solution required for engineering success.

Marketing
    and Sales

We generally use a direct sales force consisting of sales people
    and applications engineers to market our products and provide
    maintenance and services to existing and prospective customers.
    Applications engineers provide technical pre-sales and
    post-sales support for software products. Due to the complexity
    of many of our EDA products and the electronic design process in
    general, the sales cycle is generally long, requiring three to
    six months or more. During the sales cycle, our direct sales
    force generally provides technical presentations, product
    demonstrations and support for

on-site

customer evaluation of our software. We also use traditional
    marketing approaches to promote our products and services,
    including advertising, direct mail, telemarketing, trade shows,
    public relations and the internet. As EDA products mature and
    become widely understood by the marketplace, we selectively
    utilize value added resellers to broaden our reach and reduce
    cost of sales. All OrCAD and selected Incisive products are
    primarily marketed through these channels. With respect to
    international sales, we generally market and support our
    products and services through our subsidiaries.



Software
    Licensing Arrangements

We sell software using three license types: subscription, term
    and perpetual. Customers who prefer to license technology for a
    specified, limited period of time will choose either a
    subscription or term license, and customers who prefer to have
    the right to use the technology continuously without time
    restriction will choose a perpetual license. Customers who
    desire rights to remix in new technology during the life of the
    contract will select a subscription license, which allows them
    limited access to unspecified new technology on a

when-and-if-available

basis, as opposed to a term or perpetual license which does not
    include remix rights to new technology. Payment terms for
    subscription and term licenses generally provide for payments to
    be made in installments over the license period and payment
    terms for perpetual licenses generally are net 30 days.

Our revenue recognition depends on a number of contract-specific
    terms and conditions, including the license type, payment terms,
    creditworthiness of the customer and other factors as more fully
    described in this Annual Report under the heading “Critical
    Accounting Estimates” under Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations.” Revenue associated
    with subscription licenses is recognized over multiple periods
    during the license term, whereas product revenue associated with
    term and perpetual licenses is generally recognized upon the
    later of the effective date of the license or delivery of the
    product, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition
    have been met. The amount of product revenue recognized from
    backlog varies from quarter to quarter. For the past three years
    the amount of product revenue recognized from backlog generally
    has been approximately two-thirds of total product revenue.

Our revenue and results of operations may miss expectations due
    to a shortfall in product revenue generated from current
    transactions or variance in the actual mix of license types
    executed in any given period, and due to other contract-specific
    terms and conditions as discussed above. We are subject to
    greater credit risk on subscription and term licenses, as
    compared to perpetual licenses, due to the installment payment
    terms generally associated with those license types. Otherwise,
    the particular risks of one license type versus another type do
    not vary considerably.

From time to time we sell receivables generated by our licenses
    with installment payment terms to third party financing
    institutions on a non-recourse or limited-recourse basis.

For a further description of our license agreements, revenue
    recognition policies and results of operations, please refer to
    the discussion under the heading “Critical Accounting
    Estimates” under Item 7, “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.”

Research
    and Development

Our investment in research and development was
    $494.0 million in 2007, $460.1 million in 2006 and
    $390.7 million in 2005.

The primary areas of our research and development include SoC
    design, the design of silicon devices in the nanometer range,
    high-performance IC packaging, SiP and PCB design, system-level
    modeling and verification, high-performance logic verification
    technology and hardware/software co-verification. Because the
    electronics industry combines rapid innovation with rapidly
    increasing design and manufacturing complexity, we make
    significant investments in enhancing our current products, as
    well as creating new products and technologies and integrating
    those products and technologies together into segmented
    solutions.

Our future performance depends largely on our ability to
    maintain and enhance our current product development and
    commercialization, to develop, acquire or operate with new
    products from third parties, and to develop solutions that meet
    increasingly demanding productivity, quality, predictability and
    cost requirements. In addition to our product development team,
    which focuses on new and existing products, we maintain Cadence
    Laboratories, an advanced research group responsible for
    exploring new technologies, moving those technologies into
    product development and maintaining strong industry
    relationships.

Manufacturing
    and Distribution

Our software production consists of configuring the
    customer’s order, recording the product electronically or
    on CD-ROM, and producing unique access keys that allow customers
    to use licensed products. Software and documentation are
    primarily distributed to customers by secure electronic
    delivery. User manuals and other



documentation are generally available by secure electronic
    delivery or on CD-ROM, but are occasionally supplied in hard
    copy format.

Cadence performs final assembly and test of its hardware
    verification, acceleration and emulation products in
    San Jose, California. Subcontractors manufacture all major
    subassemblies, including all individual PCBs and custom ICs, and
    supply them for qualification and testing prior to their
    incorporation into the assembled product.

Proprietary
    Technology

Our success depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology.
    We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade
    secret laws, licenses and restrictive agreements to establish
    and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products.
    Many of our products include software or other intellectual
    property licensed from third parties. We may have to seek new
    licenses or renew existing licenses for this third party
    software and other intellectual property in the future. As part
    of performing design and methodology services for customers, our
    design and methodology services business uses certain software
    and other intellectual property licensed from third parties,
    including that of our competitors.

Competition

We compete in the EDA market for products and maintenance
    primarily with three companies: Synopsys, Inc., Mentor Graphics
    Corporation and Magma Design Automation, Inc. We also compete
    with numerous smaller EDA companies, with manufacturers of
    electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to
    develop their own EDA products, and with numerous electronics
    design and consulting companies. We generally compete on the
    basis of product quality, product features, level of integration
    or compatibility with other tools, price, payment terms and
    maintenance offerings.

Our maintenance business flows directly from our product
    business. The competitive issues associated with our maintenance
    business are substantially similar to those for our product
    business in that every maintenance contract is the direct result
    of a product contract, and once we have entered into a product
    contract, maintenance is generally purchased by the customer to
    ensure access to bug fixes and service releases, as and when
    they are made available, and other continued support.

Certain competitive factors in the design and methodology
    services business as described herein differ from those of the
    products and maintenance businesses. While we do compete with
    other EDA companies in the design and methodology services
    business, our principal competitors are independent design and
    methodology service businesses. These companies vary greatly in
    focus, geographic location, capability, cost structure and
    pricing. In addition, manufacturers of electronic devices may be
    reluctant to purchase services from independent vendors, such as
    Cadence, because they wish to promote their own internal design
    departments. We compete with these companies by focusing on the
    design of complex analog and digital ICs. It is our strategy to
    use design and methodology services as a differentiator to
    further promote our products and maintenance businesses.

Backlog

Our backlog on December 29, 2007 was approximately
    $2.0 billion, as compared to approximately
    $1.9 billion on December 30, 2006. Backlog consists of
    revenue to be recognized in future fiscal periods after
    December 29, 2007 from a variety of license types which
    generally include, but are not limited to:

•

Subscription licenses for software products;

•

Sale or lease of hardware;

•

Maintenance contracts on hardware and software products;

•

Orders for hardware and software products sold on perpetual and
    term licenses on which customers have delivery dates after
    December 29, 2007;

•

Licenses with payments that are outside our customary
    terms; and

•

The undelivered portion of design and methodology services
    contracts.

The substantial majority of our backlog is generated by our
    product and maintenance businesses because customer licenses
    generally include both product and maintenance components.
    Historically, we have not experienced significant cancellations
    of our contracts with customers. However, we occasionally
    reschedule the required completion dates of design and
    methodology services contracts which, at times, defers revenue
    recognition



under those contracts beyond the original expected completion
    date. Changes in customer license types or payment terms also
    can impact the timing of revenue recognition.

Revenue
    Seasonality

Historically, orders and revenue have been lowest in our first
    quarter and highest in our fourth quarter, with a material
    decline between the fourth quarter of one year and the first
    quarter of the next year. We expect the first quarter will
    remain our lowest quarter for orders and revenues.

International
    Operations

We have approximately 60 sales offices, design centers and
    research and development facilities located around the world. We
    consider customer sales and support requirements, the
    availability of a skilled workforce, and costs and efficiencies,
    among other relative benefits, when determining what operations
    to locate internationally. For additional information regarding
    our international operations, see the discussion under the
    heading “

The effect of foreign exchange rate
    fluctuations and other risks to our international operations may
    seriously harm our financial condition”

in
    Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Note 22 to our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Employees

As of December 29, 2007, we employed approximately 5,300
    individuals, with approximately 2,000 in sales, services,
    marketing, support and manufacturing activities, approximately
    2,600 in product research and development and approximately 700
    in management, administration and finance. None of our employees
    is represented by a labor union, and we have experienced no work
    stoppages. We believe that our employee relations are good.

Item 1A. Risk
    Factors

Our business faces many risks. Described below are what we
    believe to be the material risks that we face. If any of the
    events or circumstances described in the following risks
    actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of
    operations could suffer.

Risks
    Related to Our Business

We are
    subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated circuit and
    electronics systems industries, and any

downturn in these industries may reduce our
    revenue.

Purchases of our products and services are dependent upon the
    commencement of new design projects by IC manufacturers and
    electronics systems companies. The IC and electronics systems
    industries are cyclical and are characterized by constant and
    rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price
    erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and wide
    fluctuations in product supply and demand.

The IC and electronics systems industries have experienced
    significant downturns, often connected with, or in anticipation
    of, maturing product cycles of both these industries’ and
    their customers’ products and a decline in general economic
    conditions. These downturns have been characterized by
    diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high
    inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling
    prices. Any economic downturn in the industries we serve could
    harm our business, operating results or financial condition.

Our
    failure to respond quickly to technological developments could
    make our products uncompetitive and obsolete.

The industries in which we compete experience rapid technology
    developments, changes in industry standards, changes in customer
    requirements and frequent new product introductions and
    improvements. Currently, the industries we serve are
    experiencing several revolutionary trends:

•

Migration to nanometer design: the size of features such as
    wires, transistors and contacts on ICs continuously shrink due
    to the ongoing advances in semiconductor manufacturing
    processes. Process feature sizes refer to the width of the
    transistors and the width and spacing of interconnect on the IC.
    Feature size is normally identified by the transistor length,
    which is shrinking rapidly to 65 nanometers and smaller. This is
    commonly referred to in the semiconductor industry as the
    migration to nanometer design. It represents a major challenge
    for participants in the semiconductor industry, from IC design
    and



design automation to design of manufacturing equipment and the
    manufacturing process itself. Shrinkage of transistor length to
    such proportions is challenging the industry in the application
    of more complex physics and chemistry that is needed to realize
    advanced silicon devices. For EDA tools, models of each
    component’s electrical properties and behavior become more
    complex as do requisite analysis, design and verification
    capabilities. Novel design tools and methodologies must be
    invented quickly to remain competitive in the design of
    electronics in the smallest nanometer ranges.

•

The challenges of nanometer design are leading some customers to
    work with older, less risky manufacturing processes. This may
    reduce their need to upgrade their EDA products and design flows.

•

The ability to design

system-on-a-chip

devices, or SoCs, increases the complexity of managing a design
    that, at the lowest level, is represented by billions of shapes
    on the fabrication mask. In addition, SoCs typically incorporate
    microprocessors and digital signal processors that are
    programmed with software, requiring simultaneous design of the
    IC and the related software embedded on the IC.

•

With the availability of seemingly endless gate capacity, there
    is an increase in design reuse, or the combining of
    off-the-shelf design IP with custom logic to create ICs. The
    unavailability of high-quality design IP that can be reliably
    incorporated into a customer’s design with Cadence IC
    implementation products and services could reduce demand for our
    products and services.

•

Increased technological capability of the Field-Programmable
    Gate Array, which is a programmable logic chip, creates an
    alternative to IC implementation for some electronics companies.
    This could reduce demand for Cadence’s IC implementation
    products and services.

•

A growing number of low-cost design and methodology services
    businesses could reduce the need for some IC companies to invest
    in EDA products.

If we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these
    developments, we may lose our competitive position, and our
    products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete.
    To compete successfully, we must develop or acquire new products
    and improve our existing products and processes on a schedule
    that keeps pace with technological developments and the
    requirements for products addressing a broad spectrum of
    designers and designer expertise in our industries. We must also
    be able to support a range of changing computer software,
    hardware platforms and customer preferences. We cannot guarantee
    that we will be successful in this effort.

We
    have experienced varied operating results, and our operating
    results for any particular fiscal period are affected by the
    timing of significant orders for our software products,
    fluctuations in customer preferences for license types and the
    timing of revenue recognition under those license
    types.

We have experienced, and may continue to experience, varied
    operating results. In particular, we have experienced net losses
    for some past periods and we may experience net losses in future
    periods. Various factors affect our operating results and some
    of them are not within our control. Our operating results for
    any period are affected by the timing of significant orders for
    our software products because a significant number of licenses
    for our software products are in excess of $5.0 million.

Our operating results are also affected by the mix of license
    types executed in any given period. We license software using
    three different license types: subscription, term and perpetual.
    Product revenue associated with term and perpetual licenses is
    generally recognized at the beginning of the license period,
    whereas product revenue associated with subscription licenses is
    recognized over multiple periods during the term of the license.
    Revenue may also be deferred under term and perpetual licenses
    until payments become due and payable from customers with
    nonlinear payment terms or as cash is collected from customers
    with lower credit ratings. In addition, revenue is impacted by
    the timing of license renewals, the extent to which contracts
    contain flexible payment terms, changes in existing contractual
    arrangements with customers and the mix of license types (i.e.,
    perpetual, term or subscription) for existing customers, which
    changes could have the effect of accelerating or delaying the
    recognition of revenue from the timing of recognition under the
    original contract.

We plan operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted
    revenue levels. These expenses and the impact of long-term
    commitments are relatively fixed in the short term. A shortfall
    in revenue could lead to operating results below expectations
    because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed
    expenses in response to these short-term business changes.

The majority of our contracts are executed in the final two
    weeks of a fiscal quarter. This makes it difficult to determine
    with accuracy how much business will be executed in each fiscal
    quarter. Due to the volume or



complexity of transactions that we review at the very end of the
    quarter, or due to operational matters regarding particular
    agreements, we may not finish processing or ship products under
    some contracts that have been signed during that fiscal quarter,
    which means that the associated revenue cannot be recognized in
    that particular period.

You should not view our historical results of operations as
    reliable indicators of our future performance. If revenue,
    operating results or our business outlook for future periods
    fall short of the levels expected by public market analysts or
    investors, the trading price of our common stock could decline.

Our
    future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed customer
    base continuing to license or buy additional products,
    renew maintenance agreements and purchase additional
    services.

Our installed customer base has traditionally generated
    additional new license, service and maintenance revenues. In
    future periods, customers may not necessarily license or buy
    additional products or contract for additional services or
    maintenance. Maintenance is generally renewable annually at a
    customer’s option, and there are no mandatory payment
    obligations or obligations to license additional software. If
    our customers decide not to renew their maintenance agreements
    or license additional products or contract for additional
    services, or if they reduce the scope of the maintenance
    agreements, our revenue could decrease, which could have an
    adverse effect on our results of operations.

We may
    not receive significant revenue from our current research and
    development efforts for several years, if at
    all.

Internally developing software products, integrating acquired
    software products and integrating intellectual property into
    existing platforms is expensive, and these investments often
    require a long time to generate returns. Our strategy involves
    significant investments in software research and development and
    related product opportunities. We believe that we must continue
    to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research
    and development efforts to maintain our competitive position.
    However, we cannot predict that we will receive significant, if
    any, revenue from these investments.

Our
    failure to attract, train, motivate and retain key employees may
    make us less competitive in our industries and therefore
    harm our results of operations.

Our business depends on the efforts and abilities of our
    employees. The high cost of training new employees, not fully
    utilizing these employees, or losing trained employees to
    competing employers could reduce our gross margins and harm our
    business or operating results. Competition for highly skilled
    employees can be intense, particularly in geographic areas
    recognized as high technology centers such as the Silicon Valley
    area, where our principal offices are located, and the other
    locations where we maintain facilities. To attract, retain and
    motivate individuals with the requisite expertise, we may be
    required to grant large numbers of stock options or other
    stock-based incentive awards, which may be dilutive to existing
    stockholders and increase compensation expense. We may also be
    required to pay key employees significant base salaries and cash
    bonuses, which could harm our operating results.

In addition, the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules require stockholder
    approval for new equity compensation plans and significant
    amendments to existing plans, including increases in shares
    available for issuance under such plans, and prohibit NASDAQ
    member organizations from giving a proxy to vote on equity
    compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has
    given voting instructions. These regulations could make it more
    difficult for us to grant equity compensation to employees in
    the future. To the extent that these regulations make it more
    difficult or expensive to grant equity compensation to
    employees, we may incur increased compensation costs or find it
    difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, which could
    materially and adversely affect our business.

We
    have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and
    businesses and may not realize the expected benefits of
    these acquisitions.

We have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and
    businesses in the future. While we expect to carefully analyze
    each potential acquisition before committing to the transaction,
    we may not be able to integrate and manage acquired products and
    businesses effectively. In addition, acquisitions involve a
    number of risks. If any



of the following events occurs after we acquire another
    business, it could seriously harm our business, operating
    results or financial condition:

•

Difficulties in combining previously separate businesses into a
    single unit;

•

The substantial diversion of management’s attention from
    day-to-day business when evaluating and negotiating these
    transactions and integrating an acquired business;

•

The discovery, after completion of the acquisition, of
    liabilities assumed from the acquired business or of assets
    acquired for which we cannot realize the anticipated value;

•

The failure to realize anticipated benefits such as cost savings
    and revenue enhancements;

•

The failure to retain key employees of the acquired business;

•

Difficulties related to integrating the products of an acquired
    business in, for example, distribution, engineering and customer
    support areas;

•

Unanticipated costs;

•

Customer dissatisfaction with existing license agreements with
    Cadence which may dissuade them from licensing or buying
    products acquired by Cadence after the effective date of the
    license; and

•

The failure to understand and compete effectively in markets in
    which we have limited experience.

In a number of our previously completed acquisitions, we have
    agreed to make future payments, either in the form of employee
    bonuses or contingent purchase price payments, or earnouts,
    based on the performance of the acquired businesses or the
    employees who joined us with the acquired businesses. The
    performance goals pursuant to which these future payments may be
    made generally relate to achievement by the acquired business or
    the employees who joined us with the acquired business of
    certain specified bookings, revenue, product proliferation,
    product development or employee retention goals during a
    specified period following completion of the applicable
    acquisition. Future acquisitions may involve issuances of stock
    as full or partial payment of the purchase price for the
    acquired business, grants of incentive stock or options to
    employees of the acquired businesses (which may be dilutive to
    existing stockholders), expenditure of substantial cash
    resources or the incurrence of material amounts of debt.

The specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of
    employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments vary with
    each acquisition. In connection with our acquisitions completed
    prior to December 29, 2007, we may be obligated to pay up
    to an aggregate of $45.0 million in cash during the next
    53 months if certain performance goals related to one or
    more of the criteria mentioned above are achieved in full.

The
    competition in our industries is substantial and we may not be
    able to continue to successfully compete in our
    industries.

The EDA market and the commercial electronics design and
    methodology services industries are highly competitive. If we
    fail to compete successfully in these industries, it could
    seriously harm our business, operating results or financial
    condition. To compete in these industries, we must identify and
    develop or acquire innovative and cost-competitive EDA products,
    integrate them into platforms and market them in a timely
    manner. We must also gain industry acceptance for our design and
    methodology services and offer better strategic concepts,
    technical solutions, prices and response time, or a combination
    of these factors, than those of other design companies and the
    internal design departments of electronics manufacturers. We
    cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully
    in these industries. Factors that could affect our ability to
    succeed include:

•

The development by others of competitive EDA products or
    platforms and design and methodology services, which could
    result in a shift of customer preferences away from our products
    and services and significantly decrease revenue;

•

Decisions by electronics manufacturers to perform design and
    methodology services internally, rather than purchase these
    services from outside vendors due to budget constraints or
    excess engineering capacity;

•

The challenges of developing (or acquiring externally-developed)
    technology solutions that are adequate and competitive in
    meeting the requirements of next-generation design challenges;

•

The significant number of current and potential competitors in
    the EDA industry and the low cost of entry;

•

Intense competition to attract acquisition targets, which may
    make it more difficult for us to acquire companies or
    technologies at an acceptable price or at all; and



•

The combination of or collaboration among many EDA companies to
    deliver more comprehensive offerings than they could
    individually.

We compete in the EDA products market with Synopsys, Inc.,
    Mentor Graphics Corporation and Magma Design Automation, Inc. We
    also compete with numerous smaller EDA companies, with
    manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed or have
    the capability to develop their own EDA products, and with
    numerous electronics design and consulting companies.
    Manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant to purchase
    design and methodology services from independent vendors such as
    us because they wish to promote their own internal design
    departments.

We may
    need to change our pricing models to compete
    successfully.

The highly competitive markets in which we compete can put
    pressure on us to reduce the prices of our products. If our
    competitors offer deep discounts on certain products in an
    effort to recapture or gain market segment share or to sell
    other software or hardware products, we may then need to lower
    our prices or offer other favorable terms to compete
    successfully. Any such changes would be likely to reduce our
    profit margins and could adversely affect our operating results.
    Any substantial changes to our prices and pricing policies could
    cause sales and software license revenues to decline or be
    delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust
    to the new pricing policies. Some of our competitors may bundle
    products for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing
    strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product
    implementations. These practices could, over time, significantly
    constrain the prices that we can charge for our products. If we
    cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in
    the number of sales or with lower spending, then the reduced
    license revenues resulting from lower prices could have an
    adverse effect on our results of operations.

We
    rely on our proprietary technology as well as software and other
    intellectual property rights licensed to us by third
    parties, and we cannot assure you that the precautions taken to
    protect our rights will be adequate or that we will
    continue to be able to adequately secure such intellectual
    property rights from third parties.

Our success depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology.
    We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade
    secret laws, licenses and restrictive agreements to establish
    and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products.
    Despite precautions we may take to protect our intellectual
    property, third parties have tried in the past, and may try in
    the future, to challenge, invalidate or circumvent these
    safeguards. The rights granted under our patents or attendant to
    our other intellectual property may not provide us with any
    competitive advantages and there is no guarantee that patents
    will be issued on any of our pending applications and future
    patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology.
    Furthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our
    proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as
    applicable law protects these rights in the United States. Many
    of our products include software or other intellectual property
    licensed from third parties. We may have to seek new or renew
    existing licenses for such software and other intellectual
    property in the future. Our design and methodology services
    business holds licenses to certain software and other
    intellectual property owned by third parties, including that of
    our competitors. Our failure to obtain, for our use, software or
    other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual
    property rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in
    litigation over these licenses or rights, could seriously harm
    our business, operating results or financial condition.

We
    could lose key technology or suffer serious harm to our business
    because of the infringement of our intellectual property
    rights by third parties or because of our infringement of the
    intellectual property rights of third
    parties.

There are numerous patents in the EDA industry and new patents
    are being issued at a rapid rate. It is not always practicable
    to determine in advance whether a product or any of its
    components infringes the patent rights of others. As a result,
    from time to time, we may be compelled to respond to or
    prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect
    our rights or defend a customer’s rights.

Intellectual property infringement claims, regardless of merit,
    could consume valuable management time, result in costly
    litigation, or cause product shipment delays, all of which could
    seriously harm our business, operating results or financial
    condition. In settling these claims, we may be required to enter
    into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties
    claiming infringement. These royalty or licensing agreements, if



available, may not have terms favorable to us. Being compelled
    to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could
    seriously harm our business, operating results or financial
    condition. Any potential intellectual property litigation could
    compel us to do one or more of the following:

•

Pay damages (including the potential for treble damages),
    license fees or royalties (including royalties for past periods)
    to the party claiming infringement;

•

Stop licensing products or providing services that use the
    challenged intellectual property;

•

Obtain a license from the owner of the infringed intellectual
    property to sell or use the relevant technology, which license
    may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all; or

•

Redesign the challenged technology, which could be
    time-consuming and costly, or not be accomplished.

If we were compelled to take any of these actions, our business
    or results of operations may suffer.

If our
    security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains
    access to customer data, our information systems may be
    perceived as being unsecure and customers may curtail or stop
    their use of our products and services.

Our products and services involve the storage and transmission
    of customers’ proprietary information, and breaches of our
    security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of
    this information, litigation and potential liability. Because
    techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage
    information systems change frequently and generally are not
    recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to
    anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive
    measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security
    occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our
    security measures could be harmed and we could lose existing
    customers and our ability to obtain new customers.

We may
    not be able to effectively implement our restructuring
    activities, and our restructuring activities may not result
    in the expected benefits, which would negatively impact our
    future results of operations.

The EDA market and the commercial electronics design and
    methodology services industries are highly competitive and
    change quickly. We have responded to increased competition and
    changes in the industries in which we compete, in part, by
    restructuring our operations and at times reducing the size of
    our workforce. Despite our restructuring efforts in prior years,
    we may not achieve all of the operating expense reductions and
    improvements in operating margins and cash flows anticipated
    from those restructuring activities in the periods contemplated.
    Our inability to realize these benefits may result in an
    inefficient business structure that could negatively impact our
    results of operations.

We have reduced the workforce in certain revenue-generating
    portions of our business. These reductions in staffing levels
    could require us to forego certain future opportunities due to
    resource limitations, which could negatively affect our
    long-term revenues. We may need to implement further
    restructuring activities or reductions in our workforce based on
    changes in the markets and industries in which we compete or
    that any future restructuring efforts will be successful.

The
    long sales cycle of our products and services makes the timing
    of our revenue difficult to predict and may cause our
    operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly.

Generally, we have a long sales cycle that can extend up to six
    months or longer. The length of the sales cycle may cause our
    revenue or operating results to vary from quarter to quarter.
    The complexity and expense associated with our business
    generally require a lengthy customer education, evaluation and
    approval process. Consequently, we may incur substantial
    expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to
    develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements
    or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities.

In addition, sales of our products and services may be delayed
    if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because
    of:

•

The timing of customers’ competitive evaluation
    processes; or

•

Customers’ budgetary constraints and budget cycles.



Long sales cycles for acceleration and emulation hardware
    products subject us to a number of significant risks over which
    we have limited control, including insufficient, excess or
    obsolete inventory, variations in inventory valuation and
    fluctuations in quarterly operating results.

The majority of our contracts are executed in the final two
    weeks of a fiscal quarter. This makes it difficult to determine
    with accuracy how much business will be executed in each fiscal
    quarter. Also, because of the timing of large orders and our
    customers’ buying patterns, we may not learn of bookings
    shortfalls, revenue shortfalls, earnings shortfalls or other
    failures to meet market expectations until late in a fiscal
    quarter. These factors may cause our operating results to
    fluctuate unexpectedly, which can cause significant fluctuations
    in the trading price of our common stock.

We may
    not be able to sell certain installment contracts to generate
    cash, which may impact our operating cash flows for any
    particular fiscal period.

We sell certain installment contracts to certain financing
    institutions on a non-recourse or limited-recourse basis to
    generate cash. Our ability to complete these sales of
    installment contracts is affected by a number of factors,
    including the:

•

Economic conditions in the securities markets;

•

Credit policies of the financing institutions; and

•

Credit quality of customers whose installment contracts are
    expected to be sold.

If we are unable to sell certain installment contracts, our
    operating cash flows would be adversely affected. There can be
    no assurance that funding will be available to us or, if
    available, that it will be on terms acceptable to us. If sources
    of funding are not available to us on a regular basis for any
    reason, including the occurrence of events of default,
    deterioration in credit quality in the underlying pool of
    receivables or otherwise, it would have a material adverse
    effect on our operating cash flows.

The
    effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other risks to
    our international operations may seriously harm our
    financial condition.

We have significant operations outside the United States. Our
    revenue from international operations as a percentage of total
    revenue was approximately 54% in 2007, 48% in 2006 and 54% in
    2005. We expect that revenue from our international operations
    will continue to account for a significant portion of our total
    revenue. We also transact business in various foreign
    currencies. Recent economic and political uncertainty and the
    volatility of foreign currencies in certain regions, most
    notably the Japanese yen, European Union euro, British pound and
    Indian rupee have had, and may in the future have, a harmful
    effect on our revenue or operating results.

Fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the United States
    dollar and the currencies of other countries in which we conduct
    business could seriously harm our business, operating results or
    financial condition. For example, when a foreign currency
    declines in value relative to the United States dollar, it takes
    more of the foreign currency to purchase the same amount of
    United States dollars than before the change. If we price our
    products and services in the foreign currency, we receive fewer
    United States dollars than we did before the change. If we price
    our products and services in United States dollars, the decrease
    in value of the local currency results in an increase in the
    price for our products and services compared to those products
    of our competitors that are priced in local currency. This could
    result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where
    business is transacted in the local currency. On the other hand,
    when a foreign currency increases in value relative to the
    United States dollar, it takes more United States dollars to
    purchase the same amount of the foreign currency. As we use the
    foreign currency to pay for payroll costs and other operating
    expenses in our international operations, this results in an
    increase in operating expenses.

Exposure to foreign currency transaction risk can arise when
    transactions are conducted in a currency different from the
    functional currency of one of our subsidiaries. A
    subsidiary’s functional currency is generally the currency
    in which it primarily conducts its operations, including product
    pricing, expenses and borrowings. Although we attempt to reduce
    the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, significant
    exchange rate movements may hurt our results of operations as
    expressed in United States dollars.

Our international operations may also be subject to other risks,
    including:

•

The adoption or expansion of government trade restrictions;

•

Limitations on repatriation of earnings;



•

Limitations on the conversion of foreign currencies;

•

Reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some
    countries;

•

Recessions in foreign economies;

•

Longer collection periods for receivables and greater difficulty
    in collecting accounts receivable;

•

Difficulties in managing foreign operations;

•

Political and economic instability;

•

Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;

•

Tariffs and other trade barriers; and

•

United States and other governments’ licensing requirements
    for exports, which may lengthen the sales cycle or restrict or
    prohibit the sale or licensing of certain products.

We have offices throughout the world, including key research and
    development facilities outside of the United States. Our
    operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations
    throughout the world. Activities that interfere with our
    international connectivity, such as computer hacking or the
    introduction of a virus into our computer systems, could
    significantly interfere with our business operations.

Our
    operating results could be adversely affected as a result of
    changes in our effective tax rates.

Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by
    the following:

•

Earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we are
    taxed at lower rates as compared to the United States federal
    and state statutory tax rates;

•

An increase in expenses not deductible for tax purposes,
    including certain stock-based compensation, write-offs of
    acquired in-process technology and impairment of goodwill;

•

Changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets;

•

Changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws;

•

Changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information that
    results in a recognition, derecognition, or change in
    measurement of a tax position taken in a prior period;

•

Increases to interest expenses classified in the financial
    statements as income taxes;

•

New accounting standards or interpretations of such standards;

•

A change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign
    earnings outside the United States; or

•

Results of tax examinations by the Internal Revenue Service, or
    IRS, and state and foreign tax authorities.

Any significant change in our future effective tax rates could
    adversely impact our results of operations for future periods.

We
    have received examination reports from the Internal Revenue
    Service proposing deficiencies in certain of our tax
    returns, and the outcome of current and future tax examinations
    may have a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations and cash flows.

The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine our income
    tax returns. In July 2006, the IRS completed its field
    examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years
    2000 through 2002 and issued an RAR in which the IRS proposed to
    assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period of
    approximately $324.0 million. In November 2006, the IRS
    revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year
    period to be approximately $318.0 million. The IRS is
    contesting our qualification for deferred recognition of certain
    proceeds received from restitution and settlement in connection
    with litigation during the period. The proposed tax deficiency
    for this item is approximately $152.0 million. The
    remaining proposed tax deficiency of approximately
    $166.0 million is primarily related to proposed adjustments
    to our transfer pricing arrangements that we had with foreign
    subsidiaries and to our deductions for foreign trade income. The
    IRS may make similar claims against our transfer pricing
    arrangements and deductions for foreign trade income in future
    examinations. We have filed a timely protest with the IRS and
    will seek resolution of the issues through the Appeals Office of
    the IRS, or the Appeals Office.

We believe that the proposed IRS adjustments are inconsistent
    with applicable tax laws and we are vigorously challenging these
    proposed adjustments. The RAR is not a final Statutory Notice of
    Deficiency but the IRS imposes interest on the proposed
    deficiencies until the matters are resolved. Interest is
    compounded daily at rates published



by the IRS, which rates are adjusted quarterly and have been
    between 4% and 10% since 2001. The IRS is currently examining
    our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2003 through
    2005.

We adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards
    Board, or FASB, Interpretation, or FIN, No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – An
    Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109,” on
    December 31, 2006, which was the first day of our 2007
    fiscal year. FIN No. 48 prescribes a new recognition
    threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
    recognition and measurement of an income tax position taken or
    expected to be taken in a tax return. Under
    FIN No. 48, only income tax positions that meet the
    “more likely than not” recognition threshold may be
    recognized in the financial statements. An income tax position
    that meets the “more likely than not” recognition
    threshold shall initially and subsequently be measured as the
    largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of
    being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority
    that has full knowledge of all relevant information.

Significant judgment is required in applying the principles of
    FIN No. 48 and Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standard, or SFAS, No. 109. The calculation of our
    provision for income taxes involves dealing with uncertainties
    in the application of complex tax laws and regulations. In
    determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, we
    regularly assess the potential settlement outcomes resulting
    from income tax examinations. However, the final outcome of tax
    examinations, including the total amount payable or the timing
    of any such payments upon resolution of these issues, cannot be
    estimated with certainty. In addition, we cannot be certain that
    such amount will not be materially different than that which is
    reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals.
    Should the IRS or other tax authorities assess additional taxes
    as a result of a current or a future examination, we may be
    required to record charges to operations in future periods that
    could have a material impact on the results of operations,
    financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or
    periods.

Forecasting
    our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject
    to uncertainty, and material differences between forecasted
    and actual tax rates could have a material impact on our results
    of operations.

Forecasts of our income tax position and resultant effective tax
    rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income
    tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of
    profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax
    jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates, as well as
    benefits from available deferred tax assets, the impact of
    various accounting rules and changes to these rules and results
    of tax audits. To forecast our global tax rate, pre-tax profits
    and losses by jurisdiction are estimated and tax expense by
    jurisdiction is calculated. If the mix of profits and losses,
    our ability to use tax credits, or effective tax rates by
    jurisdiction is different than those estimates, our actual tax
    rate could be materially different than forecasted, which could
    have a material impact on our results of operations.

Failure
    to obtain export licenses could harm our business by rendering
    us unable to ship products and transfer our technology
    outside of the United States.

We must comply with regulations of the United States and of
    certain other countries in shipping our software products and
    transferring our technology outside the United States and to
    foreign nationals. Although we have not had any significant
    difficulty complying with such regulations so far, any
    significant future difficulty in complying could harm our
    business, operating results or financial condition.

Errors
    or defects in our products and services could expose us to
    liability and harm our reputation.

Our customers use our products and services in designing and
    developing products that involve a high degree of technological
    complexity, each of which has its own specifications. Because of
    the complexity of the systems and products with which we work,
    some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only
    when put to full use in the marketplace. As a result, our
    customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in
    our software or the systems we design, or the products or
    systems incorporating our design and intellectual property may
    not operate as expected. Errors or defects could result in:

•

Loss of customers;

•

Loss of market segment share;

•

Failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance;

•

Diversion of development resources to resolve the problem;



•

Loss of or delay in revenue;

•

Increased service costs; and

•

Liability for damages.

If we
    become subject to unfair hiring claims, we could be prevented
    from hiring needed employees, incur liability for damages and
    incur substantial costs in defending ourselves.

Companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with
    competitors frequently claim that these competitors have engaged
    in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these
    persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets.
    These claims could prevent us from hiring employees or cause us
    to incur liability for damages. We could also incur substantial
    costs in defending ourselves or our employees against these
    claims, regardless of their merits. Defending ourselves from
    these claims could also divert the attention of our management
    away from our operations.

Our
    business is subject to the risk of earthquakes.

Our corporate headquarters, including certain of our research
    and development operations and certain of our distribution
    facilities, is located in the Silicon Valley area of Northern
    California, which is a region known to experience seismic
    activity. If significant seismic activity were to occur, our
    operations may be interrupted, which would adversely impact our
    business and results of operations.

We
    maintain research and development and other facilities in parts
    of the world that are not as politically stable as the United
    States, and as a result we may face a higher risk of business
    interruption from acts of war or terrorism than businesses
    located only or primarily in the United States.

We maintain international research and development and other
    facilities, some of which are in parts of the world that are not
    as politically stable as the United States. Consequently, we may
    face a greater risk of business interruption as a result of
    terrorist acts or military conflicts than businesses located
    domestically. Furthermore, this potential harm is exacerbated
    given that damage to or disruptions at our international
    research and development facilities could have an adverse effect
    on our ability to develop new or improve existing products as
    compared to other businesses which may only have sales offices
    or other less critical operations abroad. We are not insured for
    losses or interruptions caused by acts of war or terrorism.

Risks
    Related to Our Securities and Indebtedness

Our
    debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect
    our business, operating results or financial condition, and
    could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such
    indebtedness.

We have a substantial level of debt. As of December 29,
    2007, we had $730.4 million of outstanding indebtedness as
    follows:

•

$250.0 million related to our 1.375% Convertible
    Senior Notes Due 2011, or the 2011 Notes;

•

$250.0 million related to our 1.500% Convertible
    Senior Notes Due 2013, or the 2013 Notes and, together with the
    2011 Notes, the Convertible Senior Notes; and

•

$230.4 million related to our Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior
    Convertible Notes Due 2023, or the 2023 Notes.

The level of our indebtedness, among other things, could:

•

Make it difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations on
    our debt as described below;

•

Make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our
    business;

•

Reduce funds available for use in our operations;

•

Make it difficult for us to incur additional debt or obtain any
    necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital
    expenditures, debt service, acquisitions or general corporate
    purposes;

•

Limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in
    our business;

•

Make us more vulnerable in the event of an increase in interest
    rates if we must incur new debt to satisfy our obligations under
    the Convertible Senior Notes or the 2023 Notes; or

•

Place us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to less
    leveraged competitors and competitors that have greater access
    to capital resources.



If we experience a decline in revenue due to any of the factors
    described in this section entitled “Risk Factors,” or
    otherwise, we could have difficulty paying amounts due on our
    indebtedness. In the case of the 2023 Notes, although they
    mature in 2023, the holders of the 2023 Notes may require us to
    repurchase for cash all or any portion of the 2023 Notes on
    August 15, 2008 for 100.25% of the principal amount,
    August 15, 2013 for 100.00% of the principal amount and
    August 15, 2018 for 100.00% of the principal amount. As a
    result, although the 2023 Notes mature in 2023, the holders may
    require us to repurchase the 2023 Notes at an additional premium
    in 2008, which makes it probable that we will be required to
    repurchase the 2023 Notes in 2008 if they have not first been
    repurchased by us or are not otherwise converted.

If we are prohibited from paying our outstanding indebtedness,
    we could try to obtain the consent of the lenders under those
    arrangements to make such payment, or we could attempt to
    refinance the borrowings that contain the restrictions. If we do
    not obtain the necessary consents or refinance the borrowings,
    we may be unable to satisfy our outstanding indebtedness. Any
    such failure would constitute an event of default under our
    indebtedness, which could, in turn, constitute a default under
    the terms of any other indebtedness then outstanding.

If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise
    obtain funds necessary to make required payments, or if we fail
    to comply with the various requirements of our indebtedness, we
    would be in default, which would permit the holders of our
    indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness and
    could cause defaults under our other indebtedness as well. Any
    default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, operating results and financial
    condition. In addition, a material default on our indebtedness
    could suspend our eligibility to register securities using
    certain registration statement forms under SEC guidelines that
    permit incorporation by reference of substantial information
    regarding us, which could potentially hinder our ability to
    raise capital through the issuance of our securities and will
    increase the costs of such registration to us.

In August 2007, the FASB issued Proposed FASB Staff Position, or
    FSP, APB14-a, “Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments
    That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial
    Cash Settlement),” which, if issued in its present form,
    would require us to recognize additional non-cash interest
    expense related to our Convertible Senior Notes in our
    Consolidated Income Statements. If adopted in its present form,
    FSP APB

14-a

will have an adverse effect on our operating results and
    financial condition, particularly with respect to interest
    expense ratios commonly referred to by lenders, and could
    potentially hinder our ability to raise capital through the
    issuance of debt or equity securities.

Conversion
    of the 2023 Notes or the Convertible Senior Notes will dilute
    the ownership interests of existing stockholders.

The terms of the 2023 Notes and the Convertible Senior Notes
    permit the holders to convert the 2023 Notes and the Convertible
    Senior Notes into shares of our common stock. The 2023 Notes are
    convertible into our common stock initially at a conversion
    price of $15.65 per share, which would result in an aggregate of
    approximately 14.7 million shares of our common stock being
    issued upon conversion, subject to adjustment upon the
    occurrence of specified events. The terms of the Convertible
    Senior Notes stipulate a net share settlement, which upon
    conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes requires us to pay
    the principal amount in cash and the conversion premium, if any,
    in shares of our common stock based on a daily settlement
    amount, calculated on a proportionate basis for each day of the
    relevant 20

trading-day

observation period. The initial conversion rate for the
    Convertible Senior Notes is 47.2813 shares of our common
    stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes,
    equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $21.15 per
    share of our common stock. The conversion price is subject to
    adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued
    interest, except in limited circumstances. The conversion of
    some or all of the 2023 Notes or the Convertible Senior Notes
    will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders.
    Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon
    conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of
    our common stock.

Prior to conversion of the 2023 Notes, if the trading price of
    our common stock exceeds $22.69 per share over specified
    periods, basic net income per share will be diluted. We may
    redeem for cash all or any part of the 2023 Notes on or after
    August 15, 2008 for 100.00% of the principal amount. The
    holders of the 2023 Notes may require us to repurchase for cash
    all or any portion of their 2023 Notes on August 15, 2008
    for 100.25% of the principal amount, on August 15, 2013 for
    100.00% of the principal amount, or on August 15, 2018 for
    100.00% of the principal amount, by providing to the paying
    agent a written repurchase notice. The repurchase notice must be
    delivered during the period commencing 30 business days prior to
    the relevant repurchase date and ending on the



close of business on the business day prior to the relevant
    repurchase date. We may redeem for cash all or any part of the
    2023 Notes on or after August 15, 2008 for 100.00% of the
    principal amount, except for those 2023 Notes that holders have
    required us to repurchase on August 15, 2008 or on other
    repurchase dates, as described above.

Each $1,000 of principal of the 2023 Notes is initially
    convertible into 63.879 shares of our common stock, subject
    to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders
    of the 2023 Notes may convert their 2023 Notes prior to maturity
    only if:

•

The price of our common stock reaches $22.69 during certain
    periods of time specified in the 2023 Notes;

•

Specified corporate transactions occur;

•

The 2023 Notes have been called for redemption; or

•

The trading price of the 2023 Notes falls below a certain
    threshold.

As a result, although the 2023 Notes mature in 2023, the holders
    may require us to repurchase their notes at an additional
    premium in 2008, which makes it probable that we will be
    required to repurchase the 2023 Notes in 2008 if they have not
    first been repurchased by us or are not otherwise converted. As
    of December 29, 2007, none of the conditions allowing
    holders of the 2023 Notes to convert had been met.

Each $1,000 of principal of the Convertible Senior Notes is
    initially convertible into 47.2813 shares of our common
    stock, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified
    events. Holders of the Convertible Senior Notes may convert
    their notes at their option on any day prior to the close of
    business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding
    December 15, 2011 in the case of the 2011 Notes and
    December 15, 2013 in the case of the 2013 Notes, in each
    case only if:

•

The price of our common stock reaches $27.50 during certain
    periods of time specified in the Convertible Senior Notes;

•

Specified corporate transactions occur; or

•

The trading price of the Convertible Senior Notes falls below a
    certain threshold.

On and after November 2, 2011, in the case of the 2011
    Notes, and November 1, 2013, in the case of 2013 Notes,
    until the close of business on the scheduled trading day
    immediately preceding the maturity date of such Convertible
    Senior Notes, holders may convert their Convertible Senior Notes
    at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. As of
    December 29, 2007, none of the conditions allowing holders
    of the Convertible Senior Notes to convert had been met.

Although the conversion price of the 2023 Notes is currently
    $15.65 per share, the hedge and warrant transactions that we
    entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2023 Notes
    effectively increased the conversion price of the 2023 Notes
    until various dates in 2008 to approximately $23.08 per share,
    which would result in an aggregate issuance upon conversion
    prior to August 15, 2008 of approximately 10.2 million
    shares of our common stock. We entered into hedge and warrant
    transactions to reduce the potential dilution from the
    conversion of the 2023 Notes. However, we cannot guarantee that
    such hedge and warrant instruments will fully mitigate the
    dilution. In addition, the existence of the 2023 Notes may
    encourage short selling by market participants because the
    conversion of the 2023 Notes could depress the price of our
    common stock.

Although the conversion price of the Convertible Senior Notes is
    currently $21.15 per share, we entered into hedge and separate
    warrant transactions to reduce the potential dilution from the
    conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes. However, we cannot
    guarantee that such hedges and warrant instruments will fully
    mitigate the dilution. In addition, the existence of the
    Convertible Senior Notes may encourage short selling by market
    participants because the conversion of the Convertible Senior
    Notes could depress the price of our common stock.

At the
    option of the 2023 Noteholders and the Convertible Senior
    Noteholders under certain circumstances, we may be required to
    repurchase the 2023 Notes and the Convertible Senior Notes, as
    the case may be, in cash or shares of our common
    stock.

Under the terms of the 2023 Notes and the Convertible Senior
    Notes, we may be required to repurchase the 2023 Notes and the
    Convertible Senior Notes following a “fundamental
    change” in our corporate ownership or structure, such as a
    change of control in which substantially all of the
    consideration does not consist of publicly traded securities,
    prior to maturity of the 2023 Notes and the Convertible Senior
    Notes, as the case may be.



Following a fundamental change, in certain circumstances, we may
    choose to pay the repurchase price of the 2023 Notes in cash,
    shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares
    of our common stock. If we choose to pay all or any part of the
    repurchase price of the 2023 Notes in shares of our common
    stock, this would result in dilution to the holders of our
    common stock. The repurchase price for the Convertible Senior
    Notes in the event of a fundamental change must be paid solely
    in cash. These repayment obligations may have the effect of
    discouraging, delaying or preventing a takeover of our company
    that may otherwise be beneficial to investors.

Hedge
    and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the
    issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes and the 2023 Notes may
    affect the value of our common stock.

We entered into hedge transactions with various financial
    institutions, at the time of issuance of the Convertible Senior
    Notes and the 2023 Notes, with the objective of reducing the
    potential dilutive effect of issuing our common stock upon
    conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes and the 2023 Notes.
    We also entered into separate warrant transactions with the same
    financial institutions. In connection with our hedge and warrant
    transactions, these financial institutions purchased our common
    stock in secondary market transactions and entered into various
    over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our
    common stock. These entities or their affiliates are likely to
    modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to
    conversion or maturity of the Convertible Senior Notes and the
    2023 Notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock,
    other of our securities or other instruments they may wish to
    use in connection with such hedging. Any of these transactions
    and activities could adversely affect the value of our common
    stock and, as a result, the number of shares and the value of
    the common stock holders will receive upon conversion of the
    Convertible Senior Notes and the 2023 Notes. In addition,
    subject to movement in the price of our common stock, if the
    hedge transactions settle in our favor, we could be exposed to
    credit risk related to the other party with respect to the
    payment we are owed from such other party.

Rating
    agencies may provide unsolicited ratings on the Convertible
    Senior Notes that could reduce the market value or liquidity of
    our common stock.

We have not requested a rating of the Convertible Senior Notes
    from any rating agency and we do not anticipate that the
    Convertible Senior Notes will be rated. However, if one or more
    rating agencies independently elects to rate the Convertible
    Senior Notes and assigns the Convertible Senior Notes a rating
    lower than the rating expected by investors, or reduces such
    rating in the future, the market price or liquidity of the
    Convertible Senior Notes and our common stock could be harmed.
    Should a decline in the market price of the Convertible Senior
    Notes result, as compared to the price of our common stock, this
    may trigger the right of the holders of the Convertible Senior
    Notes to convert the Convertible Senior Notes into cash and
    shares of our common stock.

Anti-takeover
    defenses in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and
    certain provisions under Delaware law could prevent an
    acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors
    might be willing to pay for our common stock.

Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain
    provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law that apply to
    us could make it difficult for another company to acquire
    control of our company. For example:

•

Our certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors
    to issue, at any time and without stockholder approval,
    preferred stock with such terms as it may determine. No shares
    of preferred stock are currently outstanding. However, the
    rights of holders of any of our preferred stock that may be
    issued in the future may be superior to the rights of holders of
    our common stock.

•

Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
    generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any
    business combination with a person owning 15% or more of its
    voting stock, or who is affiliated with the corporation and
    owned 15% or more of its voting stock at any time within three
    years prior to the proposed business combination, for a period
    of three years from the date the person became a 15% owner,
    unless specified conditions are met.

All or any one of these factors could limit the price that
    certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of our
    common stock and could delay, prevent or allow our board of
    directors to resist an acquisition of our company, even if a
    proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our
    independent stockholders.

Item 2.
    Properties

We own land and buildings at our headquarters campus, which is
    located in San Jose, California. We also own buildings in
    India. As of December 29, 2007, the total square footage of
    our owned buildings was approximately 750,000, with an
    additional 208,000 square feet under construction at our
    headquarters campus.

In January 2007, we completed the sale of certain of our land
    and buildings in San Jose, California. Concurrently with
    the sale, we leased back from the purchaser all available space
    in the buildings. The lease agreement includes an initial term
    of two years, with two options to extend the lease for six
    months each. We will use the approximately 262,500 square
    feet of leased space until the facility construction described
    above is completed.

We lease additional facilities in the United States and various
    other countries. We sublease certain of these facilities where
    space is not fully utilized or has been involved in
    restructuring activities.

We believe that these facilities and the facility under
    construction at our headquarters campus are adequate for our
    current needs and that suitable additional or substitute space
    will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of our
    operations.

Item 3.
    Legal Proceedings

From time to time, we are involved in various disputes and
    litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of
    business. These include disputes and lawsuits related to
    intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, licensing,
    contracts, distribution arrangements and employee relations
    matters. At least quarterly, we review the status of each
    significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure.
    If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is
    considered probable and the amount or the range of loss can be
    estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss in
    accordance with SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for
    Contingencies.” Legal proceedings are subject to
    uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to predict.
    Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based only on the
    best information available at the time. As additional
    information becomes available, we reassess the potential
    liability related to pending claims and litigation matters and
    may revise estimates.

On February 8, 2007, we, Magma Design Automation, Inc., or
    Magma, Altera Corp., or Altera, and Mentor Graphics Corp., or
    Mentor, filed a complaint in the United States District Court
    for the Northern District of California against an individual,
    Narpat Bhandari, or Bhandari, and Vanguard Systems, Inc., or
    Vanguard. The complaint sought a declaratory judgment that
    U.S. Patent No. 5,663,900, or the ’900 Patent,
    which discloses an electronic simulation and emulation system
    and is allegedly owned by Bhandari and Vanguard, is not
    infringed and is invalid and unenforceable. The Complaint
    further sought a declaratory judgment that LSI Logic
    Corporation, or LSI, has an ownership interest in the ’900
    Patent that precludes Bhandari and Vanguard from asserting the
    patent without first joining LSI. In March 2007, Cadence, Magma,
    Altera and Mentor amended the complaint to further plead
    non-infringement on the basis of obtaining a license to the
    ’900 Patent from its co-owner, LSI. In April 2007, Bhandari
    and Vanguard answered the amended complaint, asserting
    counterclaims alleging that certain products of ours and the
    other plaintiffs infringed the ’900 Patent. In a case
    management conference held on May 21, 2007, the court
    granted the request of us, Magma, Altera and Mentor to bifurcate
    the case and stay all issues except for the question of
    LSI’s ownership interest in the ’900 Patent. We,
    Magma, Altera and Mentor filed a Motion for Summary Judgment
    that LSI was a joint-owner and that the license from LSI
    warranted dismissal of Bhandari and Vanguard’s claim, which
    the court granted in favor of us, Magma, Altera and Mentor. On
    December 4, 2007, the court issued an order entering
    judgment in favor of us, Magma, Altera and Mentor and against
    Bhandari and Vanguard, thus bringing this matter to a close.

On May 30, 2007, Ahmed Higazi, a former Cadence employee,
    filed suit against us in the United States District Court for
    the Northern District of California alleging that we improperly
    classified him and a class of other Cadence information
    technology employees as exempt from overtime pay. The suit
    alleges claims for unpaid overtime under the federal Fair Labor
    Standards Act and California law, waiting-time penalties under
    the California Labor Code, failure to provide proper earnings
    statements under California law, failure to provide meal periods
    and rest breaks as required by California law, unfair business
    practices under California Business & Professions Code
    section 17200, and



unpaid 401(k) contributions in violation of the Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. On June 20, 2007,
    we answered plaintiff’s complaint, denying its material
    allegations and raising a number of affirmative defenses, and on
    December 19, 2007, we filed an amended answer. A period of
    discovery conducted by both sides then ensued, followed, in
    January 2008, by a private mediation of the case. At the
    mediation, the parties were successful in resolving their
    respective differences, and have entered into a settlement
    agreement without contesting the merits of the claims or
    admitting liability

.

The parties are in the process of
    preparing the various papers for court approval of the
    settlement. Final approval is not expected to occur until the
    third quarter of 2008.

While the outcome of these disputes and litigation matters
    cannot be predicted with any certainty, management does not
    believe that the outcome of any current matters will have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position,
    liquidity or results of operations.

    fiscal year. FIN No. 48 prescribes a new recognition
    threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
    recognition and measurement of an income tax position taken or
    expected to be taken in a tax return. The cumulative effect of
    applying the provisions of FIN No. 48 have been
    reported as an adjustment to our opening balance of retained
    earnings or other appropriate components of equity or net assets
    in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the beginning of fiscal
    year 2007.

Overview

We develop electronic design automation, or EDA, software and
    hardware. We license software, sell or lease hardware
    technology, provide maintenance for our software and hardware
    and provide design, methodology and education services
    throughout the world to help manage and accelerate electronics
    product development processes. Our broad range of products and
    services are used by the world’s leading electronics
    companies to design and develop complex integrated circuits, or
    ICs, and electronics systems.

With the addition of emerging nanometer design considerations to
    the already burgeoning set of traditional design tasks, complex
    SoC or IC design can no longer be accomplished using a
    collection of discrete design tools. What previously consisted
    of sequential design activities must be merged and accomplished
    nearly simultaneously without time-consuming data translation
    steps. We combine our design technologies into
    “platforms” addressing four major design activities:
    functional verification, digital IC design, custom IC design and
    system interconnect design. The four Cadence design platforms
    are Incisive functional verification, Encounter digital IC
    design, Virtuoso custom design and Allegro system interconnect
    design platforms. In addition, we augment these platform product
    offerings with a comprehensive set of DFM products that service
    both the digital and custom IC design flows. These four
    platforms, together with our DFM products, comprise our primary
    product lines.

Digital implementation was the fastest growing product group in
    2007 in terms of revenue, driven by the focus on complex chips,
    advanced nodes and low power. Design challenges at the 65
    nanometer and 45 nanometer process nodes drove upgrades in the
    digital, custom and DFM product groups. Also during 2007, the
    Allegro system interconnect design platform had a complete
    technology update and the custom simulation business had a
    significant product update.

We have identified certain items that management uses as
    performance indicators to manage our business, including
    revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow
    from operations, and we describe these items more fully below
    under the heading “Results of Operations” below.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates

In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we make
    assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant
    impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well
    as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. We base our assumptions, judgments
    and estimates on historical experience and various other factors
    that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
    results could differ materially from these estimates under
    different assumptions or conditions. At least quarterly, we
    evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates and make
    changes accordingly. We believe that the assumptions, judgments
    and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue
    recognition, accounting for income taxes and valuation of
    stock-based awards have the greatest potential impact on our
    Consolidated Financial Statements; therefore, we consider these
    to be our critical accounting estimates. Historically, our
    assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical
    accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual
    results. For further information on our significant accounting
    policies, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Revenue
    recognition

We apply the provisions of Statement of Position, or SOP,

97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by

SOP 98-9,

“Modification of

SOP 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain
    Transactions,” to all software licensing transactions and
    to all product revenue transactions where the software is not
    incidental. We also apply the provisions of
    SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases,” to all
    hardware lease transactions. We recognize revenue when
    persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has
    been delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection of
    the resulting receivable is probable, and vendor-specific
    objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE, exists.

We license software using three different license types:

•

Subscription licenses;

•

Term licenses; and

•

Perpetual licenses.

For many of our term and subscription license arrangements, we
    use our proprietary internet-based delivery mechanism,

“eDA-on-tap,”

to facilitate the delivery of our software products. To maximize
    the efficiency of this



delivery mechanism, we created what we refer to as “eDA
    Cards,” of which there are two types. Subscription license
    customers may purchase what we refer to as an “eDA Platinum
    Card,” which provides the customer access to and use of all
    software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement and
    the ability to use additional unspecified software products that
    may become commercially available during the term of the
    arrangement. Term license customers may purchase what we refer
    to as an “eDA Gold Card,” which provides the customer
    access to and use of all software products delivered at the
    outset of the arrangement. Overall, the eDA Cards provide
    greater flexibility for our customers in how and when they
    deploy and use our software products.

Subscription licenses

– Our subscription
    license arrangements offer our customers the right to:

•

Access and use all software products delivered at the outset of
    an arrangement throughout the entire term of the arrangement,
    generally two to four years, with no rights to return;

•

Use unspecified additional software products that become
    commercially available during the term of the
    arrangement; and

•

Remix among the software products delivered at the outset of the
    arrangement, as well as the right to remix into other
    unspecified additional software products that may become
    available during the term of the arrangement, so long as the
    cumulative value of all products in use does not exceed the
    total license fee determined at the outset of the arrangement.
    These remix rights may be exercisable multiple times during the
    term of the arrangement. The right to remix all software
    products delivered pursuant to the license agreement is not
    considered an exchange or return of software because all
    software products have been delivered and the customer has the
    continuing right to use them.

Customers that purchase an eDA Platinum Card have the ability
    during the term of the arrangement to use software products
    delivered at the outset of the arrangement, and to use other
    unspecified additional software products that may become
    commercially available during the term of the arrangement, until
    the fees have been depleted.

In general, revenue associated with subscription licenses is
    recognized ratably over the term of the license commencing upon
    the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery
    of the software product. Subscription license revenue is
    allocated to product and maintenance revenue. The allocation to
    maintenance revenue is based on vendor specific objective
    evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of the undelivered maintenance
    that was established in connection with the sale of our term
    licenses.

In the event that a subscription license arrangement is
    terminated by mutual agreement and a new term license
    arrangement is entered into either concurrently with or
    subsequent to the termination of the subscription license
    arrangement, the revenue associated with the new term license
    arrangement is recognized upon the later of the effective date
    of the arrangement or delivery of the software product, assuming
    all other criteria in

SOP 97-2

have been met.

Term licenses

– Our term license arrangements
    offer our customers the right to:

•

Access and use all software products delivered at the outset of
    an arrangement throughout the entire term of the arrangement,
    generally two to four years, with no rights to return; and

•

Remix among the software products delivered at the outset of the
    arrangement, so long as the cumulative value of all products in
    use does not exceed the total license fee determined at the
    outset of the arrangement. These remix rights may be exercisable
    multiple times during the term of the arrangement. The right to
    remix all software products delivered pursuant to the license
    agreement is not considered an exchange or return of software
    because all software products have been delivered and the
    customer has the continuing right to use them.

Customers that purchase an eDA Gold Card have the ability during
    the term of the arrangement to use software products delivered
    at the outset of the arrangement until the fees relating to the
    arrangement have been depleted.

In general, revenue associated with term licenses is recognized
    upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or
    delivery of the software product.

Perpetual licenses

– Our perpetual licenses
    consist of software licensed on a perpetual basis with no right
    to return or exchange the licensed software. In general, revenue
    associated with perpetual licenses is recognized upon the later
    of the effective date of the license or delivery of the licensed
    product.



Persuasive evidence of an arrangement

–
    Generally, we use a contract signed by the customer as evidence
    of an arrangement for subscription and term licenses and
    hardware leases. If a contract signed by the customer does not
    exist, we have historically used a purchase order as evidence of
    an arrangement for perpetual licenses, hardware sales,
    maintenance renewals and small fixed-price service projects,
    such as training classes and small methodology service
    engagements of approximately $10,000 or less. For all other
    service engagements, we use a signed professional services
    agreement and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement. In
    cases where both a signed contract and a purchase order exist,
    we consider the signed contract to be the most persuasive
    evidence of the arrangement. Sales through our distributors are
    evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship,
    together with binding purchase orders from the distributor on a

transaction-by-transaction

basis.

Product delivery

– Software and the
    corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers
    electronically. Electronic delivery occurs when we provide the
    customer access to the software. Occasionally, we will deliver
    the software on a compact disc with standard transfer terms of

free-on-board,

or F.O.B., shipping point. Our software license agreements
    generally do not contain conditions for acceptance. With respect
    to hardware, delivery of an entire system is deemed to occur
    upon its successful installation. For certain hardware products,
    installation is the responsibility of the customer, as the
    system is fully functional at the time of shipment. For these
    products, delivery is deemed to be complete when the products
    are shipped with freight terms of F.O.B. shipping point.

For customers who purchase eDA Gold or eDA Platinum Cards,
    delivery occurs when the customer has been provided with access
    codes that allow the customer to download the software pursuant
    to the terms of the software license agreement.

Fee is fixed or determinable

– We assess
    whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the
    arrangement, primarily based on the payment terms associated
    with the transaction. We have established a history of
    collecting under the original contract without providing
    concessions on payments, products or services. For our
    installment contracts that do not include a substantial up front
    payment, we only consider that a fee is fixed or determinable if
    the arrangement has payment periods that are equal to or less
    than the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in
    equal or nearly equal installments, when evaluated over the
    entire term of the arrangement. We have a history of collecting
    receivables under installment contracts of up to five years.

Significant judgment is involved in assessing whether a fee is
    fixed or determinable. We must also make these judgments when
    assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement
    (primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal)
    constitutes a concession. Our experience has been that we are
    able to determine whether a fee is fixed or determinable for
    term licenses. While we do not expect that experience to change,
    if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the
    original contract without providing concessions on term
    licenses, revenue from term licenses would be required to be
    recognized when payments under the installment contract become
    due and payable. Such a change could have a material impact on
    our results of operations.

Collection is probable

– We assess the
    probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of
    the arrangement based on a number of factors, including the
    customer’s payment history and its current
    creditworthiness. We have concluded that collection is not
    probable for license arrangements executed with customers in
    certain countries. If in our judgment collection of a fee is not
    probable, we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed,
    which generally means revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash
    payment. Our experience has been that we are able to estimate
    whether collection is probable. While we do not expect that
    experience to change, if we were to determine that collection is
    not probable for any license arrangement, particularly those
    with installment payment terms, revenue from such license would
    be recognized generally upon the receipt of cash payment. Such a
    change could have a material impact on our results of operations.

Vendor-specific objective evidence of fair
    value

– Our VSOE for certain product elements of
    an arrangement is based upon the pricing in comparable
    transactions when the element is sold separately. VSOE for
    maintenance is generally based upon the customer’s stated
    annual renewal rates. VSOE for services is generally based on
    the price charged when the services are sold separately. For
    multiple element arrangements, VSOE must exist to allocate the
    total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of a term
    or perpetual license arrangement. If VSOE does not exist for all
    elements to support the allocation of the total fee among all
    delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement, revenue
    is deferred until such evidence does exist for the undelivered
    elements, or until all elements are delivered, whichever is
    earlier. If VSOE of all undelivered elements exists but VSOE
    does not exist for one or



more delivered elements, revenue is recognized using the
    residual method. Under the residual method, the VSOE of the
    undelivered elements is deferred, and the remaining portion of
    the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue as the elements are
    delivered. Our experience has been that we are able to determine
    VSOE for maintenance and time-based services, but not for
    product.

Finance fee revenue

– Finance fees result from
    discounting to present value the product revenue derived from
    our installment contracts in which the payment terms extend
    beyond one year from the effective date of the contract. Finance
    fees are recognized using a method that approximates the
    effective interest method over the relevant license term and are
    classified as product revenue. Finance fee revenue represented
    approximately 2% of total revenue for each of the years ended
    December 29, 2007, December 30, 2006 and
    December 31, 2005. Upon the sale of an installment
    contract, we recognize the remaining finance fee revenue
    associated with the installment contract.

Services revenue

– Services revenue consists
    primarily of revenue received for performing design and
    methodology services. These services are not related to the
    functionality of the products licensed. Revenue from service
    contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method,
    as work is performed, or on the percentage-of-completion method.
    For contracts with fixed or not-to-exceed fees, we estimate on a
    monthly basis the percentage-of-completion, which is based on
    the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement. We
    have a history of accurately estimating project status and the
    costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and
    external factors can affect our estimates, including labor
    rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification
    and testing requirement changes. If different conditions were to
    prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made, then the
    use of the completed contract method would be required and the
    recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the
    project was completed. Such a change could have a material
    impact on our results of operations.

Accounting
    for income taxes

We provide for the effect of income taxes in our Consolidated
    Financial Statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
    “Accounting for Income Taxes” and FIN No. 48.

Under SFAS No. 109, income tax expense or benefit is
    recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the
    current year, and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for
    the tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an
    entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We must make
    significant assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine
    our current provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets
    and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded
    against our deferred tax assets. Our judgments, assumptions and
    estimates relating to the current provision for income taxes
    include the geographic mix and amount of income, our
    interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of
    current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax
    authorities. Our judgments also include anticipating the tax
    positions we will take on tax returns prior to actually
    preparing and filing the tax returns. Changes in our business,
    tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws, and developments in
    current and future tax audits, could significantly impact the
    amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations,
    financial position or cash flows. Our assumptions, judgments and
    estimates relating to the value of our net deferred tax assets
    take into account predictions of the amount and category of
    future taxable income from various sources, including tax
    planning strategies that would, if necessary, be implemented to
    prevent a loss carryforward or tax credit carryforward from
    expiring unused. Actual operating results or other events that
    cause us to change our expectations of the amount and category
    of income in future years could render our current assumptions,
    judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes
    inaccurate, thus materially affecting our consolidated financial
    position or results of operations.

Under FIN No. 48, we may only recognize an income tax
    position in our financial statements that we judge is “more
    likely than not” to be sustained solely on its technical
    merits in a tax audit including resolution of any related
    appeals or litigation processes. To make this judgment, we must
    interpret the application of complex and sometimes ambiguous tax
    laws, regulations, and practices. If an income tax position
    meets the “more likely than not” recognition
    threshold, then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to
    be recognized by determining the largest amount of tax benefit
    that has a greater than a 50% likelihood of being realized upon
    effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full
    knowledge of all of the relevant facts. It is inherently
    difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this
    requires us to determine the probability of various possible
    settlement outcomes. To determine if a tax position is
    effectively settled, we must also estimate the likelihood that a
    taxing authority would review a tax position after a tax
    examination had otherwise been completed. We must also determine
    when it is



reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits
    will significantly increase or decrease in the 12 months
    after each reporting date. These judgments are difficult because
    a taxing authority may change its behavior as a result of our
    disclosures in our financial statements that are based on the
    requirements of FIN No. 48. We must re-evaluate our
    income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors
    such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law,
    effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity.
    Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in
    recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax
    provision.

Valuation
    of stock-based awards

We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the
    fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R,
    “Share-Based Payment.” Under SFAS No. 123R,
    stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date
    based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense
    over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of
    stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment,
    including estimating the following:

•

Expected volatility of our stock;

•

Expected term of stock options;

•

Risk-free interest rate for the period;

•

Expected dividends, if any; and

•

Expected forfeitures.

The computation of the expected volatility assumption used in
    the Black-Scholes pricing model for option grants is based on
    implied volatility calculated using the volatility of publicly
    traded options for our common stock. We use this approach to
    determine volatility because:

•

Options for our common stock are actively traded;

•

The market prices of both the traded options and underlying
    shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and
    on a date reasonably close to the grant date of the employee
    stock options;

•

The traded options have exercise prices that are both
    near-the-money and close to the exercise price of the employee
    stock options; and

•

The remaining maturities of the traded options on which the
    estimate is based are at least one year.

When establishing the expected life assumption, we review annual
    historical employee exercise behavior with respect to option
    grants having similar vesting periods. In addition, judgment is
    required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that we
    expect to be forfeited. We calculate a separate expected
    forfeiture rate for both stock options and restricted stock
    issuances based on historical trends. The valuation of all
    options and the expected forfeiture rates for options and
    restricted stock are calculated based on one employee pool as
    there is no significant difference in exercise behavior between
    classes of employees. Of the $101.4 million of stock-based
    compensation expense recorded during 2007, we used the current
    year valuation assumptions described above for
    $17.8 million of our 2007 stock-based compensation expense
    for options granted during 2007, and we used prior year
    valuation assumptions for $31.2 million of our 2007
    stock-based compensation expense for options granted prior to
    2007. In addition, we expensed $42.8 million in 2007
    related to restricted stock and $9.6 million related to the
    performance-based bonus plan described below.

Judgment is also required to estimate the attainment of certain
    predetermined performance goals for a performance-based bonus
    plan under which payments may be made in our common stock. Each
    period, we estimate the most likely outcome of such performance
    goals and recognize any related stock-based compensation
    expense. The amount of stock-based compensation expense
    recognized in any one period can vary based on the attainment or
    estimated attainment of the various performance goals. If such
    performance goals are not met, no compensation expense is
    recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is
    reversed.

If actual results differ significantly from these estimates,
    stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations
    could be materially affected.

Results
    of Operations

We primarily generate revenue from licensing our EDA software,
    selling or leasing our hardware technology, providing
    maintenance for our software and hardware and providing design
    and methodology services. We



principally utilize three license types: subscription, term and
    perpetual. The different license types provide a customer with
    different terms of use for our products, such as:

•

The right to access new technology;

•

The duration of the license; and

•

Payment terms.

Customer decisions regarding these aspects of license
    transactions determine the license type, timing of revenue
    recognition and potential future business activity. For example,
    if a customer chooses a fixed term of use, this will result in
    either a subscription or term license. A business implication of
    this decision is that, at the expiration of the license period,
    the customer must decide whether to continue using the
    technology and therefore renew the license agreement. Because
    larger customers generally use products from two or more of our
    five product groups, rarely will a large customer completely
    terminate its relationship with us at expiration of the license.
    See the discussion under the heading “Critical Accounting
    Estimates” above for an additional description of license
    types and timing of revenue recognition.

Although we believe that pricing volatility has not generally
    been a material component of the change in our revenue from
    period to period, we believe that the amount of revenue
    recognized in future periods will depend on, among other things,
    the competitiveness of our new technology, the length of our
    sales cycle, and the size, duration, terms, type and timing of
    our:

•

Contract renewals with existing customers;

•

Additional sales to existing customers; and

•

Sales to new customers.

A substantial portion of our total revenue is recognized over
    multiple periods. However, a significant portion of our product
    revenue is recognized upon delivery of licensed software, which
    generally occurs upon the later of the effective date of the
    arrangement or delivery of the software product.

The value and duration of contracts, and consequently product
    revenue recognized, is affected by the competitiveness of our
    products. Product revenue recognized in any period is also
    affected by the extent to which customers purchase subscription,
    term or perpetual licenses, and the extent to which contracts
    contain flexible payment terms. The timing of revenue
    recognition is also affected by changes in the extent to which
    existing contracts contain flexible payment terms and by changes
    in contractual arrangements with existing customers (e.g.,
    customers transitioning from subscription license arrangements
    to term license arrangements).

Revenue
    and Revenue Mix

We analyze our software and hardware businesses by product
    group, combining revenues for both product and maintenance
    because of their interrelationship. We have formulated a design
    solution strategy that combines our design technologies into
    “platforms,” which are included in the various product
    groups described below.

Our product groups are:

Functional Verification:

Products in this group,
    which include the Incisive functional verification platform, are
    used to verify that the high level, logical representation of an
    IC design is functionally correct.

Digital IC Design:

Products in this group, which
    include the Encounter digital IC design platform, are used to
    accurately convert the high-level, logical representation of a
    digital IC into a detailed physical blueprint and then detailed
    design information showing how the IC will be physically
    implemented. This data is used for creation of the photomasks
    used in chip manufacture.

Custom IC Design:

Our custom design products, which
    include the Virtuoso custom design platform, are used for ICs
    that must be designed at the transistor level, including analog,
    radio frequency, memories, high performance digital blocks and
    standard cell libraries. Detailed design information showing how
    an IC will be physically implemented is used for creation of the
    photomasks used in chip manufacture.

System Interconnect Design:

This product group
    consists of our PCB and IC package design products, including
    the Allegro and OrCAD products. The Allegro system interconnect
    design platform enables consistent co-design of interconnects
    across ICs, IC packages and PCBs, while the OrCAD line focuses
    on cost-effective, entry-level PCB solutions.



Design for Manufacturing:

Included in this product
    group are our physical verification and analysis products. These
    products are used to analyze and verify that the physical
    blueprint of the integrated circuit has been constructed
    correctly and can be manufactured successfully.

Revenue
    by Year

    compared to 2006

Product revenue was higher in 2007, as compared to 2006,
    primarily because of increased revenue from licenses for Digital
    IC Design, Functional Verification and Custom IC Design
    products, partially offset by a small decrease in revenue from
    licenses for DFM products. Digital IC Design was the fastest
    growing platform in 2007.

    compared to 2005

Product revenue was higher in 2006, as compared to 2005,

As described under the heading “Critical Accounting
    Estimates” above, certain of our licenses allow customers
    the ability to remix among software products. Additionally, we
    have licensed a combination of our products to customers with
    the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be
    determined at a later date. For these arrangements, we estimate
    the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the
    expected usage of our products by these customers. The actual
    usage of our products by these customers may differ and, if that
    proves to be the case, the revenue allocation in the above table
    would differ.

Although we believe the methodology of allocating revenue to
    product groups is reasonable, there can be no assurance that
    such allocated amounts reflect the amounts that would result had
    the customer individually licensed each specific software
    solution at the onset of the arrangement.

The rate of revenue change varies geographically primarily due
    to differences in the timing and size of term licenses in those
    regions. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of total
    revenue in 2007, 2006 or 2005.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates caused our revenue to
    increase by $2.9 million in 2007 compared to 2006,
    primarily due to a decrease in the valuation of the United
    States dollar when compared to the European Union euro and the
    British pound, partially offset by an increase in the valuation
    of the United States dollar when compared to the Japanese yen.
    Changes in foreign currency exchange rates caused our revenue to
    decrease $12.0 million in 2006 as compared to 2005
    primarily due to an increase in the valuation of the United
    States dollar when compared to the Japanese yen. Additional
    information about revenue and other financial information by
    geography can be found in Note 22 to our Consolidated

Cost of product includes costs associated with the sale or lease
    of our hardware and licensing of our software products. Cost of
    product primarily includes the cost of employee salary, benefits
    and other employee-related costs, including stock-based
    compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangibles
    directly related to Cadence products, the cost of technical
    documentation and royalties payable to third-party vendors. Cost
    of product associated with our hardware products also includes
    materials, assembly and overhead. These additional manufacturing
    costs make our cost of hardware product higher, as a percentage
    of revenue, than our cost of software product.

    compared to 2006

Cost of product decreased $6.7 million in 2007 as compared
    to 2006, primarily due to:

•

A decrease of $10.9 million in amortization of acquired
    intangible assets because certain acquired intangible assets
    became fully amortized during the period; partially offset by

•

An increase of $5.0 million in hardware costs attributable
    to increased hardware sales.

    compared to 2005

Cost of product decreased $12.9 million in 2006 as compared
    to 2005, primarily due to:

•

A decrease of $13.8 million in amortization of acquired
    intangible assets because certain acquired intangible assets
    became fully amortized during the period; partially offset by

•

An increase of $5.3 million in hardware costs attributable
    to increased hardware sales.

Cost of product depends primarily upon the extent to which we
    acquire intangible assets, acquire licenses and incorporate
    third-party technology in our products that are licensed or sold
    in any given period, and the actual mix of hardware and software
    product sales in any given period.

Cost of services primarily includes employee salary, benefits
    and other employee-related costs, costs to maintain the
    infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization, and
    provisions for contract losses, if any. There were no material
    fluctuations in these components of Cost of services during
    2007, as compared to 2006, or during 2006, as compared to 2005.

Cost of maintenance includes the cost of customer services, such
    as hot-line and

on-site

support, employee salary, benefits and other employee-related
    costs, and documentation of maintenance updates. There were no



material fluctuations in these components of Cost of maintenance
    during 2007, as compared to 2006, or during 2006, as compared to
    2005.

Restructuring
    and Other Charges

We initiated a separate plan of restructuring in each year from
    2001 through 2005 in an effort to operate more efficiently. A
    summary of Restructuring and other charges in fiscal years 2007,
    2006 and 2005 is as follows:

On October 5, 2007, we completed a lease termination
    agreement for a facility included in the 2001 restructuring
    plan, whereby we paid $8.2 million and were released from
    all future obligations related to the facility. We recorded a
    credit to Restructuring and other charges of $7.1 million
    during the year ended December 29, 2007, representing the
    lease loss accrual related to this facility in excess of the
    amount paid.

During 2005, we recorded Restructuring and other charges of
    $35.3 million, which included $20.4 million of
    workforce reduction costs associated primarily with our 2005
    restructuring plan, and excess facility costs of
    $12.5 million, which consisted primarily of changes in
    lease loss estimates for facilities included in our 2001, 2002
    and 2003 restructuring plans.

Each reporting period, we evaluate the adequacy of the lease
    loss accrual. We adjust the lease loss accrual for changes in
    real estate markets or other factors that may affect estimated
    costs or sublease income. We also consider executed sublease
    agreements and adjust the lease loss accrual if sublease income
    under the agreement differs from initial estimates. The credits
    recorded during 2007 and 2006 primarily relate to changes in
    lease loss estimates.

As of December 29, 2007, our total amount accrued for
    restructuring and other charges of $10.2 million consisted
    solely of estimated lease losses related to the restructuring
    activities initiated since 2001. This amount may be adjusted in
    the future based upon changes in the assumptions used to
    estimate the lease loss.

Because the restructuring charges and related benefits are
    derived from management’s estimates made during the
    formulation of the restructurings, based on then-currently
    available information, our restructuring activities may not
    achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the
    level contemplated. Demand for our products and



services and, ultimately, our future financial performance, is
    difficult to predict with any degree of certainty. Accordingly,
    additional actions, including further restructuring of our
    operations, may be required in the future.

Write-off
    of Acquired In-Process Research and Development

Upon consummation of an acquisition, we immediately charge to
    expense any acquired in-process research and development that
    has not yet reached technological feasibility and has no
    alternative future use. The value assigned to acquired
    in-process research and development is determined by identifying
    research projects in areas for which technological feasibility
    has not been established. The values are determined by
    estimating costs to develop the acquired in-process research and
    development into commercially viable products, estimating the
    resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the
    net cash flows back to their present value. The discount rates
    utilized include a factor that reflects the uncertainty
    surrounding successful development of the acquired in-process
    research and development.

    in-process research and development charges in fiscal 2007, 2006

The increases in interest income in 2007, as compared to 2006,
    and in 2006, as compared to 2005, were due to increases in our
    Cash and cash equivalents balances as well as higher interest
    rates applicable to those balances.

In January 2006, KhiMetrics, Inc., a cost method investment held
    by Telos Venture Partners, a limited partnership in which we and
    our 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment Plan Trust are
    the sole limited partners, was sold for consideration of $6.53
    per share of common stock. In connection with this sale, we
    received approximately $20.2 million in cash and recorded a
    gain of approximately $17.1 million during the year ended
    December 30, 2006. In addition, our 1996 Deferred
    Compensation Venture Investment Plan Trust received
    $2.9 million in cash and recorded a gain of
    $2.5 million during the year ended December 30, 2006.
    Under the purchase agreement, an additional 10% of the
    consideration was held in escrow, which was released to us and
    to the trust in January 2007. Upon receipt of these additional
    proceeds, we recorded a gain of $2.6 million and our 1996
    Deferred Compensation Venture Investment Plan Trust recorded a
    gain of $0.4 million in the year ended December 29,
    2007.

Provision
    for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes and the effective tax rates in
    fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 were as follows:

    compared to 2006

Our effective tax rate decreased in 2007, as compared to 2006,
    primarily due to the decrease in net unrecognized tax benefit of
    $27.8 million as a result of the effective settlement of
    certain tax matters with the IRS in December 2007 and an
    increase in benefit from foreign income, which is taxed at a
    lower rate than the United States federal statutory income tax
    rate, of $30.6 million, resulting from the conclusion of
    certain transfer pricing arrangements with a foreign subsidiary
    in 2006.

We currently expect the effective tax rate for 2008 to be
    approximately 33%. The increase in the expected 2008 effective
    tax rate, as compared to 2007, is primarily due to the 2007
    effective settlement of certain tax positions with the IRS and
    the expiration of the federal research tax credits after
    December 31, 2007, neither of which is expected to provide
    tax benefits in 2008.

    compared to 2005

Our effective tax rate decreased in 2006, as compared to 2005,
    primarily due to the $30.1 million of federal, state and
    foreign income taxes incurred upon our 2005 repatriation of
    $500.0 million of certain foreign earnings under the
    American Jobs Creation Act, which increased the 2005 annual
    effective tax rate by approximately 23 percentage points.

Deferred
    Tax Assets and IRS Examinations

As of December 29, 2007, we had total net deferred tax
    assets of approximately $250.6 million. Realization of the
    deferred tax assets will depend on generating sufficient taxable
    income of the appropriate character prior to the expiration of
    certain net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit
    carryforwards. Although realization is not assured, we believe
    it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will
    be realized. The amount of the net deferred tax assets, however,
    could be reduced or increased in the near term if actual facts,
    including the estimate of future taxable income, differ from
    those estimated.

The Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and other tax authorities
    regularly examine our income tax returns. In November 2003, the
    IRS completed its field examination of our federal income tax
    returns for the tax years 1997 through 1999 and issued a Revenue
    Agent’s Report, or RAR, in which the IRS proposed to assess
    an aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period of
    approximately $143.0 million. The most significant of the
    disputed adjustments for the tax years 1997 through 1999 related
    to transfer pricing arrangements that we had with a foreign
    subsidiary. In December 2007, the Joint Committee on Taxation of
    the U.S. Congress, or the Joint Committee, approved and the
    Appeals Office executed settlement agreements resulting in an
    effective settlement of the transfer pricing dispute for
    purposes of FIN No. 48. As a result of this effective
    settlement, we recognized a tax benefit of $27.8 million in
    our Consolidated Income Statement.

We did not reach a settlement with the Appeals Office of the IRS
    on separate tax refund claims that would increase our tax
    deductions for foreign trade income for the tax years 1997
    through 1999. We continue to believe that our position is well
    supported and we are currently considering our options for
    further pursuing this matter.

In July 2006, the IRS completed its field examination of our
    federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002
    and issued an RAR in which the IRS proposed to assess an
    aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period of
    approximately $324.0 million. In November 2006, the IRS
    revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year
    period to be approximately $318.0 million. The IRS is
    contesting our qualification for deferred recognition of certain
    proceeds received from restitution and settlement in connection
    with litigation during the period. The proposed tax deficiency
    for this item is approximately $152.0 million. The
    remaining proposed tax deficiency of approximately
    $166.0 million is primarily related to proposed adjustments
    to our transfer pricing arrangements that we had with foreign
    subsidiaries and to our deductions for foreign trade income. The
    IRS may make similar claims against our transfer pricing
    arrangements and deductions for foreign trade income in future
    examinations. We have filed a timely protest with the IRS and
    will seek resolution of the issues with the Appeals Office.

We believe that the proposed IRS adjustments are inconsistent
    with applicable tax laws and we are vigorously challenging these
    proposed adjustments. The RAR is not a final Statutory Notice of
    Deficiency but the IRS imposes interest on the proposed
    deficiencies until the matters are resolved. Interest is
    compounded daily at rates published



by the IRS, which rates are adjusted quarterly and have been
    between 4% and 10% since 2001. The IRS is currently examining
    our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2003 through
    2005.

Significant judgment is required in applying the principles of
    FIN No. 48 and SFAS No. 109. The calculation
    of our provision for income taxes involves dealing with
    uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and
    regulations. In determining the adequacy of our provision for
    income taxes, we regularly assess the potential settlement
    outcomes resulting from income tax examinations. However, the
    final outcome of tax examinations, including the total amount
    payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of
    these issues, cannot be estimated with certainty. In addition,
    we cannot be certain that such amount will not be materially
    different than that which is reflected in our historical income
    tax provisions and accruals. Should the IRS or other tax
    authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a current or
    a future examination, we may be required to record charges to
    operations in future periods that could have a material impact
    on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows
    in the applicable period or periods.

Cash,

As of December 29, 2007, our principal sources of liquidity
    consisted of $1,078.1 million of Cash and cash equivalents
    and Short-term investments, as compared to $958.4 million
    as of December 30, 2006 and $894.6 million as of
    December 31, 2005. The primary sources of our cash in 2007
    and 2006 were:

•

Customer payments under software licenses and from the sale or
    lease of our hardware products;

•

Customer payments for design and methodology services;

•

Proceeds from the sale of receivables;

•

Proceeds from the sale of land and buildings on our
    San Jose campus in 2007;

•

Proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes in
    2006;

•

Proceeds from the separate warrant sale transactions entered
    into in connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior
    Notes in 2006;

•

Proceeds from the termination of a portion of the hedge
    transactions originally entered into in connection with the
    issuance of our 2023 Notes in 2006;

•

Proceeds from the exercise of stock options; and

•

Common stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plans.

Our primary uses of cash in 2007 and 2006 consisted of:

•

Payments relating to payroll, product, services and other
    operating expenses;

•

Payments of taxes;

•

Purchases of property, plant and equipment, including payments
    associated with our construction of a new building on our
    headquarters campus in San Jose;

•

Payments of long-term debt and repurchases of a portion of the
    2023 Notes;

•

Payments made to purchase hedges in connection with our issuance
    of the Convertible Senior Notes in 2006;

•

Payments made to terminate a portion of the warrant transactions
    originally entered in connection with the issuance of our 2023
    Notes in 2006;

•

Purchases of treasury stock; and



•

Payments related to business acquisitions, asset acquisitions
    and intangible acquisitions.

Cash
    flows from operating activities

Cash flows from operating activities are provided by net income,
    adjusted for certain non-cash charges such as depreciation,
    amortization and stock-based compensation, as well as changes in
    the balance of certain assets and liabilities. Our cash flows
    from operating activities are significantly influenced by the
    payment terms set forth in our license agreements and by sales
    of our receivables.

We have entered into agreements whereby we may transfer accounts
    receivable to certain financing institutions on a non-recourse
    or limited-recourse basis. These transfers are recorded as sales
    and accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 140,
    “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishments of Liabilities.” During 2007, we
    transferred accounts receivable, net of the losses on the sale
    of the receivables, totaling $215.4 million, which
    approximated fair value, to financing institutions on a
    non-recourse basis, as compared to $180.6 million in 2006
    and $192.1 million in 2005. As a result of the credit
    losses recorded by banks in the second half of 2007, a number of
    banks have become less willing to purchase assets because of
    capital constraints and concerns about over-exposure to the
    technology sector, and we expect a reduced level of Proceeds
    from the sale of receivables in 2008.

Net cash provided by operating activities of $402.4 million
    for the year ended December 29, 2007 was primarily
    comprised of:

•

Net income, net of non-cash related expenses, of
    $533.0 million;

•

An increase in cash received for deferred revenue of
    $44.8 million; and

•

An increase in Accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of
    $20.4 million, primarily due to accrued severance and legal
    settlement costs, net of non-cash investing activities of
    $12.5 million for the purchase of acquired intangibles;
    partially offset by

•

An increase in Receivables, net and Installment contract
    receivables of $162.5 million, net of sales of receivables,
    due to the payment terms set forth in our license
    agreements; and

•

A decrease in Other long-term liabilities for the income tax
    benefit of a settlement with the IRS of $27.8 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities of $421.2 million
    for the year ended December 30, 2006 was primarily
    comprised of:

•

Net income, net of non-cash related expenses, of
    $427.1 million;

•

An increase in cash received for deferred revenue of
    $24.4 million; and

•

A decrease in Receivables, net and Installment contract
    receivables of $11.6 million, net of sales of receivables,
    due to the payment terms set forth in our license agreements;
    partially offset by

•

A decrease in Accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of
    $51.5 million, primarily due to payments of income taxes.

Net cash provided by operating activities of $426.3 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily
    comprised of:

•

Net income, net of non-cash related expenses, of
    $283.6 million; and

•

A decrease in Receivables, net and Installment contract
    receivables of $91.4 million, net of sales of receivables,
    due to the payment terms set forth in our license
    agreements; and

•

An increase in cash received for deferred revenue of
    $32.6 million.

Cash
    flows from investing activities

Our primary investing activities consisted of:

•

Purchases and proceeds from the sale of property, plant and
    equipment;

•

Acquisitions of businesses, assets and intangibles; and

•

Proceeds from the sale of long-term investments.

In January 2006, KhiMetrics, Inc., a cost method investment held
    by Telos Venture Partners, a limited partnership in which we and
    our 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment Plan Trust are
    the sole limited partners, was sold for consideration of $6.53
    per share of common stock. In connection with this sale, we
    received



approximately $20.2 million in cash and recorded a gain of
    approximately $17.5 million during the year ended
    December 30, 2006. In addition, our 1996 Deferred
    Compensation Venture Investment Plan Trust received
    $2.9 million in cash and recorded a gain of
    $2.5 million during the year ended December 30, 2006.
    Under the purchase agreement, an additional 10% of the
    consideration was held in escrow, which was released to us and
    to the trust in January 2007. Upon receipt of these additional
    proceeds, we recorded a gain of $2.6 million and our 1996
    Deferred Compensation Venture Investment Plan Trust recorded a
    gain of $0.4 million in the year ended December 29,
    2007.

    compared to 2006

Net cash used for investing activities decreased by
    $3.3 million in 2007, as compared to 2006. The decrease was
    primarily due to:

•

An increase of $46.2 million in Proceeds from the sale of
    property, plant and equipment; partially offset by

•

A decrease of $19.7 million in Proceeds from the sale of
    Long-term investments;

•

An increase of $14.9 million in cash paid in business
    combinations and asset acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and
    acquisition of intangibles; and

•

An increase of $14.2 million in Purchases of property,
    plant and equipment, including payments associated with our
    construction of a new building on our San Jose campus.

In January 2007, we completed the sale of certain land and
    buildings in San Jose, California for a sales price of
    $46.5 million in cash. Concurrently with the sale, we
    leased back from the purchaser all available space in the
    buildings. During the lease term, we are constructing an
    additional building located on our San Jose, California
    campus to replace the buildings we sold in this transaction. We
    used $21.0 million in cash during 2007 for construction of
    this new building.

We expect to continue our investing activities, including
    purchasing property, plant and equipment, purchasing intangible
    assets, purchasing software licenses and making long-term equity
    investments.

    compared to 2005

Net cash used for investing activities decreased by
    $110.9 million in 2006, as compared to 2005. The decrease
    was primarily due to:

•

A decrease of $180.8 million in Purchases of short-term
    investments; and

•

A decrease of $231.4 million in Cash paid in business
    combinations, net of cash acquired and acquisition of
    intangibles; partially offset by

•

A decrease of $289.2 million in Proceeds from the sale of
    short-term investments; and

•

A decrease of $33.3 million in Proceeds from the sale of
    property, plant and equipment.

Cash
    flows from financing activities

Financing cash flows during 2007 consisted primarily of the
    issuance of common stock under certain employee plans and
    purchases of treasury stock.

    compared to 2006

Net cash used for financing activities was $170.1 million
    in 2007, as compared to net cash provided by financing
    activities of $233.9 million in 2006. The change was
    primarily due to:

•

A net decrease of $224.8 million in cash received upon
    issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes, net of cash paid to
    retire a portion of the 2023 Notes and the hedge and warrant
    transactions described below; partially offset by

•

An increase of $98.8 million in Proceeds from the issuance
    of common stock due to an increased number of stock options
    exercised during 2007;

•

A decrease of $104.0 million in Principal payments on the
    Term Loan; and

•

A decrease of $75.5 million in Purchases of treasury stock.



2006 compared
    to 2005

Net cash used for financing activities was $233.9 million
    in 2006, as compared to net cash provided by financing
    activities of $205.3 million in 2005. The change was
    primarily due to:

•

A net increase of $224.8 million in cash received upon
    issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes, net of cash paid to
    retire a portion of the 2023 Notes and the hedge and warrant
    transactions described below; partially offset by

•

An increase of $131.9 million in Principal payments on the
    Term Loan; and

•

An increase of $393.0 million in Purchases of treasury
    stock.

Other
    Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources

Income
    Taxes

We provide for United States income taxes on the earnings of our
    foreign subsidiaries unless the earnings are considered
    indefinitely invested outside of the United States. As of
    December 29, 2007, the cumulative amount of earnings upon
    which United States income taxes have not been provided was
    approximately $424.2 million. As of December 29, 2007,
    the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings was
    approximately $139.8 million. As of December 29, 2007,
    we intend to indefinitely reinvest our undistributed foreign
    earnings outside of the United States.

We adopted the provisions of FIN No. 48 on
    December 31, 2006, which was the first day of our 2007
    fiscal year. We recognized a $59.4 million decrease in the
    net liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which was
    accounted for as an increase to the December 31, 2006
    balance of retained earnings. We also recognized a
    $42.6 million decrease in the net liabilities for
    unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as a
    $35.3 million increase in the December 31, 2006
    balance of Common stock and capital in excess of par value and a
    $7.3 million decrease in the December 31, 2006 balance
    of Goodwill.

Upon adoption of FIN No. 48, we also recognized
    additional long-term income tax assets of $115.0 million
    and additional long-term income tax liabilities of
    $115.0 million to present the unrecognized tax benefits as
    gross amounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We also
    decreased current income tax liabilities by $26.2 million
    and increased long-term income tax liabilities by the same
    amount based on our anticipation of the amount of cash payments
    to be made within one year.

As of December 29, 2007, we had current income tax
    liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of
    $7.0 million. As of December 29, 2007, we had
    long-term income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax
    benefits of $259.8 million. For additional information on
    the income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits,
    see the discussion under the heading “Contractual
    Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements” below.

The IRS and other tax authorities regularly examine our income
    tax returns. In November 2003, the IRS completed its field
    examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years
    1997 through 1999 and issued a Revenue Agent’s Report, or
    RAR, in which the IRS proposed to assess an aggregate tax
    deficiency for the three-year period of approximately
    $143.0 million. The most significant of the disputed
    adjustments for the tax years 1997 through 1999 related to
    transfer pricing arrangements that we had with a foreign
    subsidiary. In December 2007, the Joint Committee on Taxation of
    the U.S. Congress, or the Joint Committee, approved and the
    Appeals Office executed settlement agreements resulting in an
    effective settlement of the transfer pricing dispute for
    purposes of FIN No. 48. We expect to receive a refund
    of tax and interest of approximately $3.7 million during
    the first half of 2008.

In July 2006, the IRS completed its field examination of our
    federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002
    and in November 2006, the IRS issued an amended RAR in which the
    IRS proposed to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the
    three-year period of approximately $318.0 million. For an
    additional description of the IRS tax examinations, see the
    discussion under the heading “Results of
    Operations – Income Taxes” above.

We believe that the proposed IRS adjustments are inconsistent
    with applicable tax laws and we are vigorously challenging these
    proposed adjustments. The RAR is not a final Statutory Notice of
    Deficiency but the IRS imposes interest on the proposed
    deficiencies until the matters are resolved. Interest is
    compounded daily at rates published by the IRS, which rates are
    adjusted quarterly and have been between 4% and 10% since 2001.



1.375% Convertible
    Senior Notes Due 2011 and 1.500% Convertible Senior Notes
    Due 2013

In December 2006, we issued $250.0 million principal amount
    of 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2011, or the 2011
    Notes, and $250.0 million of 1.500% Convertible Senior
    Notes Due 2013, or the 2013 Notes, and collectively, the
    Convertible Senior Notes, to three initial purchasers in a
    private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the
    Securities Act for resale to qualified institutional buyers
    pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. We received net proceeds of
    approximately $487.0 million after transaction fees of
    approximately $13.0 million, including $12.0 million
    of underwriting discounts. A portion of the net proceeds
    totaling $228.5 million was used to purchase
    $189.6 million principal amount of our Zero Coupon Zero
    Yield Senior Convertible Notes Due 2023, or the 2023 Notes.

Holders may convert their Convertible Senior Notes prior to
    maturity upon the occurrence of one of the following events:

•

The price of our common stock reaches $27.50 during certain
    periods of time specified in the Convertible Senior Notes;

•

Specified corporate transactions occur; or

•

The trading price of the Convertible Senior Notes falls below a
    certain threshold.

On and after November 2, 2011, in the case of the 2011
    Notes, and November 1, 2013, in the case of 2013 Notes,
    until the close of business on the scheduled trading day
    immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert
    their Convertible Senior Notes at any time, regardless of the
    foregoing circumstances. We may not redeem the Convertible
    Senior Notes prior to maturity.

The initial conversion rate for the Convertible Senior Notes is
    47.2813 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal
    amount of Convertible Senior Notes, equivalent to a conversion
    price of approximately $21.15 per share of our common stock.
    Upon conversion, a holder will receive the sum of the daily
    settlement amounts, calculated on a proportionate basis for each
    day, during a specified observation period following the
    conversion date. The daily settlement amount during each date of
    the observation period consists of:

•

Cash up to the principal amount of the note; and

•

Our common stock to the extent that the conversion value exceeds
    the amount of cash paid upon conversion of the Convertible
    Senior Notes.

In addition, if a fundamental change occurs prior to maturity,
    we will, in certain cases, increase the conversion rate by an
    additional amount up to $8.27 per share, for a holder that
    elects to convert its Convertible Senior Notes in connection
    with such fundamental change, which amount will be paid entirely
    in cash. A fundamental change is any transaction or event
    (whether by means of an exchange offer, liquidation, tender
    offer, consolidation, merger, combination, reclassification,
    recapitalization or otherwise) in connection with which more
    than 50% of our common stock is exchanged for, converted into,
    acquired for or constitutes solely the right to receive,
    consideration which is not at least 90% shares of common stock,
    or depositary receipts representing such shares, that are:

•

Listed on, or immediately after the transaction or event will be
    listed on, a United States national securities exchange; or

•

Approved, or immediately after the transaction or event will be
    approved, for quotation on a United States system of automated
    dissemination of quotations of securities prices similar to the
    NASDAQ National Market prior to its designation as a national
    securities exchange.

As of December 29, 2007, none of the conditions allowing
    the holders of the Convertible Senior Notes to convert had been
    met.

Interest on the Convertible Senior Notes began accruing in
    December 2006 and is payable semi-annually each
    December 15th and June 15th.

Concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes,
    we entered into hedge transactions with various parties whereby
    we have the option to purchase up to 23.6 million shares of
    our common stock at a price of $21.15 per share, subject to
    adjustment. These options expire on December 15, 2011, in
    the case of the 2011 Notes, and December 15, 2013, in the
    case of the 2013 Notes, and must be settled in net shares. The
    aggregate cost of these hedge transactions was
    $119.8 million and has been recorded as a reduction to
    Stockholders’ equity in accordance with EITF

No. 00-19,

“Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed
    to, and Potentially Settled in, a



Company’s Own Stock.” The estimated fair value of the
    hedges acquired in connection with the issuance of the
    Convertible Senior Notes was $98.1 million as of
    December 29, 2007. Subsequent changes in the fair value of
    these hedges will not be recognized as long as the instruments
    remain classified as equity.

In separate transactions, we also sold warrants to various
    parties for the purchase of up to 23.6 million shares of
    our common stock at a price of $31.50 per share in a private
    placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.
    The warrants expire on various dates from February 2012 through
    April 2012 in the case of the 2011 Notes, and February 2014
    through April 2014 in the case of the 2013 Notes, and must be
    settled in net shares. We received $39.4 million in cash
    proceeds from the sale of these warrants, which has been
    recorded as a reduction to Stockholders’ equity in
    accordance with EITF

No. 00-19.

The estimated fair value of the warrants sold in connection with
    the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes was
    $35.7 million as of December 29, 2007. Subsequent
    changes in the fair value of these warrants will not be
    recognized as long as the instruments remain classified as
    equity. The warrants will be included in diluted earnings per
    share, or EPS, to the extent the impact is not considered
    anti-dilutive.

Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes Due 2023

In August 2003, we issued $420.0 million principal amount
    of our 2023 Notes to two initial purchasers in a private
    placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act
    for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC
    Rule 144A. We received net proceeds of $406.4 million
    after transaction fees of $13.6 million that were recorded
    in Other long-term assets and are being amortized to interest
    expense using the straight-line method over five years, which is
    the duration of the first redemption period. The 2023 Notes were
    issued by us at par and bear no interest. The 2023 Notes are
    convertible into our common stock initially at a conversion
    price of $15.65 per share, which would result in an aggregate of
    26.8 million shares issued upon conversion, subject to
    adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. In
    connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes in
    December 2006, we repurchased $189.6 million principal
    amount of the 2023 Notes, reducing the aggregate number of
    shares to be issued upon conversion to 14.7 million.

We may redeem for cash all or any part of the 2023 Notes on or
    after August 15, 2008 for 100.00% of the principal amount.
    The holders of the 2023 Notes may require us to repurchase for
    cash all or any portion of their 2023 Notes on August 15,
    2008 for 100.25% of the principal amount, on August 15,
    2013 for 100.00% of the principal amount or on August 15,
    2018 for 100.00% of the principal amount, by providing to the
    paying agent a written repurchase notice. The repurchase notice
    must be delivered during the period commencing 30 business days
    prior to the relevant repurchase date and ending on the close of
    business on the business day prior to the relevant repurchase
    date. In addition, we may redeem for cash all or any part of the
    2023 Notes on or after August 15, 2008 for 100.00% of the
    principal amount, except for those 2023 Notes that holders have
    required us to repurchase on August 15, 2008 or on other
    repurchase dates, as described above. Because the 2023 Notes can
    be redeemed by the holders on August 15, 2008, the 2023
    Notes are classified as a Current liability in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet as of December 29, 2007.

Each $1,000 of principal of the 2023 Notes will initially be
    convertible into 63.8790 shares of our common stock,
    subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events.
    Holders of the 2023 Notes may convert their 2023 Notes prior to
    maturity only if:

•

The price of our common stock reaches $22.69 during certain
    periods of time specified in the 2023 Notes;

•

Specified corporate transactions occur;

•

The 2023 Notes have been called for redemption; or

•

The trading price of the 2023 Notes falls below a certain
    threshold.

In the event of a fundamental change in our corporate ownership
    or structure, the holders may require us to repurchase all or
    any portion of their 2023 Notes for 100.00% of the principal
    amount. Upon a fundamental change in our corporate ownership or
    structure, in certain circumstances we may choose to pay the
    repurchase price in cash, shares of our common stock or a
    combination of cash and shares of our common stock. As of
    December 29, 2007, none of the conditions allowing the
    holders of the 2023 Notes to convert had been met.

In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes
    in December 2006, a portion of the proceeds were used to
    purchase in the open market 2023 Notes with a principal balance
    of $189.6 million for a total purchase price of
    $228.5 million. In connection with this purchase, we
    incurred expenses of $40.8 million for the early



extinguishment of debt. The loss on early extinguishment of debt
    included the call premium on the purchased 2023 Notes and the
    write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred debt issuance
    costs.

Concurrently with the issuance of the 2023 Notes, we entered
    into hedge transactions with a financial institution whereby we
    originally acquired options to purchase up to 26.8 million
    shares of our common stock at a price of $15.65 per share. These
    options expire on August 15, 2008 and must be settled in
    net shares. The cost of the hedge transactions to us was
    $134.6 million. In connection with the purchase of a
    portion of the 2023 Notes in December 2006, we also sold
    12.1 million of the hedges that were originally purchased
    in connection with the 2023 Notes and received proceeds of
    $55.9 million.

In addition, we sold warrants for our common stock to a
    financial institution for the purchase of up to
    26.8 million shares of our common stock at a price of
    $23.08 per share. The warrants expire on various dates from
    February 2008 through May 2008 and must be settled in net
    shares. We received $56.4 million in cash proceeds from the
    sale of these warrants. In connection with the purchase of a
    portion of the 2023 Notes in December 2006, we also purchased
    12.1 million of the warrants for our common stock that were
    originally issued in connection with the 2023 Notes at a cost of
    $10.2 million. The remaining outstanding warrants will be
    included in diluted EPS to the extent the impact is not
    considered anti-dilutive.

As of December 29, 2007, the estimated fair value of the
    remaining hedges acquired in connection with the issuance of the
    2023 Notes was $39.0 million and the estimated fair value
    of the remaining warrants sold in connection with the issuance
    of the 2023 Notes was $0.2 million. Subsequent changes in
    the fair value of these hedge and warrant transactions will not
    be recognized as long as the instruments remain classified as
    equity.

The 2023 Notes are due in August 2023. However, the holders of
    the 2023 Notes can require us to repurchase for cash all or a
    portion of the 2023 Notes on August 15, 2008 for 100.25% of
    the principal amount. Therefore, we have included
    $230.4 million of principal of the 2023 Notes and
    $0.6 million of premium on the potential repurchase of the
    2023 Notes in the “Less Than 1 Year” column in
    the above table.

u

Included in other long-term contractual obligations are
    long-term income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax
    benefits of $259.8 million, and of that amount we estimate
    that $193.1 million will be paid within 1 to 3 years.
    We did not include the remaining long-term income tax
    liabilities of $66.7 million in the table above, because we
    estimated that this liability can be offset by available net
    operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and that future
    cash payments will not be required to settle this liability.
    However, the total amounts of income tax payable and the timing
    of such tax payments may depend upon the resolution of current
    and future tax examinations which cannot be estimated with



certainty. The remaining portion of other long-term contractual
    obligations is primarily acquisition-related liabilities.

With respect to purchase obligations that are cancelable by us,
    the table includes the amount that would have been payable if we
    had canceled the obligation as of December 29, 2007 or the
    earliest cancellation date.

In connection with our acquisitions completed prior to
    December 29, 2007, we may be obligated to pay up to an
    aggregate of $45.0 million in cash during the next
    53 months if certain predefined performance goals are
    achieved in full.

We expect that current cash and short-term investment balances
    and cash flows that are generated from operations will be
    sufficient to meet our working capital and other capital
    requirements for at least the next 12 months.

As of December 29, 2007, we did not have any significant
    off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in
    Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC

Regulation S-K.

New
    Accounting Standards

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R,
    “Business Combinations” and SFAS No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an amendment of Accounting Research
    Bulletin No. 51.” SFAS No. 141R will
    change how business acquisitions are accounted for and will
    impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in
    subsequent periods. SFAS No. 160 will change the
    accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will be
    recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a
    component of equity. SFAS No. 141R and
    SFAS No. 160 are effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2008. Early adoption is not permitted.
    We are currently evaluating the impact that
    SFAS No. 141R and SFAS No. 160 will have on
    our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities.” Under SFAS No. 159, companies may
    elect to measure certain financial instruments and certain other
    items at fair value. The standard requires that unrealized gains
    and losses on items for which the fair value option has been
    elected be reported in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2007. We are currently evaluating the impact that
    SFAS No. 159 will have on our consolidated financial
    statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements,” which defines fair value,
    establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands
    disclosures regarding fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value
    measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance
    found in various prior accounting pronouncements.
    SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2007. However, on February 12,
    2008, the FASB issued FSP

FAS No. 157-2,

which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for
    all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except
    those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
    financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually),
    to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 and
    interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the
    scope of FSP

FAS No. 157-2.

Effective for fiscal 2008, we will adopt SFAS No. 157
    except as it applies to those non-financial assets and
    non-financial liabilities as described in FSP

FAS No. 157-2.

We are currently evaluating the impact that
    SFAS No. 157 will have on our consolidated financial
    statements.

Item 7A. Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest
    Rate Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
    relates primarily to our portfolio of Cash and cash equivalents.
    While we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of
    the world’s leading industrialized countries, our interest
    income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the
    general level of United States interest rates. In this regard,
    changes in United States interest rates affect the interest
    earned on our Cash and cash equivalents and costs associated
    with foreign currency hedges.

We invest in high quality credit issuers and, by policy, limit
    the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer. As part of
    our policy, our first priority is to reduce the risk of
    principal loss. Consequently, we seek to preserve our invested
    funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment
    risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality
    credit securities that we believe to have low credit risk and by
    positioning our portfolio to respond



appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of
    any investment issuer or guarantor. The short-term
    interest-bearing portfolio of Cash and cash equivalents includes
    only marketable securities with active secondary or resale
    markets to ensure portfolio liquidity.

All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or
    less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash
    equivalents. Investments with maturities greater than three
    months are classified as available-for-sale and are considered
    to be short-term investments. The carrying value of our
    interest-bearing instruments approximated fair value as of
    December 29, 2007. The following table presents the
    carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for
    our interest-bearing instruments, which are all classified as
    Cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as
    of December 29, 2007.

Foreign
    Currency Risk

Most of our revenue, expenses and material business activity are
    transacted in the United States dollar. However, certain of our
    operations include transactions in foreign currencies and,
    therefore, we benefit from a weaker dollar, and in certain
    countries where we invoice customers in the local currency, we
    are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major
    currencies worldwide. The primary effect of foreign currency
    transactions on our results of operations from a weakening
    United States dollar is an increase in revenue offset by a
    smaller increase in expenses. Conversely, the primary effect of
    foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from
    a strengthening United States dollar is a reduction in revenue
    offset by a smaller reduction in expenses.

We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with
    financial institutions to protect against currency exchange
    risks associated with existing assets and liabilities. A foreign
    currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing
    in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying
    liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange
    rates. Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract
    decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or
    underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in
    foreign exchange rates. These forward contracts are not
    designated as accounting hedges under SFAS No. 133,
    “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities,” and, therefore, the unrealized gains and
    losses are recognized in Other income, net, in advance of the
    actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these
    forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other
    current assets.

Our policy governing hedges of foreign currency risk does not
    allow us to use forward contracts for trading purposes. Our
    forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or
    less. The effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our
    ability to estimate future asset and liability exposures. We
    enter into currency forward exchange contracts based on
    estimated future asset and liability exposures. Recognized gains
    and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will
    ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the
    amount of currency forward exchange contracts with actual
    underlying asset and liability exposures.

The following table provides information, as of
    December 29, 2007, about our forward foreign currency
    contracts. The information is provided in United States dollar
    equivalent amounts. The table presents the notional amounts, at
    contract exchange rates, and the weighted average contractual
    foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the
    foreign currency per United States dollar, which in some cases
    may not be the market



convention for quoting a particular currency. All of these
    forward contracts matured prior to or during February 2008.

While we actively monitor our foreign currency risks, there can

    will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency
    exchange rates on our results of operations, cash flows and
    financial position.

Equity

1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2011 and
    1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2013

In December 2006, we issued $250.0 million principal amount
    of 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2011, or the 2011
    Notes, and $250.0 million of 1.500% Convertible Senior
    Notes Due 2013, or the 2013 Notes and collectively, the
    Convertible Senior Notes, to three initial purchasers in a
    private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the
    Securities Act for resale to qualified institutional buyers
    pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. Concurrently with the issuance
    of the Convertible Senior Notes, we entered into hedge
    transactions with various parties and in separate transactions,
    sold warrants to various parties to reduce the potential
    dilution from the conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes and
    to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the
    price of our common stock. For an additional description of the
    Convertible Senior Notes, including the hedge and warrants
    transactions, see the discussion under the heading
    “Item 7 – Liquidity and Capital
    Resources – Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital
    Resources” above.

Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes Due 2023

In August 2003, we issued $420.0 million principal amount
    of our 2023 Notes to two initial purchasers in a private
    placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act
    for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC
    Rule 144A. Concurrently with the issuance of the 2023
    Notes, we entered into hedge transactions with one of the
    initial purchasers and in a separate transaction, sold warrants
    to one of the initial purchasers to reduce the potential
    dilution from the conversion of the 2023 Notes and to mitigate
    any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our
    common stock. For an additional description of the 2023 Notes,
    including the hedge and warrants transactions, see the
    discussion under the heading “Item 7 –
    Liquidity and Capital Resources – Factors Affecting
    Liquidity and Capital Resources” above.

Investments

We have a portfolio of equity investments that includes
    marketable equity securities and non-marketable equity
    securities. Our equity investments are made primarily in
    connection with our strategic investment program. Under our
    strategic investment program, from time to time we make cash
    investments in companies with technologies that are potentially
    strategically important to us.



The fair value of our portfolio of available-for-sale marketable
    equity securities, which are included in Short-term investments
    on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, was
    $14.9 million as of December 29, 2007 and
    $23.7 million as of December 30, 2006. While we
    actively monitor these investments, we do not currently engage
    in any hedging activities to reduce or eliminate equity price
    risk with respect to these equity investments. Accordingly, we
    could lose all or part of our investment portfolio of marketable
    equity securities if there is an adverse change in the market
    prices of the companies we invest in.

Our investments in non-marketable equity securities would be
    negatively affected by an adverse change in equity market
    prices, although the impact cannot be directly quantified. Such
    a change, or any negative change in the financial performance or
    prospects of the companies whose non-marketable securities we
    own, would harm the ability of these companies to raise
    additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to
    realize any gains or return of our investments through liquidity
    events such as initial public offerings, acquisitions and
    private sales. These types of investments involve a high degree
    of risk, and there can be no assurance that any company we
    invest in will grow or will be successful or that we will be
    able to liquidate a particular investment when desired.
    Accordingly, we could lose all or part of our investment.

Our investments in non-marketable equity securities had a
    carrying amount of $26.2 million as of December 29,
    2007 and $31.4 million as of December 30, 2006. If we
    determine that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value
    exists for a non-marketable equity security, we write down the
    investment to its fair value and record the related write-down
    as an investment loss in our Consolidated Income Statements.

We recorded a Loss on extinguishment of debt of
    $40.8 million during the quarter ended December 30,
    2006, which includes a premium paid to repurchase a portion of
    the 2023 Notes of $38.9 million and a write-off of the
    related portion of unamortized deferred costs of issuing the
    2023 Notes of $1.9 million.

Item 9. Changes
    in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and
    Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A. Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We carried out an evaluation required by

Rule 13a-15

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the
    Exchange Act, under the supervision and with the participation
    of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer, or
    CEO, and the Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act) as of December 29, 2007.



The evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures
    included a review of our processes and implementation and the
    effect on the information generated for use in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

In the course of this evaluation, we sought to identify any
    material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures,
    to determine whether we had identified any acts of fraud
    involving personnel who have a significant role in our
    disclosure controls and procedures, and to confirm that any
    necessary corrective action, including process improvements, was
    taken. This type of evaluation is done every fiscal quarter so
    that our conclusions concerning the effectiveness of these
    controls can be reported in our periodic reports filed with the
    SEC. The overall goals of these evaluation activities are to
    monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and to make
    modifications as necessary. We intend to maintain these
    disclosure controls and procedures, modifying them as
    circumstances warrant.

Based on their evaluation as of December 29, 2007, our CEO
    and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and
    procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that
    the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports
    filed or submitted under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
    specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) is
    accumulated and communicated to our management, including the
    CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure.

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
    reporting during the year ended December 29, 2007 that
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent
    Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that
    our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control
    over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and
    all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and
    operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
    that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
    design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
    resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be
    considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
    limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
    can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and
    instances of fraud, if any, within Cadence have been detected.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
    in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Exchange Act). Our management assessed the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 29, 2007. In making this assessment, our
    management used the criteria established in

Internal
    Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Our
    management has concluded that, as of December 29, 2007, our
    internal control over financial reporting is effective based on
    these criteria. Our independent registered public accounting
    firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an attestation report on our internal
    control over financial reporting, which is included herein.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Cadence Design Systems, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as
    of December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, and the
    related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’
    equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the
    years in the three-year period ended December 29, 2007. In
    connection with our audits of the consolidated financial
    statements, we also have audited the financial statement
    schedule, as set forth under Item 15(a)(2). These
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
    December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, and the
    results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
    years in the three-year period ended December 29, 2007, in
    conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement
    schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
    financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective December 31, 2006, the Company
    adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
    Interpretation (FIN) No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty
    in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB
    Statement No. 109

. Also, as discussed in note 2 to
    the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1,
    2006, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),

Share-Based
    Payment

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 29, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated
    February 25, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Cadence Design Systems, Inc.:

We have audited Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and
    subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 29, 2007, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control – Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)

.

The
    Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in the accompanying

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

included in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 29, 2007, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control –
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and
    subsidiaries as of December 29, 2007 and December 30,
    2006, and the related consolidated statements of income,
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash
    flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
    December 29, 2007. In connection with our audits of the
    consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the
    financial statement schedule as of and for each of the years in
    the three-year period ended December 29, 2007. Our report
    dated February 25, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    those consolidated financial statements and accompanying
    financial statement schedule.

CADENCE
    DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 29, 2007

NOTE 1.

CADENCE

Cadence Design Systems, Inc., or Cadence, licenses electronic
    design automation, or EDA, software, sells or leases hardware
    technology and intellectual property and provides design and
    methodology and education services throughout the world to help
    manage and accelerate electronic product development processes.
    Cadence’s broad range of products and services are used by
    electronics companies to design and develop complex integrated
    circuits, or ICs, and electronic systems.

NOTE 2.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles
    of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

Cadence’s fiscal year end is the Saturday closest to
    December 31. Fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 were 52-week years.
    Fiscal 2008 will be a 53-week year ending on January 3,
    2009. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
    of Cadence and its subsidiaries after elimination of
    intercompany accounts and transactions. All consolidated
    subsidiaries are wholly-owned by Cadence.

Use
    of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts
    of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates.

Cash,
    Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

Cadence considers all highly liquid debt instruments, which
    could include commercial paper, European Union euro time
    deposits, repurchase agreements and certificates of deposit,
    with remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of
    purchase to be cash equivalents. Investments with maturities
    greater than three months and less than one year are classified
    as short-term investments.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

Cadence transacts business in various foreign currencies. In
    general, the functional currency of a foreign operation is the
    local country’s currency except for Cadence’s
    principal Irish, Israeli, Hungarian and Dutch subsidiaries,
    whose functional currency is the United States dollar.
    Non-functional currency monetary balances are re-measured into
    the functional currency of the subsidiary with any related gain
    or loss recorded in Other income, net, in the accompanying
    Consolidated Income Statements. Assets and liabilities of
    operations outside the United States, for which the functional
    currency is the local currency, are translated into United
    States dollars using fiscal year-end exchange rates. Revenue and
    expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect
    during each fiscal month during the year. The effects of foreign
    currency translation adjustments are included in
    Stockholders’ Equity as a component of Accumulated other
    comprehensive income in the accompanying Consolidated Balance
    Sheets.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Cadence accounts for its foreign currency exchange contracts in
    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or
    SFAS, No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments
    and Hedging Activities.” Cadence enters into foreign
    currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions
    to protect against currency exchange risks associated with
    existing assets and liabilities. A foreign currency forward
    exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when
    underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities
    increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
    Conversely, a foreign currency forward exchange contract
    decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or
    underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in
    foreign exchange rates. The forward contracts are not designated
    as accounting hedges under SFAS No. 133 and,
    therefore, the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in
    Other income, net, in advance



of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of
    these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or
    other current assets.

Cadence does not use forward contracts for trading purposes.
    Cadence’s forward contracts generally have maturities of
    90 days or less. Recognized gains or losses with respect to
    our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how
    accurately Cadence is able to match the amount of currency
    forward exchange contracts with underlying asset and liability
    exposures.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

Cadence makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding
    receivables and provide allowances for the portion of
    receivables when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are
    made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding
    invoices and are recorded in operating expenses. For those
    invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are made based on
    Cadence’s historical bad debt experience. In determining
    these percentages, Cadence analyzes its historical collection
    experience and current economic trends. If the historical data
    Cadence uses to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful
    accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect
    outstanding receivables, additional provisions may be needed
    which could cause future results of operations to be materially
    affected.

Allowance
    for Sales Returns

Provisions for sales returns primarily relate to service
    arrangements and are recorded as a reduction to revenue. These
    provisions are made based on historical experience.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value.
    Cadence’s inventories include high technology parts and
    components for complex computer systems that emulate the
    performance and operation of computer IC and electronic systems.
    These parts and components may be specialized in nature or
    subject to rapid technological obsolescence. While Cadence has
    programs to minimize the required inventories on hand and
    considers technological obsolescence when estimating required
    reserves to reduce recorded amounts to market values, it is
    reasonably possible that such estimates could change in the near
    term. Cadence’s practice is to reserve for inventory in
    excess of

12-month

demand.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost.
    Depreciation and amortization are generally provided over the
    estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, as
    follows:

Computer equipment and related software

2-7 years

Buildings

10-32 years

Leasehold and building improvements

Shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life

Furniture and fixtures

3-5 years

Equipment

3-5 years

Cadence capitalizes the costs of software developed for internal
    use in compliance with Statement of Position, or SOP,

98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
    Obtained for Internal Use” and with Emerging Issues Task
    Force, or EITF,

No. 00-2,

“Accounting for Web Site Development Costs.”
    Capitalization of software developed for internal use and web
    site development costs begins at the application development
    phase of the project. Capitalization of software developed for
    internal use and web site development costs ends, and
    amortization begins, when the computer software is substantially
    complete and ready for its intended use. Amortization is
    recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life
    of the software. Cadence capitalized $24.1 million in 2007,
    $24.3 million in 2006 and $32.6 million in 2005 for
    costs of software developed for internal use.

Cadence recorded depreciation and amortization expense in the
    amount of $73.7 million in 2007, $72.0 million in 2006
    and $68.8 million in 2005 for property, plant and equipment.

In January 2007, Cadence completed the sale of certain land and
    buildings in San Jose, California for a sales price of
    $46.5 million in cash. Concurrently with the sale, Cadence
    leased back from the purchaser approximately



262,500 square feet of office space, which represents all
    available space in the buildings. The lease agreement includes
    an initial term of two years, with two options to extend the
    lease for six months each. Cadence is obligated to make lease
    payments related to this lease of $2.4 million in 2008 and
    $0.2 million in 2009. A substantial portion of the gain
    upon sale offset Cadence’s costs and expenses during the
    year ended December 29, 2007, and the remaining gain will
    be amortized over the remaining initial lease term.

Software
    Development Costs

Cadence accounts for software development costs in accordance
    with SFAS No. 86, “Accounting for the Costs of
    Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise
    Marketed.” Software development costs are capitalized
    beginning when a product’s technological feasibility has
    been established by completion of a working model of the product
    and amortization begins when a product is available for general
    release to customers. The period between the achievement of
    technological feasibility and the general release of
    Cadence’s products has typically been of short duration and
    costs incurred during this period have not been material.

Cadence did not capitalize any third party SFAS No. 86
    costs, or purchased software, during 2007. Cadence capitalized
    $7.3 million of purchased software during 2006 and
    $0.5 million of purchased software during 2005. Cadence has
    deemed the purchased software to have an alternative future use
    in accordance with SFAS No. 86. Therefore, Cadence
    begins amortization of purchased software when the technology is
    available for general release to customers. Amortization expense
    for purchased software was $5.1 million in 2007,
    $4.2 million in 2006 and $4.4 million in 2005.

Acquired
    Intangibles, including Goodwill

Acquired intangibles, which include purchased technology and
    other intangible assets, are stated at cost less accumulated
    amortization and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
    circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. In
    accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets,” goodwill and purchased intangibles with
    indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed for
    impairment at least annually or when events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that Cadence will not be able to recover
    the asset’s carrying amount. Acquired intangibles with
    definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
    remaining estimated economic life of the underlying products and
    technologies (original lives assigned are one to ten years).

During the third quarters of 2007, 2006 and 2005, Cadence
    completed its annual impairment analysis of goodwill. Based on
    the results of these impairment reviews, Cadence has determined
    that no indicators of impairment existed for its one reporting
    unit and, accordingly, no impairment charge was recognized
    during 2007, 2006 or 2005.

Long-lived
    Assets

Cadence’s long-lived assets consist of property, plant and
    equipment and other acquired intangibles, excluding goodwill.
    Cadence reviews its long-lived assets for impairment in
    accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” For assets to
    be held and used, Cadence initiates its review whenever events
    or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
    a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an
    asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the
    expected future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is
    expected to generate. If it is determined that an asset is not
    recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded in the amount by
    which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.
    During 2007 and 2006, there were no significant impairments of
    long-lived assets. During 2005, Cadence abandoned certain assets
    and recorded a charge of $2.4 million, which is included in
    Restructuring and other charges in the accompanying Consolidated
    Income Statements.

Marketable
    and Non-Marketable Securities

Marketable
    Securities

Management considers all of its investments in marketable
    securities as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities
    are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses
    presented net of tax and reported as a separate component of
    Stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses are
    determined using the specific identification method. Gains are
    recognized when realized and are recorded in the Consolidated
    Income Statements as Other



income, net. Losses are recognized as realized or when Cadence
    has determined that an other-than-temporary decline in fair
    value has occurred.

It is Cadence’s policy to review the fair value of these
    marketable securities on a regular basis to determine whether
    its investments in these companies are other-than-temporarily
    impaired. This evaluation includes, but is not limited to,
    reviewing each company’s cash position, financing needs,
    earnings or revenue outlook, operational performance, management
    or ownership changes and competition. If Cadence believes the
    carrying value of an investment is in excess of its fair value,
    and this difference is other-than-temporary, it is
    Cadence’s policy to write down the investment to reduce its
    carrying value to fair value.

Non-Marketable
    Securities

Cadence’s non-marketable securities include investments in
    privately-held companies and companies that are publicly-traded
    but as to which there are trading restrictions on the shares
    Cadence owns. To determine the fair value of publicly-traded
    securities with trading restrictions, Cadence considers the
    current market price of the security and the specific
    characteristics of the restrictions. To determine the fair value
    of privately-held investments, Cadence uses the most recent
    round of financing or estimates of current fair value using
    traditional valuation techniques. It is Cadence’s policy to
    review the fair value of these investments on a regular basis to
    determine whether the investments in these companies are
    other-than-temporarily impaired. This evaluation includes, but
    is not limited to, reviewing each company’s cash position,
    financing needs, earnings or revenue outlook, operational
    performance, management or ownership changes and competition. In
    the case of privately-held companies, this evaluation is based
    on information that Cadence requests from these companies. This
    information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as
    United States publicly-traded companies, and as such, the basis
    for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy
    of the data received from these companies. If Cadence believes
    the carrying value of an investment is in excess of fair value,
    and this difference is other-than-temporary, it is
    Cadence’s policy to write down the investment to fair value.

Equity
    Method Investments

Cadence applies the guidance in Accounting Principles Board
    Opinion, or APB, No. 18, “The Equity Method of
    Accounting for Investments in Common Stock,” as amended,
    and EITF

No. 02-14,

“Whether an Investor Should Apply the Equity Method of
    Accounting to Investments Other Than Common Stock,” to
    classify investments as equity method investments. These
    investments are held in the form of voting preferred stock or
    convertible debt of privately-held companies. If Cadence
    determines that it has the ability to exercise significant
    influence over the investee and the investment is in the form of
    in-substance common stock, the investment is accounted for under
    the equity method.

In applying the equity method of accounting, Cadence applies
    approach (a) of EITF

No. 99-10,

“Percentage Used to Determine the Amount of Equity Method
    Losses.” Accordingly, the portion of equity method income
    or loss recorded by Cadence is based on its percentage ownership
    of each investee’s preferred stock or convertible debt
    available to absorb losses or with contractual rights to income.
    Its level of participation in future financings of its equity
    method investees may impact Cadence’s proportional share in
    future income or losses. Cadence records its interest in equity
    method gains and losses in the quarter following incurrence
    because it is not practicable to obtain investee financial
    statements prior to the issuance of Cadence’s Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Cost
    Method Investments

Investments accounted for by Cadence under the cost method of
    accounting are carried at historical cost and Cadence
    periodically evaluates the fair value of each investment to
    determine if an other-than-temporary decline in value has
    occurred.

Nonqualified
    Deferred Compensation Trust

Executive Officers, senior management and Directors may elect to
    defer compensation payable to them under Cadence’s 1994
    Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan, or the NQDC. Deferred
    compensation payments are held in accounts with values indexed
    to the performance of selected mutual funds or money market
    accounts. In accordance with EITF

No. 97-14,

“Accounting for Deferred Compensation Arrangements Where
    Amounts Earned



Are Held in a Rabbi Trust and Invested,” Cadence
    consolidates the NQDC trust accounts in its Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

The selected mutual funds or money market accounts held in the
    NQDC trust are classified as trading securities in accordance
    with SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain
    Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.” Trading
    securities are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains
    and losses recognized in the Consolidated Income Statements as
    Other income, net. These trading securities are classified as
    Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets because the
    securities are not available for Cadence’s use in its
    operations.

Cadence’s obligation with respect to the NQDC trust is
    recorded in Other long-term liabilities on its Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. Increases and decreases in the NQDC liability
    are recorded as compensation expense in the Consolidated Income
    Statements.

Deferred
    Revenue

Deferred revenue arises when customers pay for products

and/or

services in advance of revenue recognition. Cadence’s
    deferred revenue consists primarily of unearned revenue on
    maintenance and product licenses for which revenue is recognized
    in installments over the duration of the license. Maintenance on
    perpetual licenses is generally renewed annually, billed in full
    in advance, and the corresponding revenue is recognized over the
    ensuing

12-month

maintenance term. The fees under product licenses for which
    revenue is not recognized immediately and for maintenance in
    connection with term and subscription licenses are generally
    billed quarterly in advance and the related revenue is
    recognized over multiple periods over the ensuing license period.

Comprehensive
    Income (Loss)

Other comprehensive income (loss) includes foreign currency
    translation gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses on
    marketable securities that are available-for-sale that have been
    excluded from Net income and reflected instead in
    Stockholders’ equity. Cadence has reported comprehensive
    income (loss) in its Consolidated Statements of
    Stockholders’ Equity. Cadence reclassified
    $4.4 million in 2007, net of $1.8 million of tax,
    $6.7 million in 2006, net of $2.7 million of tax,
    $9.2 million in 2005, net of $3.7 million of tax, from
    unrealized holding gains and losses on marketable securities to
    realized gains included in Other income, net, in the
    accompanying Consolidated Income Statements. The tax benefit for
    gross unrealized holding losses in marketable equity securities
    was $2.5 million in 2007, $4.4 million in 2006 and
    $1.2 million in 2005.

Revenue
    Recognition

Cadence applies the provisions of

SOP 97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by

SOP 98-9,

“Modification of

SOP 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain
    Transactions,” to all software licensing transactions and
    to all product revenue transactions where the software is not
    incidental. Cadence also applies the provisions of
    SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases,” to all
    hardware lease transactions. Cadence recognizes revenue when
    persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has
    been delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection of
    the resulting receivable is probable, and vendor-specific
    objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE, exists.

Cadence licenses software using three different license types:

•

Subscription licenses;

•

Term licenses; and

•

Perpetual licenses.

For many of Cadence’s term and subscription license
    arrangements, Cadence uses its proprietary internet-based
    delivery mechanism,

“eDA-on-tap,”

to facilitate the delivery of its software products. To maximize
    the efficiency of this delivery mechanism, Cadence created what
    it refers to as “eDA Cards,” of which there are two
    types. Subscription license customers may purchase what Cadence
    refers to as an “eDA Platinum Card,” which provides
    the customer access to and use of all software products
    delivered at the outset of the arrangement and the ability to
    use additional unspecified software products that may become
    commercially available during the term of the arrangement. Term
    license customers may purchase what Cadence refers to as an
    “eDA Gold Card,” which provides the customer access to
    and use of all software products delivered at the outset of the
    arrangement. Overall,



the eDA Cards provide greater flexibility for Cadence’s
    customers in how and when they deploy and use Cadence’s
    software products.

Subscription licenses

– Cadence’s
    subscription license arrangements offer customers the right to:

•

Access and use all software products delivered at the outset of
    an arrangement throughout the entire term of the arrangement,
    generally two to four years, with no rights to return;

•

Use unspecified additional software products that become
    commercially available during the term of the
    arrangement; and

•

Remix among the software products delivered at the outset of the
    arrangement, as well as the right to remix into other
    unspecified additional software products that may become
    available during the term of the arrangement, so long as the
    cumulative value of all products in use does not exceed the
    total license fee determined at the outset of the arrangement.
    These remix rights may be exercisable multiple times during the
    term of the arrangement. The right to remix all software
    products delivered pursuant to the license agreement is not
    considered an exchange or return of software because all
    software products have been delivered and the customer has the
    continuing right to use them.

Customers that purchase an eDA Platinum Card have the ability
    during the term of the arrangement to use software products
    delivered at the outset of the arrangement, and to use other
    unspecified additional software products that may become
    commercially available during the term of the arrangement, until
    the fees have been depleted.

In general, revenue associated with subscription licenses is
    recognized ratably over the term of the license commencing upon
    the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery
    of the software product. Subscription license revenue is
    allocated to product and maintenance revenue. The allocation to
    maintenance revenue is based on vendor specific objective
    evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of the undelivered maintenance
    that was established in connection with the sale of our term
    licenses.

In the event that a subscription license arrangement is
    terminated by mutual agreement and a new term license
    arrangement is entered into either concurrently with or
    subsequent to the termination of the subscription license
    arrangement, the revenue associated with the new term license
    arrangement is recognized upon the later of the effective date
    of the arrangement or delivery of the software product, assuming
    all other criteria in

SOP 97-2

have been met.

Term licenses

– Cadence’s term license
    arrangements offer customers the right to:

•

Access and use all software products delivered at the outset of
    an arrangement throughout the entire term of the arrangement,
    generally two to four years, with no rights to return; and

•

Remix among the software products delivered at the outset of the
    arrangement, so long as the cumulative value of all products in
    use does not exceed the total license fee determined at the
    outset of the arrangement. These remix rights may be exercisable
    multiple times during the term of the arrangement. The right to
    remix all software products delivered pursuant to the license
    agreement is not considered an exchange or return of software
    because all software products have been delivered and the
    customer has the continuing right to use them.

Customers that purchase an eDA Gold Card have the ability during
    the term of the arrangement to use software products delivered
    at the outset of the arrangement until the fees relating to the
    arrangement have been depleted.

In general, revenue associated with term licenses is recognized
    upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or
    delivery of the software product.

Perpetual licenses

– Cadence’s perpetual
    licenses consist of software licensed on a perpetual basis with
    no right to return or exchange the licensed software. In
    general, revenue associated with perpetual licenses is
    recognized upon the later of the effective date of the license
    or delivery of the licensed product.

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement

–
    Generally, Cadence uses a contract signed by the customer as
    evidence of an arrangement for subscription and term licenses
    and hardware leases. If a contract signed by the customer does
    not exist, Cadence has historically used a purchase order as
    evidence of an arrangement for perpetual licenses, hardware
    sales, maintenance renewals and small fixed-price service
    projects, such as training classes and small methodology service
    engagements of approximately $10,000 or less. For all other
    service engagements,



Cadence uses a signed professional services agreement and a
    statement of work to evidence an arrangement. In cases where
    both a signed contract and a purchase order exist, Cadence
    considers the signed contract to be the most persuasive evidence
    of the arrangement. Sales through Cadence’s distributors
    are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship,
    together with binding purchase orders from the distributor on a

transaction-by-transaction

basis.

Product delivery

– Software and the
    corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers
    electronically. Electronic delivery occurs when Cadence provides
    the customer access to the software. Occasionally, Cadence will
    deliver the software on a compact disc with standard transfer
    terms of

free-on-board,

or F.O.B., shipping point. Cadence’s software license
    agreements generally do not contain conditions for acceptance.
    With respect to hardware, delivery of an entire system is deemed
    to occur upon its successful installation. For certain hardware
    products, installation is the responsibility of the customer, as
    the system is fully functional at the time of shipment. For
    these products, delivery is deemed to be complete when the
    products are shipped with freight terms of F.O.B. shipping point.

For customers who purchase eDA Gold or eDA Platinum Cards,
    delivery occurs when the customer has been provided with access
    codes that allow the customer to download the software pursuant
    to the terms of the software license agreement.

Fee is fixed or determinable

– Cadence assesses
    whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the
    arrangement, primarily based on the payment terms associated
    with the transaction. Cadence has established a history of
    collecting under the original contract without providing
    concessions on payments, products or services. For installment
    contracts that do not include a substantial up front payment,
    Cadence only considers that a fee is fixed or determinable if
    the arrangement has payment periods that are equal to or less
    than the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in
    equal or nearly equal installments, when evaluated over the
    entire term of the arrangement. Cadence has a history of
    collecting receivables under installment contracts of up to five
    years.

Significant judgment is involved in assessing whether a fee is
    fixed or determinable. Cadence must also make these judgments
    when assessing whether a contract amendment to a term
    arrangement (primarily in the context of a license extension or
    renewal) constitutes a concession. Cadence’s experience has
    been that it is able to determine whether a fee is fixed or
    determinable for term licenses. While Cadence does not expect
    that experience to change, if Cadence no longer were to have a
    history of collecting under the original contract without
    providing concessions on term licenses, revenue from term
    licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under
    the installment contract become due and payable. Such a change
    could have a material impact on Cadence’s results of
    operations.

Collection is probable

– Cadence assesses the
    probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of
    the arrangement based on a number of factors, including the
    customer’s payment history and its current
    creditworthiness. Cadence has concluded that collection is not
    probable for license arrangements executed with customers in
    certain countries. If in Cadence’s judgment collection of a
    fee is not probable, Cadence defers the revenue until the
    uncertainty is removed, which generally means revenue is
    recognized upon receipt of cash payment. Cadence’s
    experience has been that it is able to estimate whether
    collection is probable. While Cadence does not expect that
    experience to change, if Cadence were to determine that
    collection is not probable for any license arrangement,
    particularly those with installment payment terms, revenue from
    such license would be recognized generally upon receipt of cash
    payment. Such a change could have a material impact on
    Cadence’s results of operations.

Vendor-specific objective evidence of fair
    value

– Cadence’s VSOE for certain product
    elements of an arrangement is based upon the pricing in
    comparable transactions when the element is sold separately.
    VSOE for maintenance is generally based upon the customer’s
    stated annual renewal rates. VSOE for services is generally
    based on the price charged when the services are sold
    separately. For multiple element arrangements, VSOE must exist
    to allocate the total fee among all delivered and undelivered
    elements of a term or perpetual license arrangement. If VSOE
    does not exist for all elements to support the allocation of the
    total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of the
    arrangement, revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist
    for the undelivered elements, or until all elements are
    delivered, whichever is earlier. If VSOE of all undelivered
    elements exists but VSOE does not exist for one or more
    delivered elements, revenue is recognized using the residual
    method. Under the residual method, the VSOE of the undelivered
    elements is deferred, and the remaining portion of the



arrangement fee is recognized as revenue as the elements are
    delivered. Cadence’s experience has been that it is able to
    determine VSOE for maintenance and time-based services, but not
    for product.

Finance fee revenue

– Finance fees result from
    discounting to present value the product revenue derived from
    installment contracts in which the payment terms extend beyond
    one year from the effective date of the contract. Finance fees
    are recognized using a method that approximates the effective
    interest method over the relevant license term and are
    classified as product revenue. Finance fee revenue represented
    approximately 2% of total revenue for each of the years ended
    December 29, 2007, December 30, 2006 and
    December 31, 2005. Upon the sale of an installment
    contract, Cadence recognizes the remaining finance fee revenue
    associated with the installment contract.

Services revenue

– Services revenue consists
    primarily of revenue received for performing design and
    methodology services. These services are not related to the
    functionality of the products licensed. Revenue from service
    contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method,
    as work is performed, or on the percentage-of-completion method.
    For contracts with fixed or not-to-exceed fees, Cadence
    estimates on a monthly basis the percentage-of-completion, which
    is based on the completion of milestones relating to the
    arrangement. Cadence has a history of accurately estimating
    project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A
    number of internal and external factors can affect these
    estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency
    variances and specification and testing requirement changes. If
    different conditions were to prevail such that accurate
    estimates could not be made, then the use of the completed
    contract method would be required and the recognition of all
    revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was
    completed. Such a change could have a material impact on
    Cadence’s results of operations.

In accordance with EITF

No. 06-03,

“How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to
    Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income
    Statement (That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation),”
    Cadence applies the net basis presentation for taxes collected
    from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.

Accounting
    for Income Taxes

Cadence provides for the effect of income taxes in its
    Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”
    and Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB,
    Interpretation, or FIN, No. 48, “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes – An Interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109.” Cadence must make significant
    judgments to apply the principles of SFAS No. 109 and
    FIN No. 48.

In accordance with SFAS No. 109, Cadence is required
    to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in
    which it operates. This process involves estimating actual
    current tax liabilities together with assessing temporary
    differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as
    deferred revenue, for tax and accounting purposes. These
    differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which
    are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
    taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
    are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
    tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
    recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
    date.

Cadence then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets
    will be recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent
    it believes that recovery is not likely, Cadence must establish
    a valuation allowance. To the extent Cadence establishes a
    valuation allowance for deferred tax assets or increases this
    allowance, Cadence may need to include an expense within the tax
    provision of its Consolidated Income Statement. The valuation
    allowance is based on estimates of taxable income for each
    jurisdiction in which Cadence operates for the period over which
    deferred tax assets will be recoverable. In the event that
    actual results differ from these estimates or Cadence adjusts
    these estimates in future periods, Cadence may need to establish
    an additional valuation allowance, which could materially affect
    its consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Cadence adopted FIN No. 48 on December 31, 2006, which
    was the first day of Cadence’s 2007 fiscal year.
    FIN No. 48 requires Cadence to take a two-step
    approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions.
    The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition
    by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates
    that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
    sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals
    or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax
    benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of
    being realized upon effective settlement. Cadence re-evaluates
    its income tax positions on a quarterly



basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or
    circumstances, changes in or interpretations of tax law,
    effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity.
    Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in
    recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax
    provision. Upon adoption of FIN No. 48, Cadence
    adopted an accounting policy to classify interest and penalties
    on unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. For years
    prior to the adoption of FIN No. 48, Cadence also
    reported interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits as
    income tax expense.

Restructuring
    Charges

Cadence accounts for restructuring charges in accordance with
    SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100,
    “Restructuring and Impairment Charges,” as amended.
    From fiscal 2001 through fiscal 2005, Cadence undertook
    significant restructuring initiatives. The individual components
    of the restructuring activities initiated prior to fiscal 2003
    were accounted for in accordance with EITF

No. 94-3,

“Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination
    Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain
    Costs Incurred in a Restructuring),” and EITF

No. 88-10,

“Costs Associated with Lease Modifications or
    Terminations.”

For restructuring activities initiated after fiscal 2002,
    Cadence accounted for the leased facilities in accordance with
    SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated
    with Exit or Disposal Activities.” For all periods
    presented, Cadence accounted for the asset-related portions of
    these restructurings in accordance with SFAS No. 144,
    “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets.” In addition, for all periods presented, the
    severance and benefits charges were accounted for in accordance
    with SFAS No. 112, “Employers’ Accounting
    for Postemployment Benefits – An Amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 5 and 43.”

In connection with these restructuring initiatives, Cadence has
    made a number of estimates and assumptions related to losses on
    excess facilities vacated or consolidated, particularly the
    timing of subleases and sublease terms. Closure and space
    reduction costs included in the restructuring charges include
    payments required under leases less any applicable estimated
    sublease income after the facilities are abandoned, lease buyout
    costs and certain contractual costs to maintain facilities
    during the period after abandonment.

In addition, Cadence has recorded estimated provisions for
    termination benefits and outplacement costs, long-term asset
    impairments, and other restructuring costs. Cadence regularly
    evaluates the adequacy of its restructuring accrual, and adjusts
    the balance based on changes in estimates and assumptions.
    Cadence may incur future charges for new restructuring
    activities as well as for changes in estimates to amounts
    previously recorded.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Cadence adopted SFAS No. 123R “Share-Based
    Payment,” on January 1, 2006 using the modified
    prospective transition method. SFAS No. 123R requires
    companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in
    exchange for awards of equity instruments based upon the fair
    value of those awards on the grant date. Using the modified
    prospective transition method of adopting
    SFAS No. 123R, Cadence began recognizing compensation
    expense for equity-based awards granted on or after
    January 1, 2006 and unvested awards granted prior to
    January 1, 2006. Prior period stock-based compensation
    expense was recognized under APB No. 25 “Accounting
    for Stock Issued to Employees.”

Under SFAS No. 123R, stock-based compensation expense
    is measured at the grant date based on the value of the option
    or restricted stock and is recognized as expense, less expected
    forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is
    generally the vesting period. The fair value of each option
    grant and each purchase right granted under Cadence’s
    Employee Stock Purchase Program, or ESPP, is estimated on the
    date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
    fair value of each restricted stock issuance is determined using
    the fair value of Cadence’s common stock on the grant date.
    Cadence recognizes stock-based compensation expense on the
    straight-line method for options and restricted stock that only
    contain a service condition and on the graded-vesting method for
    options and restricted stock that contain both a service and
    performance condition. Determining the fair value of stock-based
    awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating
    the following:

•

Expected volatility of our stock;

•

Expected term of stock options;

•

Risk-free interest rate for the period;

•

Expected dividends, if any; and



•

Expected forfeitures.

The computation of the expected volatility assumption used in
    the Black-Scholes pricing model for option grants is based on
    implied volatility calculated using the volatility of publicly
    traded options for Cadence common stock. Cadence uses this
    approach to determine volatility because:

•

Options for Cadence’s common stock are actively traded;

•

The market prices of both the traded options and underlying
    shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and
    on a date reasonably close to the grant date of the employee
    stock options;

•

The traded options have exercise prices that are both
    near-the-money and close to the exercise price of the employee
    stock options; and

•

The remaining maturities of the traded options on which the
    estimate is based are at least one year.

When establishing the expected life assumption, Cadence reviews
    annual historical employee exercise behavior with respect to
    option grants having similar vesting periods. The risk-free
    interest rate for the period within the expected term of the
    option is based on the yield of United States Treasury notes in
    effect at the time of grant. Cadence has not historically paid
    dividends, thus the expected dividends used in the calculation
    are zero.

Judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock-based
    awards that Cadence expects to be forfeited. Cadence calculates
    a separate expected forfeiture rate for both stock options and
    restricted stock issuances based on historical trends. Judgment
    is also required to estimate the attainment of certain
    predetermined performance goals for a performance-based bonus
    plan, under which payments may be made in Cadence common stock,
    and performance-based restricted stock grants. Each period, we
    estimate the most likely outcome of such performance goals and
    recognize any related stock-based compensation expense. The
    amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized in any one
    period can vary based on the attainment or estimated attainment
    of the various performance goals. If such performance goals are
    not met, no compensation expense is recognized and any
    previously recognized compensation expense is reversed.

The valuation of all options, including the expected life of
    stock options, and the expected forfeiture rates for options and
    restricted stock, are calculated based on one employee pool
    because there is no significant difference in exercise behavior
    between classes of employees.

Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123R, Cadence made the
    election to calculate the tax effects of stock-based
    compensation expense using the alternative transition method
    pursuant to Financial Statement Position, or FSP,

No. 123R-3

and computed the beginning balance of the APIC tax benefit pool
    by applying the simplified method, which resulted in an APIC tax
    benefit pool windfall position. Accordingly, upon adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R, Cadence had cumulative excess tax
    benefits from stock-based compensation available in APIC that
    could be used to offset an equal amount of future tax shortfalls
    (i.e., when the amount of the tax deductible stock-based
    compensation is less than the related stock-based compensation
    cost).

Treasury
    Stock

Cadence records a gain or loss on re-issuance of treasury stock
    based on the total proceeds received in the transaction. Gains
    on the re-issuance of treasury stock are recorded as a component
    of Capital in excess of par in the Consolidated Statements of
    Stockholders’ Equity. Losses on the re-issuance of treasury
    stock are recorded as a component of Capital in excess of par to
    the extent that there are gains to offset the losses. If there
    are no treasury stock gains in Capital in excess of par, the
    losses upon re-issuance of treasury stock are recorded as a
    component of Retained earnings in the Consolidated Statements of
    Stockholders’ Equity. During 2007, Cadence recorded losses
    on the re-issuance of treasury stock of $24.4 million as a
    component of Retained earnings.

Concentrations
    of Credit Risk

Financial instruments, including derivative financial
    instruments, that may potentially subject Cadence to
    concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash and
    cash equivalents, short-term investments, long-term investments,
    accounts receivable and forward contracts. Concentration of
    credit risk related to accounts receivable is limited, due to
    the varied customers comprising Cadence’s customer base and
    their dispersion across geographical locations. Credit exposure
    related to the forward contracts is limited to the realized and
    unrealized gains on these contracts. Cadence issued options and
    warrants to hedge potential dilution of its convertible notes,
    as described more fully in Note 6. Changes in the fair
    value of these hedge and warrant



transactions are not marked to market and are not recognized in
    Cadence’s Consolidated Income Statement as long as the
    instruments remain classified as equity. All financial
    instruments are executed with financial institutions having
    strong credit ratings, which minimizes risk of loss due to
    nonpayment.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The fair value of Cadence’s cash and cash equivalents,
    short-term investments, receivables, accounts payable and
    foreign currency forward exchange contracts approximate their
    carrying value due to the short-term nature of these
    instruments. The fair market values of Cadence’s long-term
    investments, term loan and installment contract receivables
    approximate their carrying values based upon current market
    rates of interest. The fair value of Cadence’s convertible
    notes is influenced by interest rates and Cadence’s stock
    price and stock price volatility and is determined by market
    trading. As of December 29, 2007, the total fair market
    value of Cadence’s Convertible Senior Notes was
    $515.6 million and the total fair market value of
    Cadence’s 2023 Notes was $266.3 million. See
    Note 6 for the fair value of Cadence’s convertible
    note hedges and warrants.

Leases

Cadence uses operating leases in its operations. For leases that
    contain rent escalations or rent concessions, Cadence records
    the total rent payable during the lease term on a straight-line
    basis over the term of the lease. Cadence records the difference
    between the rents paid and the straight-line rent as a deferred
    rent liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Advertising

Cadence expenses the costs of advertising as incurred.
    Advertising expense was approximately $8.8 million in 2007,
    $10.5 million in 2006 and $9.0 million in 2005, and is
    included in Marketing and sales in the accompanying Consolidated
    Income Statements.

NOTE 3.  STOCK
    COMPENSATION PLANS

Equity
    Incentive Plans

Cadence’s 2000 Nonstatutory Equity Incentive Plan, or the
    2000 Plan, 1997 Nonstatutory Stock Incentive Plan, or 1997 Plan,
    and 1993 Nonstatutory Stock Incentive Plan, or 1993 Plan (the
    2000 Plan, the 1997 Plan and the 1993 Plan are referred to
    collectively as the Nonstatutory Stock Incentive Plans), provide
    for the issuance of non-qualified options, incentive stock,
    restricted stock units, stock bonuses and rights to acquire
    restricted stock to Cadence employees and consultants who are
    not executive officers, directors or beneficial owners of 10% or
    more of Cadence common stock. The number of shares available for
    issuance under the 2000 Plan is 50,000,000, under the 1997 Plan
    is 30,000,000 and under the 1993 Plan is 24,750,000. Options
    granted under the Nonstatutory Stock Incentive Plans have an
    exercise price not less than the fair market value of the stock
    on the date of grant. Options granted to new employees become
    exercisable over a period of up to four years, generally with
    one-fourth of the shares vesting one year from the vesting
    commencement date, and the remaining shares vesting in 36 equal
    monthly installments thereafter. Options granted to current
    employees become exercisable over a period of up to four years,
    generally vesting in 48 equal monthly installments. Options
    granted under the Nonstatutory Stock Incentive Plans prior to
    October 1, 2006 generally expire ten years from the date of
    grant. Options granted under the Nonstatutory Stock Incentive
    Plans after October 1, 2006 generally expire seven years
    from the date of grant. Awards of incentive stock and restricted
    stock units granted under the Nonstatutory Stock Incentive Plans
    vest at times and in installments approved by the Board of
    Directors or its Compensation Committee, on the basis of
    continued employment, passage of time

and/or

performance criteria.

Cadence’s 1987 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 1987 Plan,
    provides for the issuance of either incentive or non-qualified
    options and incentive stock. The number of shares available for
    issuance under the 1987 Plan is 75,370,100 shares, of which
    only 5,000,000 shares may be issued pursuant to incentive
    stock awards. Options granted under the 1987 Plan have an
    exercise price not less than fair market value of the stock on
    the date of grant and become exercisable over periods of up to
    five years. Options granted under the 1987 Plan prior to
    October 1, 2006 generally expire ten years from the date of
    grant. Options granted under the 1987 Plan after October 1,
    2006 generally expire seven years from the date of grant. Awards
    of incentive stock granted under the 1987 Plan vest at



times and in installments set forth in the 1987 Plan and
    approved by the Board of Directors or its Compensation
    Committee, on the basis of continued employment, passage of time

and/or

performance criteria.

Under the 1995 Directors’ Stock Option Plan, or the
    Directors’ Plan, Cadence may grant non-qualified options to
    its non-employee directors for up to 3,050,000 shares of
    common stock at an exercise price equal to the average of the
    closing price for 20 trading days prior to the grant date.
    Options granted under the Directors’ Plan prior to
    October 1, 2006 have terms of ten years and vest one year
    from the date of grant. Options granted under the
    Directors’ Plan after October 1, 2006 expire seven
    years from the date of grant and vest one year from the grant
    date.

Cadence has assumed certain options granted to employees of
    acquired companies, or Acquired Options. The Acquired Options
    were assumed by Cadence outside of its stock option plans, and
    each option is administered under the terms of the respective
    original plans of the acquired companies. All of the Acquired
    Options have been adjusted to effectuate the price conversion
    under the terms of the acquisition agreement between Cadence and
    the relevant acquired company. The Acquired Options generally
    become exercisable over a four or five year period and generally
    expire between five and ten years from the date of grant. No
    additional options will be granted under any of the acquired
    companies’ plans.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)

In November 1998, the Board of Directors adopted, and the
    Cadence stockholders subsequently approved, Cadence’s
    Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which amended
    and restated the 1990 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the ESPP.
    Subsequent amendments approved by the Board of Directors and
    Cadence stockholders increased the number of shares of common
    stock authorized for issuance under the ESPP to
    46,500,000 shares.

Under the ESPP, substantially all employees may purchase
    Cadence’s common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower
    of the fair market value at the beginning of the applicable
    offering period or at the end of each applicable purchase
    period, in an amount up to 12% of their annual base earnings
    plus bonuses and commissions, subject to a limit in any calendar
    year of $25,000 worth of common stock. The offering periods
    under the ESPP that began prior to August 1, 2006 were
    concurrent

24-month

offering periods. Each offering period was divided into four
    consecutive six-month purchase periods. All offering periods
    that started before August 1, 2006 continued until they
    were completed or until they were terminated as provided in the
    documents governing the ESPP. Participants in the ESPP remained
    in the

24-month

offering periods until these offering periods were completed or
    until such participant withdrew from the ESPP, whichever was
    earlier. Effective August 1, 2006, offering periods under
    the ESPP are six months with a corresponding six month purchase
    period. New offerings begin on each February 1st and
    August 1st, and those offerings run consecutively rather
    than concurrently. Participants were converted to the six-month
    offering periods starting with the next offering period in which
    the participants enroll on or after August 1, 2006.
    Beginning with the August 1, 2007 offering period, all
    participants have been participating in a six-month offering
    period and all

24-month

offering periods have been completed. The purchase dates under
    the ESPP are January 31st and July 31st of each
    year.

Stock-based compensation expense and the related income tax
    benefit recognized under SFAS No. 123R in the

Stock
    Options

The exercise price of each stock option granted under
    Cadence’s employee equity incentive plans is equal to or
    greater than the market price of Cadence’s common stock on
    the date of grant. The fair value of each option grant is
    estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
    pricing model. The weighted average grant date fair value of
    options granted and the weighted average assumptions used in the
    model for fiscal years 2007 and 2006 were as follows:

The decrease in Cadence’s expected life assumption from

    due to the decrease in the contractual life from 10 to
    7 years of options granted after October 1, 2006.

Cadence had total unrecognized compensation expense, net of

    $35.3 million as of December 29, 2007, which will be
    recognized over the remaining weighted average vesting period of
    2.0 years. The total intrinsic value of options exercised
    was $113.7 million during 2007 and $55.9 million
    during 2006. Cash received from stock option exercises was
    $211.5 million during 2007 and $114.9 million during
    2006.

Restricted
    Stock and Stock Bonuses

Generally, restricted stock awards vest over four years and are
    subject to the employee’s continuing service to Cadence.
    Cadence issues some of its restricted stock with
    performance-based vesting. The terms of these restricted stock
    grants are consistent with grants of restricted stock described
    above, with the exception that the shares vest not upon the mere
    passage of time, but upon the attainment of certain
    predetermined performance goals. Each period, Cadence estimates
    the most likely outcome of such performance goals and recognizes
    the related stock-based compensation expense. The amount of
    stock-based compensation expense recognized in any one period
    can vary based on the attainment or estimated attainment of the
    various performance goals. If such performance goals are not



met, no compensation expense is recognized and any previously
    recognized compensation expense is reversed. Cadence recorded
    stock-based compensation expense of $7.4 million during
    2007 and $4.4 million during 2006 related to these
    performance-based restricted stock grants. No expense was
    recorded in 2005 for performance-based restricted stock grants.

Cadence had total unrecognized compensation expense, net of

    $65.1 million as of December 29, 2007, which will be
    recognized over the remaining weighted average vesting period of
    2.6 years. The total fair value of restricted stock that
    vested was $61.3 million during fiscal 2007 and
    $36.7 million during fiscal 2006.

Liability-based
    Awards

Cadence maintains a performance-based bonus plan under which
    payments may be made in Cadence common stock. Each period,
    Cadence estimates the most likely outcome of predetermined
    performance goals and recognizes any related stock-based
    compensation expense. The amount of stock-based compensation
    expense recognized in any one period can vary based on the
    attainment or estimated attainment of the various performance
    goals. If such performance goals are not met, no compensation
    expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation
    expense is reversed. Cadence recorded stock-based compensation
    expense of $9.6 million in 2007 and $8.7 million in
    2006 related to this performance-based bonus plan. The dollar
    amount earned under this bonus plan is based on the achievement
    of the performance goals, and the number of shares to be issued
    under the plan is based on the average stock price for three
    days preceding the grant date. Stock issued under the
    performance-based bonus plan vests immediately. Cadence issued
    0.4 million shares, valued at $8.7 million, under the
    performance-based bonus plan in 2007 and 0.3 million
    shares, valued at $5.1 million, in 2006. No shares were
    issued under this plan in 2005.

Cumulative
    effect of change in accounting principle, net of tax

During the year ended December 30, 2006, a non-cash benefit
    of $0.4 million for estimated forfeitures of restricted
    stock previously expensed was recorded as of the
    SFAS No. 123R implementation date as a one-time
    cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of tax.
    Pursuant to APB No. 25, stock-based compensation expense
    was not previously reduced for estimated future forfeitures, but
    instead was reversed upon actual forfeiture.



Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)

Compensation expense is calculated using the fair value of the
    employees’ purchase rights under the Black-Scholes option
    pricing model. The weighted average grant date fair value of

For fixed awards, as defined by APB No. 25, Cadence
    amortized deferred stock-based compensation to expense using the
    straight-line method over the period that the stock options and
    restricted stock vest, which is generally three to four years.
    For variable awards, as defined by APB No. 25, stock-based
    compensation expense was recognized on an accelerated basis in
    accordance with FASB Interpretation, or FIN, No. 28,
    “Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other
    Variable Stock Option or Award Plans.”

CONVERTIBLE
    NOTES

1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2011 and
    1.500% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2013

In December 2006, Cadence issued $250.0 million principal
    amount of 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2011, or the
    2011 Notes, and $250.0 million of 1.500% Convertible
    Senior Notes Due 2013, or the 2013 Notes, and collectively, the
    Convertible Senior Notes, to three initial purchasers in a
    private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the
    Securities Act for resale to qualified institutional buyers
    pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. Cadence received net proceeds of
    approximately $487.0 million after transaction fees of
    approximately $13.0 million, including $12.0 million
    of underwriting discounts. A portion of the net proceeds
    totaling $228.5 million was used to purchase
    $189.6 million principal amount of Cadence’s Zero
    Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes Due 2023, or the 2023
    Notes.

Holders may convert their Convertible Senior Notes prior to
    maturity upon the occurrence of one of the following events:

•

The price of Cadence’s common stock reaches $27.50 during
    certain periods of time specified in the Convertible Senior
    Notes;

•

Specified corporate transactions occur; or

•

The trading price of the Convertible Senior Notes falls below a
    certain threshold.

On and after November 2, 2011, in the case of the 2011
    Notes, and November 1, 2013, in the case of 2013 Notes,
    until the close of business on the scheduled trading day
    immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert
    their Convertible Senior Notes at any time, regardless of the
    foregoing circumstances. Cadence may not redeem the Convertible
    Senior Notes prior to maturity.

The initial conversion rate for the Convertible Senior Notes is
    47.2813 shares of Cadence common stock per $1,000 principal
    amount of Convertible Senior Notes, equivalent to a conversion
    price of approximately $21.15 per share of Cadence common stock.
    Upon conversion, a holder will receive the sum of the daily
    settlement amounts, calculated on a proportionate basis for each
    day, during a specified observation period following the
    conversion date. The daily settlement amount during each date of
    the observation period consists of:

•

Cash up to the principal amount of the note; and

•

Cadence’s common stock to the extent that the conversion
    value exceeds the amount of cash paid upon conversion of the
    Convertible Senior Notes.

In addition, if a fundamental change occurs prior to maturity,
    Cadence will, in certain cases, increase the conversion rate by
    an additional amount up to $8.27 per share, for a holder that
    elects to convert its Convertible Senior Notes in connection
    with such fundamental change, which amount will be paid entirely
    in cash. A fundamental change is any transaction or event
    (whether by means of an exchange offer, liquidation, tender
    offer,



consolidation, merger, combination, reclassification,
    recapitalization or otherwise) in connection with which more
    than 50% of Cadence’s common stock is exchanged for,
    converted into, acquired for or constitutes solely the right to
    receive, consideration which is not at least 90% shares of
    common stock, or depositary receipts representing such shares,
    that are:

•

Listed on, or immediately after the transaction or event will be
    listed on, a United States national securities exchange; or

•

Approved, or immediately after the transaction or event will be
    approved, for quotation on a United States system of automated
    dissemination of quotations of securities prices similar to the
    NASDAQ National Market prior to its designation as a national
    securities exchange.

As of December 29, 2007, none of the conditions allowing
    the holders of the Convertible Senior Notes to convert had been
    met.

Cadence evaluated the embedded conversion option in accordance
    with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities” and concluded that the
    embedded conversion option contained within the Convertible
    Senior Notes should not be accounted for separately because the
    conversion option is indexed to Cadence’s common stock and
    is classified as Stockholders’ equity. Furthermore, Cadence
    evaluated the terms of the Notes for a beneficial conversion
    feature in accordance with EITF

No. 98-5,

“Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial
    Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion
    Ratios” and EITF

No. 00-27,

“Application of Issue

98-5

to
    Certain Convertible Instruments” and concluded there was no
    beneficial conversion feature at the commitment date based on
    the conversion rate of the Convertible Senior Notes relative to
    the commitment date stock price.

Interest on the Convertible Senior Notes began accruing in
    December 2006 and is payable semi-annually each
    December 15th and June 15th.

Concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes,
    Cadence entered into hedge transactions with various parties
    whereby Cadence has the option to purchase up to
    23.6 million shares of Cadence’s common stock at a
    price of $21.15 per share, subject to adjustment. These options
    expire on December 15, 2011, in the case of the 2011 Notes,
    and December 15, 2013, in the case of the 2013 Notes, and
    must be settled in net shares. The aggregate cost of these hedge
    transactions was $119.8 million and has been recorded as a
    reduction to Stockholders’ equity in accordance with EITF

No. 00-19,

“Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed
    to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own
    Stock.” The estimated fair value of the hedges acquired in
    connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes was
    $98.1 million as of December 29, 2007. Subsequent
    changes in the fair value of these hedges will not be recognized
    as long as the instruments remain classified as equity.

In separate transactions, Cadence also sold warrants to various
    parties for the purchase of up to 23.6 million shares of
    Cadence’s common stock at a price of $31.50 per share in a
    private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the
    Securities Act. The warrants expire on various dates from
    February 2012 through April 2012 in the case of the 2011 Notes,
    and February 2014 through April 2014 in the case of the 2013
    Notes, and must be settled in net shares. Cadence received
    $39.4 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these
    warrants, which has been recorded as a reduction to
    Stockholders’ equity in accordance with EITF

No. 00-19.

The estimated fair value of the warrants sold in connection with
    the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes was
    $35.7 million as of December 29, 2007. Subsequent
    changes in the fair value of these warrants will not be
    recognized as long as the instruments remain classified as
    equity. The warrants will be included in diluted earnings per
    share, or EPS, to the extent the impact is not considered
    anti-dilutive.

SFAS No. 128, “Earnings per Share” and EITF

No. 04-08,

“Accounting Issues Related to Certain Features of
    Contingently Convertible Debt and the Effect on Diluted Earnings
    per Share,” requires Cadence to include in diluted earnings
    per share the shares of Cadence’s common stock into which
    the Convertible Senior Notes will be converted. However, since
    the Convertible Senior Notes meet the qualification of an
    Instrument C under EITF

No. 90-19,

“Convertible Bonds with Issuer Option to Settle for Cash
    Upon Conversion,” and because cash will be paid for the
    principal amount of the obligation upon conversion, the only
    shares that will be considered for inclusion in diluted EPS are
    those relating to the excess of the conversion premium over the
    principal amount in accordance with SFAS No. 128 and
    EITF Topic D-72, “Effect of Contracts That May Be Settled
    in Stock or Cash on the Computation of Diluted Earnings per
    Share.” As of December 29, 2007, no shares are
    included in diluted EPS for the Convertible Senior Notes.



In the event Cadence’s common stock exceeds $21.15 per
    share, for the first $1.00 the price exceeds $21.15, there would
    be dilution of approximately 1.1 million shares, but the
    impact on the calculation of EPS will vary depending on when
    during the year the $21.15 per share price is reached. As the
    share price continues to increase, dilution would continue to
    occur but at a declining rate.

Zero Coupon Zero Yield Senior Convertible Notes Due 2023

In August 2003, Cadence issued $420.0 million principal
    amount of its 2023 Notes to two initial purchasers in a private
    placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act
    for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC
    Rule 144A. Cadence received net proceeds of
    $406.4 million after transaction fees of $13.6 million
    that were recorded in Other long-term assets and are being
    amortized to interest expense using the straight-line method
    over five years, which is the duration of the first redemption
    period. The 2023 Notes were issued by Cadence at par and bear no
    interest. The 2023 Notes are convertible into Cadence common
    stock initially at a conversion price of $15.65 per share, which
    would result in an aggregate of 26.8 million shares issued
    upon conversion, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of
    specified events. In connection with the issuance of the
    Convertible Senior Notes in December 2006, Cadence repurchased
    $189.6 million principal amount of the 2023 Notes, reducing
    the aggregate number of shares to be issued upon conversion to
    14.7 million.

Cadence may redeem for cash all or any part of the 2023 Notes on
    or after August 15, 2008 for 100.00% of the principal
    amount. The holders of the 2023 Notes may require Cadence to
    repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2023 Notes on
    August 15, 2008 for 100.25% of the principal amount, on
    August 15, 2013 for 100.00% of the principal amount or on
    August 15, 2018 for 100.00% of the principal amount, by
    providing to the paying agent a written repurchase notice. The
    repurchase notice must be delivered during the period commencing
    30 business days prior to the relevant repurchase date and
    ending on the close of business on the business day prior to the
    relevant repurchase date. In addition, Cadence may redeem for
    cash all or any part of the 2023 Notes on or after
    August 15, 2008 for 100.00% of the principal amount, except
    for those 2023 Notes that holders have required Cadence to
    repurchase on August 15, 2008 or on other repurchase dates,
    as described above. Because the 2023 Notes can be redeemed by
    the holders on August 15, 2008, the 2023 Notes are
    classified as a Current liability in Cadence’s Consolidated
    Balance Sheet as of December 29, 2007.

Each $1,000 of principal of the 2023 Notes will initially be
    convertible into 63.8790 shares of Cadence common stock,
    subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events.
    Holders of the 2023 Notes may convert their 2023 Notes prior to
    maturity only if:

•

The price of Cadence common stock reaches $22.69 during certain
    periods of time specified in the 2023 Notes;

•

Specified corporate transactions occur;

•

The 2023 Notes have been called for redemption; or

•

The trading price of the 2023 Notes falls below a certain
    threshold.

As the fourth conversion feature is linked to the trading price
    of the 2023 Notes, which are traded in an observable market that
    differs from the one in which Cadence’s common stock is
    traded, the conversion feature meets the definition of a
    derivative that must be accounted for separately at fair value.
    The fair value of this conversion feature was not material at
    inception of the 2023 Notes or as of December 29, 2007. As
    of December 29, 2007, none of the conditions allowing
    holders of the 2023 Notes to convert had been met.

In the event of a fundamental change in Cadence’s corporate
    ownership or structure, the holders may require Cadence to
    repurchase all or any portion of their 2023 Notes for 100.00% of
    the principal amount. Upon a fundamental change in
    Cadence’s corporate ownership or structure, in certain
    circumstances Cadence may choose to pay the repurchase price in
    cash, shares of Cadence common stock or a combination of cash
    and shares of Cadence common stock. As of December 29,
    2007, none of the conditions allowing the holders of the 2023
    Notes to convert had been met.

In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes
    in December 2006, a portion of the proceeds were used to
    purchase in the open market 2023 Notes with a principal balance
    of $189.6 million for a total purchase price of
    $228.5 million. In connection with this purchase, Cadence
    incurred expenses of $40.8 million for the early
    extinguishment of debt. The loss on early extinguishment of debt
    included the call premium on the purchased 2023 Notes and the
    write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred debt issuance
    costs.



Concurrently with the issuance of the 2023 Notes, Cadence
    entered into hedge transactions with a financial institution
    whereby Cadence originally acquired options to purchase up to
    26.8 million shares of Cadence common stock at a price of
    $15.65 per share. These options expire on August 15, 2008
    and must be settled in net shares. The cost of the hedge
    transactions to Cadence was $134.6 million. In connection
    with the purchase of a portion of the 2023 Notes in December
    2006, Cadence also sold 12.1 million of the hedges that
    were originally purchased in connection with the 2023 Notes and
    received proceeds of $55.9 million.

In addition, Cadence sold warrants for its common stock to a
    financial institution for the purchase of up to
    26.8 million shares of Cadence common stock at a price of
    $23.08 per share. The warrants expire on various dates from
    February 2008 through May 2008 and must be settled in net
    shares. Cadence received $56.4 million in cash proceeds
    from the sale of these warrants. In connection with the purchase
    of a portion of the 2023 Notes in December 2006, Cadence also
    purchased 12.1 million of the warrants for its common stock
    that were originally issued in connection with the 2023 Notes at
    a cost of $10.2 million. The remaining outstanding warrants
    will be included in diluted EPS to the extent the impact is not
    considered anti-dilutive.

The costs incurred in connection with the hedge transaction and
    the proceeds from the sale of the warrants are included as a net
    reduction in Common stock and capital in excess of par in the
    accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 29,
    2007 and December 30, 2006, in accordance with the guidance
    in EITF

No. 00-19.

Additionally, the cost to purchase a portion of the warrants and
    the proceeds received from selling a portion of the notes hedges
    during December 2006 have also been recorded to stockholders
    equity. As of December 29, 2007, the estimated fair value
    of the remaining hedges acquired in connection with the issuance
    of the 2023 Notes was $39.0 million and the estimated fair
    value of the remaining warrants sold in connection with the
    issuance of the 2023 Notes was $0.2 million. Subsequent
    changes in the fair value of these hedge and warrant
    transactions will not be recognized as long as the instruments
    remain classified as equity.

For the year ended December 29, 2007, a weighted average of
    14.7 million common shares were included in diluted EPS for
    the 2023 Notes. There will be no other impact on basic or
    dilutive EPS for the 2023 Notes unless the price of
    Cadence’s common stock exceeds the warrant strike price of
    $23.08 per share. Up to $23.08 per share, in connection with any
    conversion, the operation of the hedge transactions and sale of
    the warrants would effectively result in no impact on basic or
    dilutive EPS. In the event Cadence’s common stock exceeds
    $23.08 per share, for the first $1.00 the price exceeds $23.08,
    there would be dilution of approximately 0.6 million
    shares, but the impact on the calculation of EPS will vary
    depending on when during the year the $23.08 per share price is
    reached. As the share price continues to increase, dilution
    would continue to occur but at a declining rate. If these
    transactions settle in Cadence’s favor, Cadence could be
    exposed to credit risk related to the other party to the
    transactions.

    or Credit Agreement, with Banc of America Securities LLC as lead
    arranger, and Bank of America, N.A. as Administrative Agent.
    During the year ended December 30, 2006, Castlewilder made

As of December 29, 2007, Cadence had total net deferred tax
    assets of approximately $250.6 million. Realization of the
    deferred tax assets will depend on generating sufficient taxable
    income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate
    jurisdictions prior to the expiration of certain net operating
    loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards. Although
    realization is not assured, management believes that it is more
    likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be
    realized.

The valuation allowance decreased by $0.8 million during
    2007 based on estimated realization of deferred tax assets in
    future years. As of December 29, 2007, the valuation
    allowance was $5.1 million and is related to certain state
    net operating losses and tax credits, and certain foreign
    capital loss carryforwards, the utilization of which is not
    likely based on Cadence’s estimation of future taxable
    income in these states and future foreign capital gains.

Cadence provides for United States income taxes on the earnings
    of foreign subsidiaries unless the earnings are considered
    indefinitely invested outside of the United States. As of
    December 29, 2007, the cumulative amount of earnings upon
    which United States income taxes have not been provided was
    approximately $424.2 million. As of December 29, 2007,
    the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings was
    approximately $139.8 million. Cadence intends to
    indefinitely reinvest its foreign earnings outside of the United
    States.

As of December 29, 2007, Cadence had federal and California
    net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
    $34.8 million and $27.1 million, respectively,
    available to reduce future taxable income. The federal net
    operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates from
    2008 through 2026. The California net operating loss
    carryforwards will expire at various dates from 2012 through
    2016. Cadence also has tax effected net operating losses from
    states other than California of $1.8 million, net of
    federal tax benefit, which will expire at various dates from
    2008 through 2025.

As of December 29, 2007, Cadence had federal tax credits of
    $10.3 million, California credits of $14.3 million,
    net of federal tax benefit, credits from states other than
    California of $4.1 million, net of federal tax benefit and
    $0.5 million of tax credits in foreign jurisdictions.
    $16.0 million of these tax credits do not expire and carry
    forward indefinitely until utilized and the remaining
    $13.2 million of tax credits will expire at various dates
    from 2008 through 2027.



The cumulative effect of adopting FIN No. 48 was
    reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained
    earnings (or other appropriate components of equity or net
    assets) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for fiscal 2007.
    Cadence recognized a $59.4 million decrease in the net
    liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted
    for as an increase to the December 31, 2006 balance of
    retained earnings. Cadence also recognized a $42.6 million
    decrease in the net liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits,
    which was accounted for as a $35.3 million increase in the
    December 31, 2006 balance of Common stock and capital in
    excess of par value and a $7.3 million decrease in the
    December 31, 2006 balance of Goodwill.

Upon adoption of FIN No. 48, Cadence also recognized
    additional long-term income tax assets of $115.0 million
    and additional long-term income tax liabilities of
    $115.0 million to present the unrecognized tax benefits as
    gross amounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Cadence also
    decreased current income tax liabilities by $26.2 million
    and increased long-term income tax liabilities by the same
    amount based on its anticipation of the amount of cash payments
    to be made within one year.

The Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and other tax authorities
    regularly examine Cadence’s income tax returns.
    Cadence’s United States federal income tax returns
    beginning with the 1997 tax year remain subject to examination
    by the IRS. Cadence’s California income tax returns
    beginning with the 2001 tax year remain subject to examination
    by the California Franchise Tax Board.

In November 2003, the IRS completed its field examination of
    Cadence’s federal income tax returns for the tax years 1997
    through 1999 and issued a Revenue Agent’s Report, or RAR,
    in which the IRS proposed to assess an aggregate tax deficiency
    for the three-year period of approximately $143.0 million.
    The most significant of the disputed adjustments for the tax
    years 1997 through 1999 related to transfer pricing arrangements
    that Cadence had with a foreign subsidiary. In December 2007,
    the Joint Committee on Taxation of the U.S. Congress, or
    the Joint Committee, approved and the Appeals Office of the IRS,
    or the Appeals Office, executed settlement agreements, which
    resulted in an effective settlement of the transfer pricing
    dispute for purposes of FIN No. 48. As a result of
    this effective settlement, Cadence recognized a tax benefit of
    $27.8 million in the Consolidated Income Statement. Cadence
    also recognized a tax benefit of $6.2 million in the
    Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity and
    Comprehensive Income as a result of this effective settlement.

Cadence did not reach a settlement with the Appeals Office of
    the IRS on separate tax refund claims that would increase its
    tax deductions for foreign trade income for the tax years 1997
    through 1999. Cadence continues to believe that its position is
    well supported and Cadence is currently considering its options
    for further pursuing this matter.

In July 2006, the IRS completed its field examination of
    Cadence’s federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000
    through 2002 and issued an RAR in which the IRS proposed to
    assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year period of
    approximately $324.0 million. In November 2006, the IRS
    revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency for the three-year
    period to be approximately $318.0 million. The IRS is
    contesting Cadence’s qualification for deferred recognition
    of certain proceeds received from restitution and settlement in
    connection with litigation during the period. The proposed tax
    deficiency for this item is approximately $152.0 million.
    The remaining proposed tax deficiency of approximately
    $166.0 million is primarily related to proposed adjustments
    to Cadence’s transfer pricing arrangements that it had with
    foreign subsidiaries and to Cadence’s deductions for
    foreign trade income. The IRS may make similar claims against
    our transfer pricing arrangements and deductions for foreign
    trade income in future examinations. Cadence has filed a timely
    protest with the IRS and will seek resolution of the issues
    through the Appeals Office.

Cadence believes that the proposed IRS adjustments are
    inconsistent with applicable tax laws and Cadence is vigorously
    challenging these proposed adjustments. The RAR is not a final
    Statutory Notice of Deficiency but the IRS imposes interest on
    the proposed deficiencies until the matters are resolved.
    Interest is compounded daily at rates published by the IRS,
    which rates are adjusted quarterly and have been between 4% and
    10% since 2001. The IRS is currently examining Cadence’s
    federal income tax returns for the tax years 2003 through 2005.

ACQUISITIONS

For each of the acquisitions described below, the results of
    operations and the estimated fair value of the assets acquired
    and liabilities assumed have been included in Cadence’s
    Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the
    acquisition.

Comparative pro forma financial information for all 2007, 2006
    and 2005 acquisitions have not been presented because the
    results of operations were not material to Cadence’s
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

    Acquisitions

During 2007, Cadence acquired Invarium, Inc., a
    San Jose-based developer of advanced lithography-modeling
    and pattern-synthesis technology, and Clear Shape Technologies,
    Inc., a San Jose-based design for manufacturing technology
    company specializing in design-side solutions to minimize yield
    loss for advanced semiconductor integrated circuits. Cadence
    acquired these two companies for an aggregate purchase price of
    $75.5 million, which included the payment of cash, the fair
    value of assumed options and acquisition costs. The
    $45.7 million of goodwill recorded in connection with these
    acquisitions is not expected to be deductible for income tax
    purposes. Prior to acquiring Clear Shape Technologies, Inc.,
    Cadence had an investment of $2.0 million in the company,
    representing a 12% ownership interest, which had been accounted
    for under the cost method of accounting. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations,”
    Cadence accounted for this acquisition as a step acquisition.
    Subsequent adjustments to the purchase price of these acquired
    companies are included in the “Other” line of the
    changes of goodwill table in Note 10 below.

    Acquisition

In March 2006, Cadence acquired a company for an aggregate
    initial purchase price of $25.8 million, which included the
    payment of cash, the fair value of assumed options and
    acquisition costs. The preliminary allocation of the purchase
    price was recorded as $17.4 million of goodwill,
    $9.4 million of identifiable intangible assets and
    $(1.0) million of net liabilities. The $17.4 million
    of goodwill recorded in connection with this acquisition is not
    expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Subsequent
    adjustments to the purchase price of this acquired company are
    included in the “Other” line of the changes of
    goodwill table in Note 10 below.



    Acquisition

In April 2005, Cadence acquired Verisity Ltd., or Verisity, an
    Israeli corporation. Verisity was a publicly-held provider of
    verification process automation solutions. Cadence purchased
    Verisity to acquire key personnel and technology. The aggregate
    initial purchase price was $325.4 million, which included
    the payment of $304.6 million of cash, $10.6 million
    of assumed options at fair value, $6.9 million of
    acquisition costs and $3.3 million of contract termination
    costs. For tax purposes, approximately $160.0 million of
    the goodwill is expected to be deductible. Subsequent
    adjustments to the purchase price of this acquired company are
    included in the “Other” line of the changes of
    goodwill table in Note 10 below.

Acquisition-Related
    Earnouts

For many of Cadence’s previously completed acquisitions,
    payment of a portion of the purchase price is contingent upon
    the acquired business’ achievement of certain revenue and
    product development performance goals. The portion of the
    contingent purchase price, or earnout, associated with employee
    retention is recorded as compensation expense. The specific
    performance goal levels, and amounts and timing of earnout
    payments, vary with each acquisition.

During the year ended December 29, 2007, Cadence recorded
    $4.1 million of goodwill for achieved earnouts paid in cash
    to former stockholders of acquired companies. In addition,
    Cadence recorded $0.3 million in compensation expense
    related to these earnouts during the year ended
    December 29, 2007.

During the year ended December 30, 2006, Cadence recorded
    $18.6 million of goodwill for achieved earnouts paid in
    cash to former stockholders of acquired companies. In addition,
    Cadence recorded $1.4 million in compensation expense
    related to these earnouts during the year ended
    December 30, 2006.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, Cadence recorded
    $27.5 million of goodwill for achieved earnouts payable to
    former stockholders of acquired companies. The
    $27.5 million of earnouts consisted of $26.2 million
    of cash payments and the issuance of 0.1 million shares of
    Cadence’s common stock valued at $1.3 million.

Write-off
    of Acquired In-Process Research and Development

Acquired in-process research and development charges represent
    in-process research and development that had not reached
    technological feasibility at the time of acquisition and had no
    probable alternative future use.

For acquisitions completed during 2007, 2006 and 2005, the
    purchase price allocated to acquired in-process research and
    development was determined through established valuation
    techniques. The acquired in-process research and development was
    immediately expensed because technological feasibility had not
    been established, and no future alternative use existed. The
    write-off of acquired in-process research and development is a
    component of operating expenses in the Consolidated Income
    Statements.

Described below are the write-offs of acquired in-process
    research and development charges in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005.

GOODWILL
    AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES

Goodwill

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets,” Cadence conducts an annual
    impairment analysis of goodwill, which it completed during the
    third quarter of 2007. Based on the results of the impairment
    review, Cadence determined that no indicators of impairment
    existed for its reporting unit during 2007.

For purposes of SFAS No. 142, Cadence operates under
    one reporting unit. Cadence’s annual impairment review
    process compares the fair value of its reporting unit to its
    carrying value, including the goodwill related to the



reporting unit. To determine the reporting unit’s fair
    value, Cadence utilized the market valuation approach in the
    current year evaluation.

The market approach provides an estimate of the fair value of
    Cadence based on the total number of Cadence common shares
    outstanding, multiplied by the price per common share. The
    estimated fair value is then compared to the carrying value of
    Cadence’s net assets. If the carrying value of
    Cadence’s net assets is greater than the aggregate market
    value of its common shares outstanding, additional fair value
    analyses are performed on the individual intangible assets,
    including goodwill, to determine if any intangible assets are
    impaired, and, if so, an impairment charge is recorded.

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years
    ended December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 are as
    follows:

SALES OF
    INSTALLMENT CONTRACT RECEIVABLES

From time-to-time, Cadence transfers installment contract
    receivables on a non-recourse or limited-recourse basis to third
    party financing institutions. These transfers are recorded as
    sales and accounted for in accordance with
    SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and
    Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
    Liabilities.” The following table shows the amounts of
    accounts receivable transferred to financing institutions on a
    non-recourse basis in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005:

Losses on the sale of receivables are included in General and

Non-Marketable
    Securities

Cadence uses either the cost or equity method of accounting to
    account for its long-term, non-marketable investment securities,
    which are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. Net realized gains on the sale of non-marketable
    investments were $6.0 million in 2007, $19.9 million
    in 2006 and $2.5 million in 2005. In addition,
    Cadence’s 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment
    Plan Trust recorded a gain of $0.6 million in 2007 and
    $2.7 million in 2006. If Cadence determines that an
    other-than-temporary decline exists in a non-marketable equity
    security, Cadence writes down the investment to its fair value
    and records the related write-down as an investment loss in the
    Consolidated Income Statements.



The following table illustrates the carrying value of

    included in Other income, net, in the Consolidated Income
    Statements.

In January 2006, KhiMetrics, Inc., a cost method investment held
    by Telos Venture Partners, a limited partnership in which
    Cadence and its 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment
    Plan Trust are the sole limited partners, was sold for
    consideration of $6.53 per share of common stock. In connection
    with this sale, Cadence received approximately
    $20.2 million in cash and recorded a gain of approximately
    $17.1 million during the year ended December 30, 2006.
    In addition, the 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment
    Plan Trust received $2.9 million in cash and recorded a
    gain of $2.5 million during the year ended
    December 30, 2006. Under the purchase agreement, an
    additional 10% of the consideration was held in escrow, which
    was released to Cadence and to the trust in January 2007. Upon
    receipt of these additional proceeds, Cadence recorded a gain of
    $2.6 million and the 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture
    Investment Plan Trust recorded a gain of $0.4 million in
    the year ended December 29, 2007.

Equity
    Method Investments

Cadence’s voting interest in its equity method investments
    ranged from approximately 10% to 46% of the following
    privately-held companies: Accent International S.A., D2S, Inc.,
    FyreStorm, Inc., GSR Associates II, L.P., Shanghai SVA
    Integrated Circuits Co., Ltd. and ZCIST Co., Ltd.

    equity method gains and losses in the quarter following the
    quarter in which these gains or losses actually occur because it
    is not practicable to obtain investee financial statements prior
    to the issuance of Cadence’s Consolidated Financial
    Statements. In addition, Cadence records impairment losses of
    equity method investments if an other-than-temporary decline in
    value exists. These



write-downs are included in Other income, net, in the
    Consolidated Income Statements. Cadence’s proportional

NOTE 14.
    CONTINGENCIES

Legal
    Proceedings

From time to time, Cadence is involved in various disputes and
    litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of
    business. These include disputes and lawsuits related to
    intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, licensing,
    contracts, distribution arrangements and employee relations
    matters. At least quarterly, Cadence reviews the status of each
    significant matter and assesses its potential financial
    exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal
    proceeding is considered probable and the amount or the range of
    loss can be estimated, Cadence accrues a liability for the
    estimated loss in accordance with SFAS No. 5,
    “Accounting for Contingencies.” Legal proceedings are
    subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to
    predict. Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based only
    on the best information available at the time. As additional
    information becomes available, Cadence reassesses the potential
    liability related to pending claims and litigation matters and
    may revise estimates.

On February 8, 2007, Cadence, Magma Design Automation,
    Inc., or Magma, Altera Corp., or Altera, and Mentor Graphics
    Corp., or Mentor, filed a complaint in the United States
    District Court for the Northern District of California against
    an individual, Narpat Bhandari, or Bhandari, and Vanguard
    Systems, Inc., or Vanguard. The complaint sought a declaratory
    judgment that U.S. Patent No. 5,663,900, or the
    ’900 Patent, which discloses an electronic simulation and
    emulation system and is allegedly owned by Bhandari and
    Vanguard, is not infringed and is invalid and unenforceable. The
    Complaint further sought a declaratory judgment that LSI Logic
    Corporation, or LSI, has an ownership interest in the ’900
    Patent that precludes Bhandari and Vanguard from asserting the
    patent without first joining LSI. In March 2007,



Cadence, Magma, Altera and Mentor amended the complaint to
    further plead non-infringement on the basis of obtaining a
    license to the ’900 Patent from its co-owner, LSI. In April
    2007, Bhandari and Vanguard answered the amended complaint,
    asserting counterclaims alleging that certain products of
    Cadence and the other plaintiffs infringed the ’900 Patent.
    In a case management conference held on May 21, 2007, the
    court granted the request of Cadence, Magma, Altera and Mentor
    to bifurcate the case and stay all issues except for the
    question of LSI’s ownership interest in the ’900
    Patent. Cadence, Magma, Altera and Mentor filed a Motion for
    Summary Judgment that LSI was a joint-owner and that the license
    from LSI warranted dismissal of Bhandari and Vanguard’s
    claim, which the court granted in favor of Cadence, Magma,
    Altera and Mentor. On December 4, 2007, the court issued an
    order entering judgment in favor of Cadence, Magma, Altera and
    Mentor and against Bhandari and Vanguard, thus bringing this
    matter to a close.

On May 30, 2007, Ahmed Higazi, a former Cadence employee,
    filed suit against Cadence in the United States District Court
    for the Northern District of California alleging that Cadence
    improperly classified him and a class of other Cadence
    information technology employees as exempt from overtime pay.
    The suit alleges claims for unpaid overtime under the federal
    Fair Labor Standards Act and California law, waiting-time
    penalties under the California Labor Code, failure to provide
    proper earnings statements under California law, failure to
    provide meal periods and rest breaks as required by California
    law, unfair business practices under California
    Business & Professions Code section 17200, and
    unpaid 401(k) contributions in violation of the Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. On June 20, 2007,
    Cadence answered plaintiff’s complaint, denying its
    material allegations and raising a number of affirmative
    defenses, and on December 19, 2007, Cadence filed an
    amended answer. A period of discovery conducted by both sides
    then ensued, followed, in January 2008, by a private mediation
    of the case. At the mediation, the parties were successful in
    resolving their respective differences, and have entered into a
    settlement agreement without contesting the merits of the claims
    or admitting liability. The parties are in the process of
    preparing the various papers for court approval of the
    settlement. Final approval is not expected to occur until the
    third quarter of 2008. Cadence has accrued for the expected
    settlement in its Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
    December 29, 2007.

While the outcome of these litigation matters cannot be
    predicted with any certainty, management does not believe that
    the outcome of any current matters will have a material adverse
    effect on Cadence’s consolidated financial position,
    liquidity or results of operations.

Other
    Contingencies

Cadence provides its customers with a warranty on sales of
    hardware products for a

90-day

period. These warranties are accounted for in accordance with
    SFAS No. 5. To date, Cadence has not incurred any
    significant costs related to warranty obligations.

Cadence’s product license and services agreements include a
    limited indemnification provision for claims from third parties
    relating to Cadence’s intellectual property. Such
    indemnification provisions are accounted for in accordance with
    SFAS No. 5. The indemnification is generally limited
    to the amount paid by the customer. To date, claims under such
    indemnification provisions have not been significant.

NOTE 15.
    NET INCOME PER SHARE

Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income,
    the numerator, by the weighted average number of shares of
    common stock outstanding, less unvested restricted stock, the
    denominator, during the period. Diluted net income per share
    gives effect to equity instruments considered to be potential
    common shares, if dilutive, computed using the treasury stock
    method of accounting.

Cadence accounts for the effect of its 2023 Notes in the diluted
    earnings per share, or EPS, calculation using the if-converted
    method of accounting. Under that method, the 2023 Notes are
    assumed to be converted to shares (weighted for the number of
    days outstanding in the period) at a conversion price of $15.65,
    and amortization of transaction fees, net of taxes, related to
    the 2023 Notes is added back to net income.

EITF

No. 04-08

requires Cadence to include in diluted earnings per share the
    shares of Cadence’s common stock into which the Convertible
    Senior Notes will be converted. However, since the Convertible
    Senior Notes meet the qualification of an Instrument C under
    EITF

No. 90-19

and because cash will be paid for the principal amount of the
    obligation upon conversion, the only shares that will be
    considered for inclusion in diluted EPS are those relating to
    the excess of the conversion premium over the principal amount,
    using the “if-converted” method. As of
    December 29, 2007, no shares are included in diluted EPS
    for the Convertible Senior Notes.

    EMPLOYEE AND DIRECTOR BENEFIT PLANS

Cadence maintains a 401(k) savings plan to provide retirement
    benefits through tax-deferred salary deductions for all of its
    United States employees. Cadence may make discretionary
    contributions, as determined by the Board of Directors, which
    cannot exceed a specified percentage of the annual aggregate
    salaries of those employees eligible to participate. Cadence
    made total contributions to the plan of $12.2 million in
    2007, $11.4 million in 2006 and $10.8 million in 2005.

Executive Officers and Directors may also elect to defer
    compensation payable to them under Cadence’s 1994
    Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan. Deferred compensation
    payments are held in accounts with values indexed to the
    performance of selected mutual funds or money market accounts.
    These investments are classified as trading securities on
    Cadence’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and gains and losses
    are recognized as income (expense) in the Consolidated Income
    Statements. Net recognized appreciation of trading securities in

Cadence adopted FIN No. 48 on December 31, 2006,
    the first day of fiscal 2007. The cumulative effect of adopting
    FIN No. 48 was reported as an adjustment to the
    opening balance of retained earnings (or other appropriate
    components of equity or net assets) in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheet for fiscal 2007, which amounts were non-cash items in
    Cadence’s 2007 Statement of Cash Flows. See Note 8

On October 5, 2007, Cadence completed a lease termination
    agreement for a facility included in the 2001 restructuring
    plan, whereby Cadence paid $8.2 million and was released
    from all future obligations related to the facility. Cadence
    recorded a credit to Restructuring and other charges of
    $7.1 million during the year ended December 29, 2007,
    representing the lease loss accrual related to this facility in
    excess of the amount paid.

During 2005, Cadence recorded Restructuring and other charges of
    $35.3 million, which included $20.4 million of
    workforce reduction costs associated primarily with its 2005
    restructuring plan, and excess facility costs of
    $12.5 million, which consisted primarily of changes in
    lease loss estimates for facilities included in its 2001, 2002
    and 2003 restructuring plans.

Each reporting period, Cadence evaluates the adequacy of the
    lease loss accrual. Cadence adjusts the lease loss accrual for
    changes in real estate markets or other factors that may affect
    estimated costs or sublease income. Cadence also considers
    executed sublease agreements and adjusts the lease loss accrual
    if sublease income under the agreement differs from initial
    estimates. The credits recorded during the fiscal years 2007 and
    2006 primarily relate to changes in lease loss estimates.

As of December 29, 2007, Cadence’s total amount
    accrued for restructuring and other charges of
    $10.2 million consisted solely of estimated lease losses
    related to the restructuring activities initiated since 2001.
    This amount may be adjusted in the future based upon changes in
    the assumptions used to estimate the lease loss. Of the
    $10.2 million, $2.5 million was included in Accounts
    payable and accrued liabilities and $7.7 million was
    included in Other long-term liabilities.

SEGMENT
    REPORTING

SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an
    Enterprise and Related Information,” requires disclosures
    of certain information regarding operating segments, products
    and services, geographic areas of operation and major customers.
    SFAS No. 131 reporting is based upon the
    “management approach”: how management organizes the
    company’s operating segments for which separate financial
    information is (i) available and (ii) evaluated
    regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how
    to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
    Cadence’s chief operating decision maker is its President
    and Chief Executive Officer, or CEO.

Cadence’s CEO reviews Cadence’s consolidated results
    within one operating segment. In making operating decisions, the
    CEO primarily considers consolidated financial information,
    accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by
    geographic region.

Outside the United States, Cadence markets and supports its
    products and services primarily through its subsidiaries.
    Revenue is attributed to geography based on the country in which
    the product is used or services are delivered. Long-lived assets
    are attributed to geography based on the country where the
    assets are located.
