Factors Driving The Electronic Design
Automation Industry

During the last decade, the worldwide electronics
industry has experienced expansion, driven largely by the
communications, business productivity and consumer electronics
markets. Ever-decreasing silicon manufacturing process
geometries coupled with the move to 300mm wafer production
is driving integrated circuit cost decreases, volume increases
and increasingly higher complexity for providers of electronics
devices. At the same time, the development of more comprehensive
integrated circuits complicates effective integration of
components into complete electronic systems. From a design
perspective, today’s complex ICs are system-on-a-chip,
or SoC, devices. These SoC devices, as described in more
detail below, contain one or more processors, memory and
application-specific logic. Designing these SoC devices requires
the convergence of what have previously been distinct domains
for embedded software, digital logic, analog circuitry and
printed circuit board, or PCB, design. This design
convergence is changing the way companies create designs for
these devices. These market and technology forces pose major
challenges for the global electronics design community, and
consequently create significant opportunities and challenges for
EDA tools and services providers.

The electronics industry is faced with increasing
complexity of electronic devices. Design teams face major
challenges in the migration to deep submicron design and SoC
design.

Deep submicron design refers to the design of
integrated circuits that will have feature sizes smaller than
0.25 micron. IC feature sizes for wires, transistors
and contacts decrease with each advance in the semiconductor
manufacturing process. Each successive move to a smaller feature
size (e.g., decreasing from 0.25 microns to
0.13 microns and smaller) requires introducing new
capabilities throughout the entire design



and manufacturing flow to account for new
physical effects. For example, at 0.13 microns signal
integrity issues such as crosstalk, IR (voltage) drop, and
substrate noise have become critical.

SoC design refers to implementing an entire
electronics sub-system on a single integrated circuit. Smaller
feature sizes make it more economical to put additional
circuitry on a single die. The ICs fabricated on these dies
include one or more processors (microprocessors and digital
signal processors), a high-performance bus, numerous memory
devices and peripherals, custom digital logic, custom analog
logic and millions of lines of software code. Such devices offer
benefits in terms of price, performance, power and size.
However, they are extremely difficult to design.

These trends pose significant new challenges for
electronics design teams. Specifically, deep submicron design
requires designers to take into account many physical effects
they previously ignored. SoC design requires new approaches to
managing complexity and its related risks. The electronics
industry addresses these challenges in a number of ways,
including the use of new EDA tools, the upgrade of design
methodologies, and offering integrated front-to-back design
solutions.

Cadence Electronic Design Automation
Tools

Cadence offers the most comprehensive set of EDA
tools in its industry. Cadence tools improve designer
productivity and design quality throughout the electronic design
process.

System-level Design Tools

Cadence system-level design tools help design
teams optimize their designs and provide a smooth path to
detailed hardware design. The Cadence Virtual Component
Co-design, or VCC, solution lets designers capture and
verify system behavior independent of hardware and software
implementation. Designers can then map the behavior to a variety
of architectural implementations and analyze the results of
each. Using this rapid exploration tool, teams can optimize
their overall system-level design including critical
hardware/software partitioning. VCC is also an ideal environment
for platform-based design. For those portions of the behavior
that are algorithmic in nature, the Cadence Signal Processing
Worksystem solution provides a specialized environment for
capturing and analyzing floating-point and fixed-point
algorithms. It also serves as a system-level testbench
environment, especially for communications and multimedia
applications.

Functional and System-level Verification
Tools

Design teams need a range of simulation and
hardware-based acceleration tools to verify the functionality of
their designs. Cadence offers a comprehensive set of simulators
and emulators for behavioral, register-transfer-level and
gate-level functional verification. Cadence’s digital
simulators include the NC-Verilog® simulator for the
Verilog® language, NC-VHDL for the VHDL® language and
NC-Sim, which simultaneously supports both languages. These
simulators provide designers with the simulation performance and
capacity they need to verify the functionality of complex
designs. The Cadence Verification Cockpit provides an
environment for creating testbenches, analyzing results and
debugging designs at a transaction level. Cadence also provides
standards-based transaction verification models for use in this
environment.

For design teams that need to accelerate
simulations and/or verify designs at the system-level, the
Cadence Quickturn® division offers acceleration and
emulation solutions. Palladium

TM

and CoBALT Ultra
Design Verification Systems are built with 0.12 micron,
custom silicon technology and are used for both simulation
acceleration and in-circuit emulation. Mercury

TM

Plus
utilizes custom field programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs, and is
used specifically for in-circuit emulation. Cadence also offers
application-specific solutions that provide a complete
verification environment for key applications such as
3G wireless communication, Packet over SONET networking,
and other popular applications. The use of Quickturn solutions
enables design teams to identify hardware and software problems
that they would otherwise not find until the design is
implemented in silicon.



Automated Digital IC Design Tools

Cadence’s unified synthesis/place-and-route
system, or SP&R, provides a complete implementation path
from register-transfer level, or RTL, through final layout for
the most advanced designs. The SP&R system consists of
Physically Knowledgeable Synthesis, or PKS, physical synthesis
for front-end logic design and Silicon Ensemble® PKS, or
SE-PKS optimization-place-and-route for back-end physical
design. PKS provides simultaneous logic synthesis,
placement and global routing. Silicon Ensemble-PKS provides a
complete place-and-route environment, including the ability to
re-optimize a design’s logic to meet new physical
constraints. These tools have common timing, optimization,
placement and routing engines to ensure single-pass accuracy as
the design progresses from RTL to final layout. The SP&R
flow supports power optimization, test synthesis and datapath
compilation capabilities for automated digital design. With the
CadMOS

TM

suite of tools, Cadence now also offers an
enhanced solution for signal integrity problems — such
as crosstalk — that become more prevalent and critical
at 0.13 micron and below designs. For leading-edge physical
verification, Cadence offers the Assura

TM

physical
verification toolset created specifically for deep submicron
designs.

In December 2001, Cadence acquired Silicon
Perspective Corporation, which produces the First
Encounter® full-chip virtual prototyping solution. Design
teams use the First Encounter solution to plan the physical
implementation of large, hierarchical designs.

Custom and Analog Design Tools

Cadence offers a comprehensive line of analog and
mixed-signal design tools. Cadence Analog Design Environment is
a front-to-back analog design automation solution for
full-custom analog, digital mixed-signal and radio frequency,
or RF, integrated circuit design. Within that environment,
designers can use the Cadence Spectre® Circuit Simulator.
RF designers can use the Cadence Spectre RF simulator
on desktop workstations to perform full-chip, transistor-level
circuit simulation of RF designs with 5,000+ devices.

The Cadence Virtuoso® suite of custom
IC layout tools provides a comprehensive set of layout
capabilities including layout editing, placement, routing and
physical verification for analog, custom digital mixed signal
and RF ICs. Virtuoso Custom IC Layout includes
correct-by-construction, connectivity-driven automation that
dramatically boosts designer productivity over manual
custom-layout techniques. Virtuoso Custom IC Layout is
integrated with the Cadence Assura physical verification
toolset, which offers automated, interactive physical and batch
IC layout verification, extraction and layout enhancements
for manufacturing. The Assura tool utilizes hierarchical
processing techniques to significantly reduce verification cycle
times and provide effective debugging capabilities.

For years, analog/mixed-signal design teams have
been seeking to move to a top-down approach. Cadence
AMS Designer enables them to do so. It is a mixed-signal
environment and analog/mixed-signal simulator, the latter of
which is based on the Cadence NC-Sim and Spectre simulators.

Printed Circuit Board Design Tools

Cadence offers a range of integrated PCB design
solutions for both individual and team-based environments. For
teams creating leading edge designs, Cadence provides a full
front-to-back flow. Products include Allegro®,
PCB layout, Concept® HDL schematic capture,
PCB librarian expert, SPECCTRA® autorouter and
SPECCTRAQuest

TM

for design and analysis of high-speed
digital systems. Recent product introductions focus on the
challenges of integrating high-speed ICs into a board system. A
new constraint management system targets the problem of
escalating electrical constraints by allowing engineers to
capture, manage and validate high-speed design rules at all
stages of the design cycle. Advances in signal integrity and
power delivery technologies enable engineers to analyze the
interconnect from silicon to package to board.

For individual productivity in the Windows-based
PCB design market, Cadence offers the OrCAD® product line
of integrated tools. Products include OrCAD Capture®
schematic entry, PSpice® analog and mixed signal simulator
and OrCAD Layout®.



For IC packaging design, the Cadence Advanced
Package Designer and Advanced Package Engineer environments
integrate electrical analysis and physical design through all
phases of development, bridging the gaps between IC design,
package design and package analysis.

Third-Party Tool and Partner Support

Cadence supports the integration of third-party
design tools through its Connections® Program. The
Connections Program provides other EDA companies with access to
Cadence products to ensure that Cadence tools work well in any
design environment. To date, more than 130 companies have
integrated their tools with Cadence software. Additionally,
Cadence manages relationships with foundry and library provider
partners to support customer-owned tooling, or COT, solutions
for its customers. Cadence also assists and supports library
providers in the integration of Cadence design and verification
tools and model formats into COT library solutions.

Electronic Design Automation
Services

To complement its tools, Cadence provides a range
of electronic design services that help optimize design team
productivity. These include educational, support, design,
verification, application service provider, or ASP, and
methodology services. Cadence’s educational services
include Internet, classroom and custom courses, the content of
which ranges from how to use the most recent tool features to
the latest design techniques. Support services include product
maintenance and updates, and telephone and Internet-based
technical support. Cadence also offers custom support services,
which may include one or more of its standard support services
plus account technical management, application and educational
services and metrics reporting. Maintenance and support
agreements are offered to customers either as part of Cadence
product license agreement or under a separate maintenance
agreement.

Design Services (Tality)

In 2000, Cadence separated its electronics design
services group into a new company named Tality Corporation.
Tality filed a registration statement with the Securities and
Exchange Commission for Tality’s initial public offering,
or IPO. Tality’s separation from Cadence was substantially
completed on October 4, 2000, and the electronic design
services business operated as a subsidiary of Cadence. In April
2001, Cadence announced the withdrawal of the Tality IPO
registration statement. Tality was reorganized during the
second, third and fourth quarters of 2001, and is currently a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Cadence.

Tality’s engineering services and
intellectual property are used for the design of complex
electronic systems and integrated circuits. Tality focuses its
offerings primarily on the communications market. Targeted
segments of this market include wireline and wireless
communications infrastructure and consumer communications
products. The engineering services extend from product concept
through manufacturing to help communications companies implement
their product plans. Tality’s business has been adversely
affected by the general slowdown in the economy and the
electronics industry specifically. See “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of
Operations.”

Verification and ASP Services

Cadence’s Quickturn division offers
verification and ASP services through TtME® (Time-to-Market
Engineering) services and the QuickCycles

TM

programs.
The TtME staff provides customers with consulting services,
project services and/or complete turnkey services.
QuickCycles

TM

allows customers to access Quickturn
verification systems on a pay-as-you-go basis, either on the
customer site or remotely over a high-speed, secure network
connection.

Methodology Services

Cadence’s Methodology Services group offers
a variety of services to help customers address electronic
design challenges. It leverages Cadence’s cumulative
experience and knowledge of design practices to improve
productivity. Cadence has begun offering virtual computer aided
design, known as VCAD, through which



engineering teams at one or more Cadence
locations provide technical support through a virtual private
network to customer design groups located at the customers’
design sites.

Marketing and Sales

Cadence generally uses a direct sales force
consisting of sales people and applications engineers to license
its products and market its consulting and design services to
prospective customers. Applications engineers provide technical
pre-sales as well as post-sales support for software products.
The Cadence Methodology Services group provides on-site
capabilities to help customers improve productivity with Cadence
and other EDA products. Due to the complexity of EDA products
and the electronic design process in general, the sales cycle is
generally long (three to six months or more). During the sales
cycle, the Cadence direct sales force generally provides
technical presentations, product demonstrations and on-site
customer evaluations of Cadence software. Cadence also uses
traditional marketing approaches to promote its products and
services, including advertising, direct mail, telemarketing,
trade shows, public relations and the Internet.

Cadence markets and supports its products and
services internationally through its subsidiaries and various
distributors. Cadence markets its emulation hardware and
consulting and design services in Japan through a wholly-owned
subsidiary. Since the reorganization of Cadence’s
distribution channel in Japan in 1997, Cadence has licensed its
software products through Innotech Corporation, in which Cadence
is an approximately 15% stockholder as of December 29, 2001.

Research and Development

Cadence’s investment in research and
development was $327.5 million in 2001, $292.4 million
in 2000, and $244.9 million in 1999, prior to capitalizing
software development costs of $30.2 million,
$28.4 million, and $25.7 million, respectively. See
“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a
more complete description of Cadence’s capitalization of
certain software development costs.

The primary areas of Cadence’s research
include SoC design, the design of silicon devices in the deep
submicron range, high-speed board design, architectural-level
design, high-performance logic verification technology and
hardware/ software co-design.

Cadence’s advanced research and development
group, Cadence Laboratories, is focused on new technology. This
group is chartered with identifying and developing prototype
technologies in emerging design areas that will offer
substantially improved alternatives to current EDA solutions.

Competition

In the EDA products industry, Cadence currently
competes with three large companies: Avant! Corporation, Mentor
Graphics Corporation and Synopsys, Inc. In December 2001, Avant!
and Synopsys announced their intention to merge, and if this
merger is completed, the combined company could improve its
competitive position with respect to Cadence. Cadence also
competes with numerous smaller companies, a number of which have
become publicly-traded companies or have combined with other EDA
companies. Cadence also competes with manufacturers of
electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to
internally develop their own EDA products. Many manufacturers of
electronic devices may be reluctant to purchase services from
independent vendors such as Cadence because they wish to promote
their own internal design departments. In the electronics design
and methodology services industries, Cadence competes with
numerous electronic design and consulting companies as well as
with the internal design capabilities of electronics
manufacturers. Other electronics companies and management
consulting firms continue to enter the electronics design and
methodology services industries.

The EDA product market and the commercial
electronic design and methodology services industries are highly
competitive. If Cadence were unable to compete successfully in
these industries, it could seriously harm Cadence’s
business, operating results and financial condition. To compete
in these industries, Cadence must identify and develop
innovative and cost-competitive EDA products and market them in
a timely manner. It must also gain industry acceptance for its
design and methodology services and offer better strategic
concepts,



technical solutions, prices and response time, or
a combination of these benefits, than those of other design
companies and the internal design departments of electronics
manufacturers. Cadence cannot assure you that it will be able to
compete successfully in these industries.

Proprietary Technology

Cadence’s success depends, in part, upon its
proprietary technology. Cadence generally relies on patents,
copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, licenses and
restrictive agreements to establish and protect its proprietary
rights in technology and products. Despite precautions Cadence
may take to protect its intellectual property, Cadence cannot
assure you that third parties will not try to challenge,
invalidate or circumvent these safeguards. Cadence also cannot
assure you that the rights granted under its patents will
provide it with any competitive advantages, patents will be
issued on any of its pending applications, or future patents
will be sufficiently broad to protect Cadence’s technology.
Furthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect
Cadence’s proprietary rights in those countries to the same
extent as U.S. law protects these rights in the United States.
Many Cadence products include software or other intellectual
property licensed from third parties. Cadence may have to seek
new or renew existing licenses for such software and other
intellectual property in the future. The Cadence design services
business also requires it to license the software or other
intellectual property of third parties, including that of
competitors. Cadence’s failure to obtain for its use
software or other intellectual property licenses or other
intellectual property rights on favorable terms, or the need to
engage in litigation over these licenses or rights, could
seriously harm Cadence’s business, operating results and
financial condition.

Manufacturing and Distribution

Cadence software production operations consist of
configuring the proper version of a product, outsourcing the
recording of the product on magnetic tape or CD-ROM, and
producing customer-unique access keys allowing customers to use
licensed products. Software and documentation are generally made
available to customers electronically by secured electronic
delivery, and to selected customers by electronic distribution
over the Internet. User manuals and other documentation are
generally available on CD-ROM, but are occasionally supplied in
hard copy format.

Cadence performs final assembly and test of its
hardware emulation products in San Jose, California.
Subcontractors manufacture all major subassemblies, including
all individual printed circuit boards and custom integrated
circuits, and supply them to Cadence for qualification and
testing prior to their incorporation into the assembled product.

Employees

As of March 2, 2002, Cadence employed
approximately 5,600 persons, with approximately 2,975 in
sales, services, marketing, support and manufacturing
activities, 1,800 in product development and 825 in management,
administration and finance. None of Cadence’s employees is
represented by a labor union, and Cadence has experienced no
work stoppages. Cadence believes that its employee relations are
good.

Factors That May Affect Future
Results

The following risk factors and other information
included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be
carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described
below are not the only ones Cadence faces. Additional risks and
uncertainties not currently known to Cadence or that Cadence
currently deems immaterial also may impair Cadence’s
business operations. If any of the following risks actually
occurs, Cadence’s business, operating results and financial
condition could be materially harmed. Unless specifically noted,
references to Cadence in the discussion below are references to
Cadence and its subsidiaries.



Cadence is subject to the cyclical nature
of the integrated circuit and electronics systems industries,
and

the current
downturn or any future downturns may reduce Cadence
revenue

Purchases of Cadence’s products and services
are highly dependent upon the commencement of new design
projects by integrated circuit manufacturers and electronics
systems companies. The integrated circuit industry is highly
cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid
technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price
erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and wide
fluctuations in product supply and demand. The integrated
circuit and electronics systems industries have experienced
significant downturns, often connected with, or in anticipation
of, maturing product cycles of both these companies’ and
their customers’ products and a decline in general economic
conditions. These downturns have been characterized by
diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high
inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling
prices. During these downturns, the number of new design
projects may decrease. Certain integrated circuit manufacturers
and electronics systems companies announced a slowdown of demand
and production in 2001 which has continued in 2002. Services and
hardware revenue is expected to continue to be adversely
affected by the general slowdown in the economy and in the
electronics industry specifically. The current slowdown and any
future downturns may reduce Cadence’s software and
maintenance revenue and further reduce its services and hardware
revenue and harm its results of operations.

Fluctuations in quarterly results of
operations could hurt Cadence’s business and the market
price of its

stock

Cadence has experienced, and may continue to
experience, varied quarterly operating results. Various factors
affect Cadence’s quarterly operating results and some of
them are not entirely within Cadence’s control, including
the timing of significant orders and the mix of licenses used to
sell products. See “Management Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operation —
Critical Accounting Policies.” Cadence’s quarterly
operating results are affected by the timing of significant
orders for its software products because a significant number of
contracts for software products are in excess of
$5.0 million. The failure to close a contract for the sale
of one or more orders of Cadence’s software products could
seriously harm its quarterly operating results.

Cadence’s quarterly operating results are
affected by the mix of license types entered into in connection
with the sale of software products. Cadence has three basic
licensing models: term, subscription and perpetual. Term and
perpetual licenses generally recognize the revenue for such
licenses at the beginning of the license period, while
subscription licenses recognize revenue ratably over the term of
the license. In the fourth quarter of 2001, Cadence’s mix
of software license types based on total contract value was
approximately 50% term licenses, 40% subscription licenses
and 10% perpetual licenses. Should different conditions prevail
so that the mix of Cadence’s license types were to change
to a higher proportion of subscription licenses, Cadence’s
software license revenue in that period would decline because a
greater portion of revenue would be recognized over time. That
decline could have a material impact on the results of
operations in the quarter of the change in mix.

Sales of Cadence’s hardware products depend,
in significant part, upon the decision of the prospective
customer to commence a project for the design and development of
complex integrated circuits and systems. These projects often
require significant commitments of time and capital.
Cadence’s hardware sales may be delayed if customers delay
commencement of projects. Lengthy hardware sales cycles subject
Cadence to a number of significant risks over which Cadence has
little or no control, including insufficient, excess or obsolete
inventory, variations in inventory valuation and fluctuations in
quarterly operating results.

In addition, Cadence bases its expense budgets
partially on its expectations of future revenue. However, it is
difficult to predict revenue levels or growth. Revenue levels
that are below Cadence’s expectations could seriously hurt
Cadence’s business, operating results and financial
condition. Also, because of the timing of large orders and its
customers’ buying patterns, Cadence may not learn of
revenue shortfalls, earnings shortfalls or other failures to
meet market expectations until late in a fiscal quarter, which
could cause even more immediate and serious harm to the trading
price of Cadence common stock. Many of Cadence’s services
engagements are terminable with little or no advance notice and
without penalty. Since a significant portion of



the costs of services is labor-related, Cadence
may not be able to reduce its costs in a timely manner to
respond to an unanticipated revenue loss when one or more
projects are terminated.

Cadence believes that quarter-to-quarter
comparisons of its results of operations may not be meaningful.
Therefore, stockholders should not view Cadence’s
historical results of operations as reliable indicators of its
future performance. If revenue or operating results fall short
of the levels expected by public market analysts and investors,
the trading price of Cadence common stock could decline
dramatically.

The lengthy sales cycle of Cadence’s
products and services makes the timing of its revenue difficult
to

predict and may cause its operating results
	to fluctuate unexpectedly

Cadence has a lengthy sales cycle that generally
extends at least three to six months. The length of the sales
cycle may cause Cadence’s revenue and operating results to
vary unexpectedly from quarter to quarter. The complexity and
expense associated with Cadence’s business generally
requires a lengthy customer education and approval process.
Consequently, Cadence may incur substantial expenses and devote
significant management effort and expense to develop potential
relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and
may prevent Cadence from pursuing other opportunities.

In addition, sales of Cadence products and
services may be delayed if customers delay approval or
commencement of projects because of:

•

Customers’ budgetary constraints and
	internal acceptance review procedures;

•

The timing of customers’ budget cycles; or

•

The timing of customers’ competitive
	evaluation processes.

If customers experience delays in their approval
or project commencement activities, Cadence may not learn of,
and therefore be able to communicate to the public, revenue or
earnings shortfalls until late in a fiscal quarter.

Cadence’s failure to respond quickly
to technological developments could make its products
uncompetitive

and obsolete

The industries in which Cadence competes
experience rapid technology developments, changes in industry
standards, changes in customer requirements and frequent new
product introductions and improvements. Currently, the
electronic IC design industry is experiencing several
revolutionary trends:

•

Migration to Deep SubMicron: The size of features
	such as wires, transistors and contacts on ICs is shrinking due
	to advances in semiconductor manufacturing processes. Process
	feature sizes refer to the width of the transistors and the
	width and spacing of the interconnect on the IC. Feature size is
	normally identified by the headline transistor length, which is
	shrinking from 0.25 microns to 0.13 microns and
	smaller. This is commonly referred to in the semiconductor
	industry as the migration to deep submicron. It represents a
	major challenge for all levels of the semiconductor industry,
	from IC design and design automation to design of
	manufacturing equipment and the manufacturing process itself.
	Shrinkage of transistor length to such infinitesimal proportions
	(for reference, the diameter of the period at the end of this
	sentence is approximately 400 microns) is challenging
	fundamental laws of physics and chemistry.

•

The ability to design very large ICs, in
	particular integration of entire electronic systems onto a
	single chip instead of a circuit board (a process that is
	referred to in the industry as “SoC”), increases the
	complexity of managing a design that at the lowest level is
	represented by billions of shapes on the fabrication mask. In
	addition, systems typically incorporate microprocessors and
	digital signal processors that are programmed with software,
	requiring simultaneous design of the silicon chip and the
	related embedded software on the chip.

If Cadence is unable to respond quickly and
successfully to these developments and the evolution of these
changes, Cadence may lose its competitive position and its
products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete.
To compete successfully, Cadence must develop or acquire new
products and improve its existing products and processes on a
schedule that keeps pace with technological developments in its



industries. Cadence must also be able to support
a range of changing computer software, hardware platforms and
customer preferences. There is no guarantee that Cadence will be
successful in this respect.

Cadence has historically suffered losses in
its electronics design services business

The market for electronics design services is
relatively new, rapidly evolving and sensitive to customer
budgetary constraints and engineering capacity. Tality has
historically suffered losses, and it incurred significant
expenses in connection with its separation. If Tality fails to
increase its revenue to offset its expenses, Tality will
continue to experience losses. Tality’s failure to succeed
in the design services business may seriously harm
Cadence’s business, operating results and financial
condition.

The success of Cadence’s services
businesses depend on factors that are difficult to
control

In order to be successful with its services,
Cadence must overcome several factors that are difficult to
control, including the following:

•

Cadence’s cost of services personnel is
	high and reduces gross margin.

Gross
	margin represents the difference between the amount of revenue
	from the sale of services and Cadence’s cost of providing
	those services. Cadence must pay high salaries to attract and
	retain professional services personnel. This results in a lower
	gross margin than the gross margin in Cadence’s software
	business. In addition, the high cost of training new services
	personnel or not fully utilizing these personnel can
	significantly lower gross margin, and it is difficult to adjust
	staffing levels quickly to reflect customer demand for services.

•

A substantial portion of these services
	contracts is fixed-price contracts.

This means that the customer pays a
	fixed price that has been agreed upon ahead of time, no matter
	how much time or how many resources Cadence must devote to
	perform the contract. If Cadence’s cost in performing the
	services consistently and significantly exceeds the amount the
	customer has agreed to pay, it could seriously harm
	Cadence’s business, operating results and financial
	condition.

Cadence’s inability to compete in its
industries could seriously harm its business

The EDA market and the commercial electronics
design and methodology services industries are highly
competitive. If Cadence were unable to compete successfully in
these industries, it could seriously harm Cadence’s
business, operating results and financial condition. To compete
in these industries, Cadence must identify and develop
innovative and cost competitive EDA software products and
market them in a timely manner. It must also gain industry
acceptance for its design and methodology services and offer
better strategic concepts, technical solutions, prices and
response time, or a combination of these factors, than those of
other design companies and the internal design departments of
electronics manufacturers. Cadence cannot assure you that it
will be able to compete successfully in these industries.
Factors that could affect Cadence’s ability to succeed
include:

•

The development of competitive EDA products and
	design and methodology services could result in a shift of
	customer preferences away from Cadence’s products and
	services and significantly decrease revenue;

•

The electronics design and methodology services
	industries are relatively new and electronics design companies
	and manufacturers are only beginning to purchase these services
	from outside vendors;

•

Due to budgeting constraints or excess
	engineering capacity, electronics manufacturers often choose to
	perform design and methodology services internally, rather than
	purchase these services from outside vendors;

•

The pace of technology change demands continuous
	technological development to meet the requirements of
	next-generation design challenges; and

•

There are a significant number of current and
	potential competitors in the EDA industry and the cost of entry
	is low.



In the EDA products industry, Cadence currently
competes with three large companies: Avant! Corporation, Mentor
Graphics Corporation, and Synopsys, Inc. In December 2001,
Synopsys and Avant! announced their intention to merge, and if
this merger is completed, the combined company could improve its
competitive position with respect to Cadence. Cadence also
competes with numerous smaller companies, a number of which have
become publicly-traded companies or have combined with other EDA
companies. Cadence also competes with manufacturers of
electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to
develop their own EDA products. Many manufacturers of electronic
devices may be reluctant to purchase services from independent
vendors such as Cadence because they wish to promote their own
internal design departments. In the electronics design and
methodology services industries, Cadence competes with numerous
electronic design and consulting companies as well as with the
internal design capabilities of electronics manufacturers. Other
electronics companies and management consulting firms continue
to enter the electronic design and methodology services
industries.

Cadence’s failure to obtain software
	or other intellectual property licenses or adequately protect
	its

proprietary
rights could seriously harm its business

Cadence’s success depends, in part, upon its
proprietary technology. Many of Cadence’s products include
software or other intellectual property licensed from third
parties, and Cadence may have to seek new or renew existing
licenses for software and other intellectual property in the
future. Cadence’s design services business also requires it
to license software or other intellectual property of third
parties, including that of competitors. Cadence’s failure
to obtain for its use software or other intellectual property
licenses or other intellectual property rights on favorable
terms, or the need to engage in litigation over these licenses
or rights, could seriously harm Cadence’s business,
operating results and financial condition.

Also, Cadence generally relies on patents,
copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, licenses and
restrictive agreements to establish and protect its proprietary
rights in technology and products. Despite precautions Cadence
may take to protect its intellectual property, Cadence cannot
assure you that third parties will not try to challenge,
invalidate, or circumvent these safeguards. Cadence also cannot
assure you that the rights granted under its patents will
provide it with any competitive advantages, patents will be
issued on any of its pending applications, or future patents
will be sufficiently broad to protect Cadence’s technology.
Furthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect
Cadence’s proprietary rights in those countries to the same
extent as U.S. law protects these rights in the United States.

Cadence cannot assure you that its reliance on
licenses from or to or restrictive agreements with third
parties, or that patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret
protections, will be enough to be successful and profitable in
the industries in which Cadence competes.

Intellectual property infringement by or
	against Cadence could seriously harm its business

There are numerous patents in the EDA industry
and new patents are being issued at a rapid rate. It is not
always economically practicable to determine in advance whether
a product or any of its components infringes the patent rights
of others. As a result, from time to time, Cadence may be forced
to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement
claims to protect its rights or defend a customer’s rights.
These claims, regardless of merit, could consume valuable
management time, result in costly litigation, or cause product
shipment delays, all of which could seriously harm
Cadence’s business, operating results and financial
condition. In settling these claims, Cadence may be required to
enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third
parties claiming infringement. These royalty or licensing
agreements, if available, may not have terms acceptable to
Cadence. Being forced to enter into a license agreement with
unfavorable terms could seriously harm Cadence’s business,
operating results and financial condition. Any potential
intellectual property litigation could force Cadence to do one
or more of the following:

•

Pay damages to the party claiming infringement;

•

Stop licensing, or providing services that use,
	the challenged intellectual property;

•

Obtain a license from the owner of the infringed
	intellectual property to sell or use the relevant technology,
	which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at
	all; or

•

Redesign the challenged technology, which could
	be time-consuming and costly.



If Cadence were forced to take any of these
actions, Cadence’s business and results of operations may
be harmed.

Cadence obtains key components for its
	hardware products from a limited number of
	suppliers

Cadence depends on several suppliers for certain
key components and board assemblies used in its hardware-based
verification products. Cadence’s inability to develop
alternative sources or to obtain sufficient quantities of these
components or board assemblies could result in delays or
reductions in product shipments. In particular, Cadence
currently relies on IBM for the hardware components for
Cadence’s CoBALT

TM

, Mercury

TM

PLUS and
Palladium

TM

products. Other disruptions in supply may
also occur. If there were such a reduction or interruption,
Cadence’s results of operations would be seriously harmed.
Even if Cadence can eventually obtain these components from
alternative sources, a significant delay in Cadence’s
ability to deliver products would result.

Cadence expects to acquire other companies
	and may not successfully integrate them or the companies
	it

has
recently acquired

Cadence has acquired numerous other businesses
before and is likely to acquire other businesses in the future.
While Cadence expects to analyze carefully all potential
transactions before committing to them, Cadence cannot assure
you that any transaction that is completed will result in
long-term benefits to Cadence or its stockholders, or that
Cadence’s management will be able to manage the acquired
businesses effectively. In addition, growth through acquisition
involves a number of risks. If any of the following events
occurs after Cadence acquires another business, it could
seriously harm Cadence’s business, operating results and
financial condition:

•

Difficulties in combining previously separate
	businesses into a single unit;

•

The substantial diversion of management’s
	attention from day-to-day business when evaluating and
	negotiating these transactions and then integrating an acquired
	business;

•

The discovery after the acquisition has been
	completed of liabilities assumed from the acquired business;

•

The failure to realize anticipated benefits such
	as cost savings and revenue enhancements;

•

The failure to retain key personnel of the
	acquired business;

•

Difficulties related to assimilating the products
	of an acquired business in, for example, distribution,
	engineering and customer support areas;

•

Unanticipated costs;

•

Adverse effects on existing relationships with
	suppliers and customers; and

•

Failure to understand and compete effectively in
	markets in which Cadence has limited previous experience.

Cadence’s international operations may
	seriously harm its financial condition because of several
	weak

foreign
economies and the effect of foreign exchange rate
fluctuations

Cadence has significant operations outside the
United States. Cadence’s revenue from international
operations as a percentage of total revenue was approximately
45% for fiscal 2001 and 44% for fiscal 2000. Cadence also
transacts business in various foreign currencies. Recent
economic and political uncertainty and the volatility of foreign
currencies in certain parts of the Asia-Pacific region have had,
and may continue to have, a seriously harmful effect on
Cadence’s revenue and operating results.

Fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the
U.S. dollar and the currencies of other countries in which
Cadence conducts business could seriously harm its business,
operating results and financial condition. For example, if there
is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency exchanges
into U.S. dollars, it will take more of the foreign currency to
equal a specified amount of U.S. dollars than before the rate
increase. If Cadence prices its products and services in the
foreign currency, it will receive less in U.S. dollars than it
did before the rate increase went into effect. If Cadence prices
its products and services in U.S. dollars, an increase in the
exchange rate will result in an increase in the price for
Cadence’s products and services



compared to those products of its competitors
that are priced in local currency. This could result in
Cadence’s prices being uncompetitive in markets where
business is transacted in the local currency. Cadence’s
international operations may also be subject to other risks,
including:

•

The adoption and expansion of government trade
	restrictions;

•

Volatile foreign exchange rates and currency
	conversion risks;

•

Limitations on repatriation of earnings;

•

Reduced protection of intellectual property
	rights in some countries;

•

Recessions in foreign economies;

•

Longer receivables collection periods and greater
	difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;

•

Difficulties in managing foreign operations;

•

Political and economic instability;

•

Business interruptions from terrorism, military
	operations and war;

•

Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;

•

Tariffs and other trade barriers; and

•

U.S. government licensing requirements for
	exports which make licenses difficult to obtain.

Cadence expects that revenue from its
international operations will continue to account for a
significant portion of its total revenue.

Exposure to foreign currency transaction risk can
arise when transactions are conducted in a currency different
from the functional currency of a Cadence subsidiary. A
subsidiary’s functional currency is the currency in which
it primarily conducts its operations, including product pricing,
expenses and borrowings. Cadence uses foreign currency forward
exchange contracts and purchases foreign currency put options to
help protect against currency exchange risks. These forward
contracts and put options allow Cadence to buy or sell specific
foreign currencies at specific prices on specific dates.
Increases or decreases in the value of Cadence’s foreign
currency transactions are partially offset by gains and losses
on these forward contracts and put options. Although Cadence
attempts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations,
significant exchange rate movements may hurt Cadence’s
results of operations as expressed in U.S. dollars.

Foreign currency exchange risk occurs for some of
Cadence’s foreign operations whose functional currency is
the local currency. The primary effect of foreign currency
translation on Cadence’s results of operations is a
reduction in revenue from a strengthening U.S. dollar, offset by
a smaller reduction in expenses. Exchange rate gains and losses
on the translation into U.S. dollars of amounts denominated in
foreign currencies are included as a separate component of
stockholders’ equity.

Failure to obtain export licenses could
	harm Cadence’s business

Cadence must comply with U.S. Department of
Commerce regulations in shipping its software products and other
technologies outside the United States. Although Cadence has not
had any significant difficulty complying with these regulations
so far, any significant future difficulty in complying could
harm Cadence’s business, operating results and financial
condition.

Cadence’s failure to attract, train,
	motivate and retain key employees may harm its
	business

Competition for highly skilled employees is very
intense. Cadence’s business depends on the efforts and
abilities of its senior management, its research and development
staff, and a number of other key management, sales, support,
technical and services personnel. The high cost of training new
personnel, not fully utilizing these personnel, or losing
trained personnel to competing employers could reduce
Cadence’s gross margins and harm its business and operating
results. Competition for these personnel is intense,
particularly in geographic areas recognized as high technology
centers such as the Silicon Valley area, where Cadence’s
principal offices are located, and the other locations where it
maintains facilities. To attract and retain individuals with the
requisite expertise, Cadence may be required to grant large
numbers of stock options or other stock-based incentive awards,
which may be dilutive to existing stockholders. Cadence may also
be required to pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses,
which could harm its operating results. If Cadence does not
succeed in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate
qualifications, it will not be able to grow its business and its



operating results will suffer. Cadence’s
failure to attract, train, motivate and retain key employees
would impair its development of new products, its ability to
provide design and methodology services and the management of
its businesses. This would seriously harm Cadence’s
business, operating results and financial condition.

If Cadence becomes subject to unfair hiring
claims, Cadence could be prevented from hiring
needed

personnel,
incur liability for damages and incur substantial costs in
defending itself

Companies in Cadence’s industry whose
employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim
that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices
or that the employment of these persons would involve the
disclosure or use of trade secrets. These claims could prevent
Cadence from hiring personnel or cause it to incur liability for
damages. Cadence could also incur substantial costs in defending
itself or its employees against these claims, regardless of
their merits. Defending itself from these claims could also
divert the attention of Cadence’s management away from its
operations.

Errors or defects in Cadence’s
products and services could expose it to liability and harm its
reputation

Cadence’s customers use its products and
services in designing and developing products that involve a
high degree of technological complexity, each of which has its
own specifications. Because of the complexity of the systems and
products with which Cadence works, some of its products and
designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in
the marketplace. As a result, its customers or their end users
may discover errors or defects in Cadence’s software or the
systems Cadence designs, or the products or systems
incorporating its design and intellectual property may not
operate as expected. Errors or defects could result in:

•

Loss of current customers and loss of or delay in
	revenue and loss of market share;

•

Failure to attract new customers or achieve
	market acceptance;

•

Diversion of development resources to resolving
	the problem;

•

Increased service costs; and

•

Liability for damages.

Anti-takeover defenses in Cadence’s
charter, by-laws, and under Delaware law could prevent an
acquisition

of Cadence or
limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for
Cadence common stock

Provisions of the Delaware General Corporation
Law that apply to Cadence and its Certificate of Incorporation
could make it difficult for another company to acquire control
of Cadence. For example:

•

Section 203 of the Delaware General
	Corporation Law generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from
	engaging in any business combination with a person owning 15% or
	more of its voting stock, or who is affiliated with the
	corporation and owned 15% or more of its voting stock at any
	time within three years prior to the proposed business
	combination, for a period of three years from the date the
	person became a 15% owner, unless specified conditions are met.

•

Cadence’s Certificate of Incorporation
	allows Cadence’s Board of Directors to issue, at any time
	and without stockholder approval, preferred stock with such
	terms as it may determine. No shares of preferred stock are
	currently outstanding. However, the rights of holders of any
	Cadence preferred stock that may be issued in the future may be
	superior to the rights of holders of its common stock.

•

Cadence has a rights plan, commonly known as a
	“poison pill,” which would make it difficult for
	someone to acquire Cadence without the approval of
	Cadence’s Board of Directors.

All or any one of these factors could limit the
price that certain investors would be willing to pay for shares
of Cadence common stock and could delay, prevent or allow
Cadence’s Board of Directors to resist an acquisition of
Cadence, even if the proposed transaction was favored by a
majority of Cadence’s independent stockholders.



Item 2. Properties

Cadence’s headquarters are located in San
Jose, California, and Cadence owns the related land and
buildings. Additionally, Cadence owns buildings in India and
land and buildings in Scotland. The total square footage of
Cadence’s owned buildings is approximately
984,000 square feet.

Cadence leases additional facilities for its
sales offices in the United States and various foreign
countries, and its research and development and design services
facilities in the United States and in foreign countries
including the United Kingdom and India. Cadence subleases
certain of these facilities where space is not fully utilized or
has been involved in restructuring activities.

Cadence believes that these facilities and the
undeveloped land it owns adjacent to its current headquarters
are adequate for its current needs and that suitable additional
or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate
any expansion of Cadence’s operations.

Item 3. Legal
Proceedings

From time to time, Cadence is involved in various
disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary
course of business. These include disputes and lawsuits related
to intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, licensing,
contract law, distribution arrangements and employee relations
matters.

Cadence filed a complaint in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California
on December 6, 1995 against Avant! Corporation and certain
of its employees or agents for misappropriation of trade
secrets, copyright infringement, conspiracy and other illegal
acts involving intellectual property.

On January 16, 1996, Avant! filed various
counterclaims against Cadence and Joseph B. Costello,
Cadence’s former President and Chief Executive Officer, and
with leave of the court, on January 29, 1998, filed a
second amended counterclaim. The second amended counterclaim
alleges, inter alia, that Cadence and Mr. Costello had
cooperated with the Santa Clara County, California, District
Attorney and initiated and pursued its complaint against Avant!
for anti-competitive reasons, engaged in wrongful activity in an
attempt to manipulate Avant!’s stock price, and utilized
certain pricing policies and other acts to unfairly compete
against Avant! in the marketplace. The second amended
counterclaim also alleges that certain Cadence insiders engaged
in illegal insider trading with respect to Avant!’s stock.
Cadence and Mr. Costello believe that they have meritorious
defenses to Avant!’s claims, and each intends to defend
such action vigorously. By an order dated July 13, 1996,
the court bifurcated Avant!’s counterclaim from
Cadence’s complaint and stayed the counterclaim pending
resolution of Cadence’s complaint. The counterclaim remains
stayed.

In an order issued on December 19, 1997, as
modified on January 26, 1998, the District Court entered a
preliminary injunction barring Avant! from any further
infringement of Cadence’s copyrights in Design Framework
II® software, or selling, licensing or copying such product
derived from Design Framework II, including, but not
limited to, Avant!’s ArcCell products. On December 7,
1998, the District Court issued a further preliminary
injunction, which enjoined Avant! from selling its Aquarius
product line. Cadence posted a $10.0 million bond in
connection with the issuance of the preliminary injunction. On
July 30, 1999, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit affirmed the preliminary injunction.

On July 25, 2001, Avant! was ordered to pay
Cadence $194.6 million in criminal restitution after Avant!
entered a plea of no contest and was found guilty by the
Superior Court of the State of California of conspiracy to take
and use Cadence’s trade secrets. This conspiracy included
the theft by Avant! and certain individuals of Cadence
intellectual property, including software code, as well as other
trade secrets. As of December 29, 2001, approximately
$196.0 million, consisting of all of the restitution award
plus interest was received. This amount was recorded in
restructuring, asset impairment and unusual items in
Cadence’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.

On September 7, 1999, the District Court
ruled on the parties’ Motions for Summary Adjudication, and
granted in part, and denied in part, each party’s motion
regarding the scope of a June 6, 1994 Release Agreement
between the parties. The court held that Cadence’s
copyright infringement claim against Avant! is not barred by the
release and that Cadence may proceed on that claim. The court
also held that Cadence’s



trade secret claim based on Avant!’s use,
prior to June 1994, of Cadence’s Design Framework II
source code is barred by the release. On May 15, 2001, the
Ninth Circuit heard oral arguments by both parties on their
appeals from the District Court’s order. On June 11,
2001, the Ninth Circuit certified a question of California law
to the California Supreme Court and stayed the case. On
October 31, 2001, the California Supreme Court agreed to
accept such certification.

In February 1998, Aptix Corporation and Meta
Systems, Inc. filed a lawsuit against Quickturn Design Systems,
Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District
of California alleging that Quickturn infringed a
U.S. patent owned by Aptix and licensed to Meta. In June
2000, the District Court entered judgment in favor of Quickturn,
dismissing the complaint and declaring the patent unenforceable.
The Court also granted summary judgment to Aptix, denying
Quickturn’s abuse of process counterclaim. On
September 8, 2000 the Court ordered Aptix to pay
$4.2 million to Quickturn as reimbursement of
attorneys’ fees and costs it incurred in the litigation.
Aptix appealed the District’s Court’s judgment and
posted a $2.0 million bond to secure the judgment. On
June 8, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court’s dismissal of
Quickturn’s abuse of process counterclaim. On
November 5, 2001, the Federal Circuit vacated the District
Court’s judgment of unenforceability, but affirmed the
District Court’s dismissal of Aptix’s and Meta’s
complaint and the award of attorneys fees and costs.

On January 7, 1999, in a suit captioned
Mentor Graphics Corporation, et al. v. Lobo, et al., Delaware
Chancery Court, New Castle County, Civ. Action No. 16843-NC
(“Mentor II”), Mentor filed and served an amended
complaint asserting claims against Cadence, Quickturn and the
Quickturn Board of Directors for declaratory and injunctive
relief for various alleged breaches of fiduciary duty
purportedly owned by Quickturn and its Board of Directors to
Quickturn’s shareholders in connection with the merger
between Quickturn and Cadence. Mentor further alleged that
Cadence aided and abetted Quickturn and its Board of Directors
in those purported breaches. Mentor has not prosecuted the
matter since January 1999. In May 2000, Mentor advised the
Delaware Chancery Court of its objection to the settlement of a
companion action brought on behalf of certain Quickturn
shareholders, and sought an award of attorneys’ fees
related to its prosecution of Mentor II as well as the
prior related action, to which Cadence was not a party.
Settlement of the companion action is conditioned upon approval
of the Chancery Court and Mentor’s not being awarded
attorneys’ fee for Mentor II. In an order dated
August 17, 2001, the Chancery Court denied Mentor’s
fee application. Mentor has indicated that it will appeal this
order.

On July 21, 1999, Mentor filed suit against
Quickturn, which action is pending in the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of California, Civil Action
No. C 99-5464. Mentor has alleged that
Quickturn’s Mercury

TM

and
Mercury

TM

Plus hardware emulation systems infringe
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,777,489 and 5,790,832, allegedly
assigned to Mentor. At Quickturn’s request, Cadence was
added as a defendant. Quickturn and Cadence are vigorously
defending themselves against Mentor’s claims, and have
filed counterclaims for declaratory judgment of non-infringement
and invalidity of these patents.

On March 24, 2000, Mentor and Meta and
several founders of Meta filed suit against Quickturn and
Cadence and a former Quickturn employee in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California, Civil Action No. C-00-01030. The suit alleges
infringement of U.S. Patent No. 5,574,832 allegedly
assigned to Mentor, misappropriation of trade secrets and breach
of confidence, and seeks unspecified damages, injunctive relief
and the assignment to Mentor of a patent previously issued to
Quickturn. Quickturn and Cadence are vigorously defending
themselves against these claims, and have filed counterclaims
for declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity of
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,754,827, 5,999,725 and 6,057,706
allegedly assigned to Mentor.

On September 11, 2000, Mentor filed a
complaint against Quickturn and Cadence in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California, Civil Action No. C-00-03291, accusing Quickturn
and Cadence of infringing U.S. Patent No. 5,574,388,
purportedly owned by Mentor, and seeking unspecified damages and
injunctive relief. Cadence and Quickturn are vigorously
defending themselves against Mentor’s claim, and have filed
counterclaims for declaratory judgment of non-infringement of
this patent. The parties have agreed to consolidate this action
with Civil Action Nos. C 99-5464 and C 00-01030,
described above, for purposes of discovery and pre-trial
motions. A trial date has been set for October 7, 2002.
Meanwhile, on November 3,



2000, Mentor filed a motion for preliminary
injunction, asking the Court to prohibit the sale of
Quickturn’s MercuryPlus emulation systems prior to trial of
this action. The Court denied the motion for preliminary
injunction on August 30, 2001, stating that Quickturn and
Cadence had raised substantial questions regarding the validity
of U.S. Patent No. 5,574,388. However, the Court also
stated that Mentor had demonstrated likelihood of success in
proving that Quickturn’s MercuryPlus emulation systems
infringe Claims 1 and 5 of the patent. Mentor subsequently
filed a motion for summary judgment that Quickturn’s
MercuryPlus

TM

emulation system infringes
Claims 1 and 5 of U.S. Patent No. 5,574,388.
Mentor’s summary judgment motion will be heard on
March 22, 2002. Quickturn and Cadence believe the Court
will ultimately conclude that no such infringement exists.

On November 2, 2000, Mentor and Meta filed a
complaint for declaratory judgment against Quickturn and Cadence
in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon (Case
No. C-00-1489) seeking a ruling that Mentor’s proposed
design verification approach (in which IC designers would use
U.S.-based computer terminals to operate SimExpress emulation
systems located overseas) will not infringe Quickturn’s
patents and will not violate the permanent injunction entered by
the Oregon District Court on July 7, 1999 in Civil Action
No. C-96-00342. In January 2001, Quickturn and Cadence
filed a Motion to Dismiss the action, based on lack of subject
matter jurisdiction. On May 1, 2001, the Court
provisionally granted Quickturn’s motion to dismiss.
Cadence and Quickturn believe that Mentor’s complaint is
without merit.

On April 30, 1999, Cadence and several of
its officers and directors were named as defendants in a lawsuit
filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California, entitled Spett v. Cadence Design Systems, et al.,
civil action no. C 99-2082. The action was brought on behalf of
a class of stockholders who purchased Cadence common stock
between November 4, 1998 and April 20, 1999, and
alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On September 18, 2000, the
District Court granted Cadence’s Motion to Dismiss
Plaintiffs’ Claims with leave to amend. Plantiffs did not
amend their complaint, and on November 29, 2001 an order
was filed dismissing the claims with prejudice and granting
judgment in favor of Cadence and the individual defendants.

On February 25, 2000, Cadence and several of
its officers were named as defendants in a lawsuit filed in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California,
entitled Maxick v. Cadence Design Systems, Inc., File No. C
00-0658PJH. The action was brought on behalf of a class of
shareholders of OrCAD, Inc., and alleges violations of
Section 14(d)(7) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
and Rule 14d-10 thereunder. The lawsuit arose out of
Cadence’s acquisition of OrCAD, which was completed in
August 1999. The parties have settled the matter for the payment
of $1.25 million by Cadence. The settlement is subject to
court approval.

In early 1999, Cadence entered into negotiations
with Intelect Communications, Inc. (since renamed TeraForce
Technology Corporation), and Intelect’s wholly-owned
subsidiary, DNA Enterprises, Inc., with respect to a potential
purchase of substantially all the assets of DNA. The transaction
was not consummated and, in July 1999, Intelect and DNA filed
suit against Cadence in a Texas state court alleging breach of
contract, fraud, negligent misrepresentation and breach of
fiduciary duty, seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive
damages. Cadence has answered, denying liability. In January
2002, the court denied Cadence’s Motion for Partial Summary
Judgment and set a trial for March 2002.

On November 22, 2000, a former design
services customer, Uniden Corporation, filed an action for
fraud, negligent misrepresentation and breach of contract in the
State Court of Texas against Cadence and other corporate
defendants, seeking compensatory and punitive damages in an
unspecified amount. The suit was filed after Cadence demanded
payment of approximately $1.0 million for design services
rendered to Uniden. Cadence since has filed a counterclaim to
recover the approximately $1.0 million owed for services
rendered. The parties agreed to dismiss voluntarily the actions
pending in the State Court of Texas and to re-file in the State
Court of California, County of Orange. Uniden refiled its
complaint on July 2, 2001 in Orange County, California.
Cadence filed its answer and counterclaim on September 12,
2001.

On December 28, 2000, a former design
services customer, Scanz Communications, Inc. and Scanz
Communications, LLC (“Scanz”) filed an action for
various causes of action in the Los Angeles Superior Court of
California against Cadence and Tality Corporation and Tality,
LP, seeking compensatory and



punitive damages in an unspecified amount. The
suit was filed after Cadence demanded payment of $4,657,556.17
for design services rendered to Scanz. Scanz filed a first
amended complaint on April 2, 2001. Following demurrers by
Cadence that were sustained in part, Scanz filed a second
amended complaint on July 10, 2001 to which Cadence and
Tality filed their answer on October 10, 2001. Scanz’s
remaining causes of action are fraud, breach of contract,
intentional interference with contract, unfair business
practices and negligent misrepresentation, for which Scanz seeks
damages in the “tens of millions of dollars”.

On June 7, 2001, Cadence, Tality Corporation
and Tality, LP filed a cross-complaint against Scanz alleging
breach of contract and unjust enrichment, and seeking
declaratory relief. On July 12, 2001, Scanz filed an answer
to Cadence’s cross-complaint denying all allegations. Trial
in this matter is scheduled for September 23, 2002. Cadence
intends to vigorously defend the claims alleged by Scanz.

Management believes that the ultimate resolution
of the disputes and litigation matters discussed above will not
have a material adverse effect on Cadence’s business,
operating results or financial condition. However, were an
unfavorable ruling to occur in any specific period, there exists
the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of
operations for such period.

Overview

General

Cadence provides comprehensive software and other
technology and offers design and methodology services for the
product development requirements of the world’s leading
electronics companies. Cadence licenses its leading-edge EDA
software and hardware technology and provides a range of
services to its customers throughout the world to help them
optimize their product development processes. Cadence’s
products and services are used by companies to design and
develop complex integrated circuits and electronic systems,
including semiconductors, computer systems and peripherals,
telecommunications and networking equipment, mobile and wireless
devices, automotive electronics, consumer products and other
advanced electronics

In late 2000, both the U.S. economy in general
and the electronics industry in particular began to experience a
slowdown, the severity of which increased during 2001. This
economic slowdown adversely affected the electronics industry,
and in particular, negatively affected Cadence sales of design
services through Tality and sales of hardware emulation
products. The electronics industry slowdown, especially in the
semiconductor industry, could potentially reduce Cadence’s
revenue and harm its results of operations throughout 2002.

Acquisitions

Cadence has acquired numerous businesses and is
likely to do so in the future. These acquisitions are described
in more detail in “In-Process Technology” and in the
notes to Cadence’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2001, Cadence acquired Silicon
Perspective®Corporation, or SPC, a privately-held design
technology firm, for approximately 6.8 million shares of
Cadence common stock, valued at $132.5 million. SPC
provides electronic design tools that bridge the gap between
front-end logic designers and the back-end physical design
process. The purchase price could increase if certain
predetermined performance goals are achieved in fiscal 2002 and
2003.

In February 2001, Cadence acquired CadMOS Design
Technology, Inc., a privately-held design tools firm, for
approximately 3.6 million shares of Cadence common stock,
valued at $92.7 million. The acquisition was accounted for
as a purchase. CadMOS provides solutions to the noise problems
experienced in ultra-deep submicron processes. The purchase
price will increase up to an additional 488,970 shares if
certain predetermined performance goals are achieved over the
three years following the acquisition.

Tality
Separation

On July 17, 2000, Cadence announced its plan
to separate its electronics design services group into a new
company named Tality Corporation. Tality filed a registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for
Tality’s IPO. Tality’s separation from Cadence was
substantially completed on October 4, 2000, and the
electronic design services business thereafter operated as a
subsidiary of Cadence. As a result of the separation in the
third quarter of 2000, Cadence recorded deferred stock
compensation resulting from Tality option grants and sales of
Tality restricted stock. On October 9, 2000, Cadence
announced the



postponement of Tality’s IPO due to
unfavorable market conditions. As a result of the postponement
of the Tality IPO, Cadence wrote off $2.8 million of
IPO-related expenses in the first quarter of 2001. In addition
to the $2.8 million, Cadence also expensed
$2.0 million of Tality separation costs in 2001, related
primarily to information systems separation, legal and
consulting fees. On April 17, 2001, Cadence announced the
withdrawal of the Tality IPO registration statement. Tality was
reorganized and restructured during the second, third and fourth
quarters of 2001, and is currently a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Cadence. See “Unusual Items — Tality IPO-Related
Expense and Separation Costs.”

Restructurings
and Assets Impairments

In 2001, Cadence announced a worldwide
restructuring plan targeted at reducing workforce and
consolidating facilities and assets. The restructuring plan was
initiated primarily due to the severe downturn in the economic
environment in the electronics industry, particularly in the
United States. The restructuring was primarily aimed at reducing
excess personnel and capacity costs within its Tality
subsidiary, dedicating Cadence’s resources to growth areas,
and focusing on profit contribution. Cadence recorded
$61.6 million of restructuring charges associated with the
worldwide restructuring plan. Cadence’s restructuring plan
and associated costs consisted of $20.8 million for
reduction in personnel, $22.7 million to downsize and close
excess facilities and $16.6 million of asset impairment
charges related to certain long-lived assets. Management
estimates that the restructuring will result in annualized cost
reductions of approximately $70.4 million in employee
salary and benefit costs and $47.6 million in facility
costs.

The restructuring plan resulted in a reduction of
705 employees, which were predominately Tality employees.
While employee reductions are across all business functions,
operating units and geographic regions, Cadence’s wireless
communications-related areas within Tality were affected more
than other areas. In addition, the number of temporary and
contract workers employed by Cadence has been reduced.

In February 2002, Cadence announced a further
restructuring of its Tality business to increase its focus on
communications IC design and intellectual property used in
wireline communications equipment and to no longer provides
board-level, mechanical and packaging services for data and
telecommunications equipment. As a result, Tality will reduce
its headcount by approximately 200 people. The reductions
will result in the closure of its Ottawa, Canada; Lowell,
Massachusetts; and Noida, India design centers. A restructuring
charge of approximately $25.0 million will be taken in the
first quarter of 2002 for severance, facility closure and
related asset impairments.

Avant!
Restitution Award

On July 25, 2001, Avant! Corporation was
ordered to pay Cadence $194.6 million in criminal
restitution after Avant! entered a plea of no contest and was
found guilty by the Superior Court of the State of California of
conspiracy to take and use Cadence’s trade secrets. This
conspiracy included the theft by Avant! and certain individuals
of Cadence intellectual property, including software code, as
well as other trade secrets. As of December 29, 2001,
approximately $196.0 million, consisting of all of the
restitution award plus interest was received. This amount is
recorded in restructuring, asset impairment and unusual items in
Cadence’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Critical Accounting Policies

Cadence’s critical accounting policies are
as follows:

•

revenue recognition for its various business
	units;

•

estimating valuation allowances and accrued
	liabilities;

•

accounting for income taxes; and

•

valuation of long-lived and intangible assets and
	goodwill.



Revenue recognition.

Cadence derives revenue from three sources:
(i) product revenue, which includes software licensing and
hardware sales, (ii) maintenance revenue from software and
hardware and (iii) services revenue. As described below,
significant management judgments and estimates are made and used
to determine the revenue recognized in any accounting period.
Material differences may result in the amount and timing of
Cadence’s revenue for any period if different conditions
were to prevail, such as a different mix of license types or a
different payment history, each as described below.

Cadence applies the provisions of Statement of
Position 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition,” as
amended by Statement of Position 98-9 “Modification of SOP
97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain
Transactions” to all transactions involving the sale of
software products and sales of hardware where the software is
not incidental.

Cadence recognizes product revenue when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has
been delivered, the fee is fixed and determinable, collection of
the resulting receivable is probable and vendor specific
objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee among all
delivered and undelivered elements in the arrangement. Vendor
specific objective evidence of fair value is defined as the
value of each element of an arrangement if sold separately and
is established when a software vendor demonstrates a history of
having sold the element separately and of collecting on that
element from a representative sample of arrangements on a
consistent basis. If vendor-specific objective evidence of fair
value does not exist for all elements to support the allocation
of the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of
the arrangement, revenue is deferred until such evidence does
exist for the undelivered elements, or until all elements are
delivered, whichever is earlier.

Cadence sells software using three license types.
These license types are:

•

Term licenses — software licensed for a
	specific time period, generally two to three years, with no
	rights to return or exchange the licensed software;

•

Subscription licenses — software
	licensed for a specific time period, generally two to three
	years, with no rights to return and limited rights to exchange
	the licensed software for unspecified future technology; and

•

Perpetual licenses — software licensed
	on a perpetual basis with no right to return or exchange the
	licensed software.

For term and subscription licenses, Cadence uses
a signed contract as evidence of an arrangement. For perpetual
licenses, hardware sales and maintenance renewals, Cadence uses
a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement. Sales through
its Japanese distributor are evidenced by a master agreement
governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders
on a transaction-by-transaction basis. For services, Cadence
uses a signed statement of work to evidence an arrangement.

Software is delivered to customers electronically
or on a CD-ROM. With respect to hardware, delivery of an entire
system is deemed to occur upon installation.

Cadence assesses whether the fee is fixed and
determinable based on the payment terms associated with the
transaction. Cadence uses installment contracts for term and
subscription licenses for which it has established a history of
collecting under the original contract without providing
concessions on payments, products or services. The time periods
of installment contracts are equal to or less than the time
period of the licenses and are generally collected quarterly. If
different conditions were to prevail and Cadence no longer had a
history of collecting without providing concessions on term
licenses, then revenue from term licenses would be required to
be recognized ratably over the term of the licenses. This change
would have a material impact on Cadence’s reported results.
For example, approximately 50% of Cadence’s software
license revenues were derived from term licenses in 2001.

Cadence assesses collectibility based on a number
of factors, including the customer’s past payment history
and its current credit-worthiness. If Cadence determines that
collection of a fee is not reasonably



assured, Cadence defers the revenue and
recognizes it at the time collection becomes reasonably assured,
which is generally upon receipt of cash payment.

Provided all the related conditions discussed
above are met, Cadence recognizes revenue for each software
license type as follows:

•

Term licenses and Perpetual licenses —
	revenue associated with licensed software is recognized upon the
	effective date of the license; and

•

Subscription licenses — revenue
	associated with licensed software is recognized ratably over the
	term of the license commencing upon the effective date of the
	license.

Maintenance revenue consists of fees for
providing technical support and software updates. Cadence
recognizes all maintenance revenue ratably over the contract
term regardless of the software license agreement type. For term
and perpetual licenses, customers renew maintenance agreements
annually.

Services revenue consists primarily of revenue
received for performing methodology and design services.
Fixed-price methodology and design service contracts are
accounted for using contract accounting, which is generally the
percentage-of-completion method rather than the
completed-contract method, and time and materials contracts are
accounted for on a monthly basis as work is performed. In
addition, for small fixed-price-projects, such as training
classes and small, standard methodology service engagements of
approximately $10,000 in size or less, revenue is recognized
when the work is completed. Cadence has a history of accurately
estimating project status and the cost to complete projects. If
different conditions were to prevail where accurate estimates
could not be made, then the use of the completed contract method
would be required and all revenue and costs would be deferred
until the project was completed. This change would have a
material impact on Cadence’s reported results

Estimating
valuation allowances and accrued liabilities.

The preparation of financial statements requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported
period.

Management specifically analyzes accounts
receivable and also analyzes historical bad debts, customer
concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic
trends and changes in customer payment terms, changes in
customer demand and sales returns when evaluating the adequacy
of the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns in any
accounting period. Material differences may result in the amount
and timing of revenue and or expenses for any period if
management made different judgments or utilized different
estimates.

Cadence has effected restructurings of its
business units in the past and has established reserves at the
low end of the range of estimable cost (as required by
accounting standards) against outstanding commitments for leased
properties that it has vacated. These reserves are based upon
management’s estimate of the landlord’s willingness to
negotiate a termination fee, the time require to sublet the
properties and the amount of sublet income that might be
generated between the date the property was vacated and
expiration of the lease for each of the vacated properties.
These estimates are reviewed and revised quarterly and may
result in a substantial increase to restructuring expense should
different conditions prevail than were anticipated in original
management estimates.

Cadence assesses the need for reserves on
inventory based on forward projections of sales of hardware
products that are updated monthly. As a result of these
projections, all inventory value in excess of
12 months’ sales projections (except for inventory
expected to be used in ongoing service and maintenance of the
installed base of customer owned systems) is reserved. Once
inventory is reserved, the reserve can only be relieved by the
subsequent sale or scrapping of the inventory.



Accounting for income taxes.

In preparing its consolidated financial
statements, Cadence is required to estimate its income taxes in
each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This process
involves estimating actual current tax liability together with
assessing temporary differences resulting from differing
treatment of items, such as deferred revenue, for tax and
accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax
assets and liabilities, which are included within the
consolidated balance sheet. Cadence then assesses the likelihood
that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable
income, and to the extent it believes that recovery is not
likely, Cadence must establish a valuation allowance. To the
extent Cadence establishes a valuation allowance for provision
or increases this allowance in a period, Cadence includes an
expense within the tax provision in its Consolidated Statement
of Operations.

Significant management judgment is required in
determining the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets
and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net
deferred tax assets. Cadence recorded a valuation allowance for
2001 due to uncertainties related to its ability to utilize some
of the deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of certain net
operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits, before
they expire. The valuation allowance is based on estimates of
taxable income by jurisdiction in which Cadence operates and the
period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable. In
the event that actual results differ from these estimates or
Cadence adjust these estimates in future periods, Cadence may
need to establish an additional valuation allowance, which could
materially impact financial position and results of operations.

Valuation of intangible assets and
	goodwill.

Cadence periodically reviews long-lived assets,
certain identifiable intangibles and goodwill related to these
assets for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 121,
“Accounting for the Impairment of Long-lived Assets and For
Long-lived Assets to be Disposed Of.”

For assets to be held and used, including
acquired intangibles, Cadence initiates its review whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its
carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows
(without interest charges) that the asset is expected to
generate. Any impairment to be recognized is measured by the
amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its
fair market value. Significant management judgment is required
in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in
the preparation of projected discounted cash flows and should
different conditions prevail, material write downs of net
intangible assets and/or goodwill could occur.

It is reasonably possible that the estimates of
anticipated future gross revenue, the remaining estimated
economic life of the products and technologies, or both, could
differ from those used to assess the recoverability of these
costs and result in a write-down of the carrying amount or a
shortened life of acquired intangibles in the future.

In 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets” became effective and as a result,
Cadence will cease to amortize approximately $311.0 million
of goodwill. In lieu of amortization, Cadence is required to
perform an initial impairment review of goodwill in 2002 and an
annual impairment review thereafter. Cadence expects to complete
its initial review during the first quarter of 2002, but does
not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the
initial impairment review. However, there can be no assurance
that at the time the review is completed a material impairment
charge will not be recorded.



Results of Operations

Revenue

Sources of Revenue as a Percent of Total
Revenue

Product revenue increased $203.1 million in
2001 compared to 2000, primarily due to an overall increase in
price and volume of license renewal with major customers, and to
a lesser extent an increase in new sales of Cadence’s
software products to new customers. The increase in sales volume
was primarily due to an increase in sales volume of
Cadence’s integrated circuit implementation products, which
include synthesis place and route physical design and physical
verification products. The increases were partially offset by a
decrease in Quickturn product sales. Management expects
Quickturn’s revenue to continue to decline due to the
slowdown in the economy and the electronics industry in
particular. Cadence’s software licenses revenue recognized
on a ratable basis comprised 32%, 19% and 11% of software
revenue for the years ended 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Product revenue increased $122.0 million in
2000 compared to 1999, primarily due to an overall increase in
price and volume of license renewals with major customers. The
increases in sales volume of products was primarily attributable
to increased sales of: intellectual property-creation products,
which include mixed signal and simulation products; integrated
circuit implementation products, which include place and route,
physical design and physical verification products; and printed
circuit board-related products.

Services revenue decreased $72.6 million in
2001 compared to 2000, primarily due to a reduction in
customers’ spending budgets for external services resulting
in a decrease in engagements. The decrease was the result of the
economic slowdown experienced in the telecommunications,
consumer products and a decline in use of outside services by
Cadence’s customers. Cadence believes that the slowdown
will continue throughout 2002. Tality’s revenue declined
$49.9 million in 2001 compared to 2000, primarily due to
fewer active engagements and fewer services hours billed.
Tality’s revenue is expected to continue to be affected by
the slowdown in the economy generally and electronics industry
specifically, and reductions of its workforce in connection with
its restructurings. Methodology Services revenue declined $22.2
million in 2001 compared to 2000, primarily due to a general
weakness in customer demand for short-term consulting services.

Services revenue increased $41.1 million in
2000 compared to 1999, primarily due to an increase in Tality
revenue of $69.5 million, partially offset by a decrease of
$28.4 million in methodology services revenue.
Tality’s revenue increase was primarily due to increases in
the total size of active client engagements and total client
service hours billed. The decrease in methodology services
engagements was primarily due to lower staffing levels, which
were insufficient to service additional projects.

Maintenance revenue increased $20.4 million
in 2001 compared to 2000, primarily due to the growth of
Cadence’s installed customer base and the renewal of
maintenance and support contracts. Maintenance revenue increased
$23.2 million in 2000 compared to 1999, primarily due to
the growth of the installed customer base.



Revenue by Geography

Revenue by Geography as a Percent of Total
Revenue

International revenue increased
$86.2 million in 2001 compared to 2000, primarily due to
increases in product revenue worldwide and maintenance revenue
in Europe and Asia, partially offset by a decrease in services
revenue worldwide.

International revenue decreased $7.7 million
in 2000 compared to 1999, primarily due to decreases in product
revenue in Japan and services revenue in Europe and Japan,
partially offset by an increase in product and maintenance
revenue in Europe.

Differences in the rate of revenue growth over
the periods presented and as compared geographically are
primarily due to fluctuations in sales volume of integrated
circuit implementation and intellectual property creation
products and of Cadence’s design and methodology services
offerings based upon contractual renewal cycles in Europe and a
general economic decline in Japan.

Foreign currency exchange rates negatively
affected revenue by $19.9 million in 2001, primarily due to the
weakening of the Japanese yen. Foreign currency exchange rates
negatively affected revenue by $3.8 million in 2000,
primarily due to the weakening of the British pound and German
mark in relation to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by the
strengthening of the Japanese yen in relation to the U.S.
dollar. Additional information about revenue by geographic areas
can be found under “Segment Reporting” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cost of Revenue

Cost of Revenue as a Percent of Related
Revenue

Cost of product revenue includes costs of
employee salary and benefit costs, packaging and documentation,
royalties and amortization of capitalized development costs for
software products. Manufacturing costs associated with hardware
emulation system products include materials, labor and overhead.



Cost of product revenue increased
$8.2 million in 2001 compared to 2000. The increase was
primarily due to increases in inventory write-offs, partially
offset by decreases in manufacturing expenses associated with
the decrease in sales of emulation system products. In the year
ended December 29, 2001, Cadence recorded an
$18.9 million reserve against inventory in cost of product
revenue. Of the $18.9 million, $15.2 million of the
reserve was related to excess inventory from decreased sales
forecasts and $3.7 million related to two product lines
that were discontinued as part of Cadence’s restructuring.
The excess inventory charge of $15.2 million was due to a
sudden and significant decrease in forecasted revenue for
emulation products and was calculated in accordance with
Cadence’s policy, which is based on inventory in excess of
12-month demand. Inventory purchases and commitments are based
on future sales forecasts. Cadence typically buys and builds
inventory levels for certain key components to mitigate
component supply constraints. Based on Cadence’s current
12-month demand forecast, Cadence does not anticipate that the
excess inventory subject to these reserves will be used at a
later date. Cost of product revenue increased $10.4 million
in 2000 compared to 1999. The increase was primarily due to
increases in manufacturing expenses associated with emulation
system products and amortization of capitalized software
development costs.

Because the majority of Cadence’s cost of
software product revenue does not vary significantly with
changes in revenue, product gross margin increased in 2001
compared to 2000, primarily due to an increase in volume of
license renewals with major customer.

Cost of services revenue includes costs
associated with providing services to customers, primarily
employee salary and benefits, costs to recruit, develop and
retain personnel and to maintain the infrastructure necessary to
manage a services organization as well as provisions for lost
contracts, if any. Cost of services revenue decreased
$24.3 million in 2001 compared to 2000, primarily due to
decreases in employee salary and benefit costs resulting from
Cadence’s reduction of services professionals in connection
with its restructuring initiated in 2001. Cost of services
revenue increased $23.8 million in 2000 compared to 1999,
primarily due to an increase in the number of design engineers
in Tality.

Services gross margin decreased in 2001 compared
to 2000, primarily due to the slowdown in the economy generally
and in the electronics systems industry in particular resulting
in revenues declining faster than costs. Services gross margins
remained relatively flat in 2000 as compared to 1999. Services
gross margin has been, and may continue to be reduced by,
Cadence’s inability to fully utilize its services resources.

Cost of maintenance revenue includes the cost of
customer services, such as hot-line and on-site support,
production personnel, packaging and documentation of maintenance
updates. Cost of maintenance increased $2.0 million in 2001
compared to 2000, primarily due to an increase in employee
salary and benefit costs resulting from an increase in employee
headcount. Cost of maintenance revenue increased
$9.7 million in 2000 compared to 1999, primarily due to
costs associated with the OrCAD acquisition and increases in
employee salary and benefit costs and costs to invest in
customer service. The OrCAD acquisition was completed in the
third quarter of 1999, and therefore, there were no similar
costs in the first seven months of 1999.

Operating Expenses



Operating Expenses as a Percent of Total
	Revenue

Marketing and Sales

Marketing and sales expenses increased
$3.5 million in 2001 compared to 2000, primarily due to an
increase in employee salary and benefit costs resulting from an
increase in employee headcounts, partially offset by a decrease
in commissions expense from volume and rate changes. Marketing
and sales expenses increased $35.9 million in 2000 compared
to 1999, primarily due to an increase in employee salary and
benefit costs, the inclusion of OrCAD-related expenses for the
full year of fiscal 2000, and marketing program costs, partially
offset by lower consulting costs.

Research and Development

Research and development expense, prior to the
reduction for capitalization of software development costs was
$327.5 million for 2001, $292.4 million for 2000 and
$244.9 million for 1999, representing 23% of total revenue
for 2001 and 2000 and 22% for 1999. Cadence capitalized software
development costs of approximately $30.2 million for 2001,
$28.4 million for 2000, and $25.7 million for 1999,
which represented approximately 9% of total research and
development expenditures for 2001 and 10% of research and
development expenditures for 2000 and 1999. The increase in
capitalized software development costs in each of these three
years resulted primarily from increases in new product
development projects that have reached technological
feasibility. In any given period, the amount of capitalized
software development costs may vary depending on the exact
nature of the development performed.

The increase in net research and development
expenses of $33.4 million for 2001 compared to 2000, was
primarily due to an increase in employee salary and benefit
costs resulting from an increase in employee headcount. The
increase in net research and development expenses of
$44.7 million for 2000, compared to 1999, was primarily
attributable to higher employee salary and benefit costs and the
inclusion of OrCAD- related costs and expenses for the full year
of fiscal 2000.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses increased
$20.1 million in 2001 compared to 2000, primarily due to an
increase of employee salary and benefit costs resulting from an
increase in employee headcount, increases in bad debt expenses
related to Tality accounts receivable, and increased use of
outside consulting services. General and administrative expenses
increased $7.7 million in 2000 compared to 1999, primarily
due to employee salary and benefit costs, partially offset by
decreases in bad debt expense and consulting and outside
services costs.

Foreign currency exchange rates positively
affected operating expenses by $9.3 million in 2001,
compared to 2000, primarily due to the weakening of the Japanese
yen and British pound in relation to the U.S. dollar. Foreign
currency exchange rates positively affected operating expenses
by $3.8 million in 2000, compared to 1999, primarily due to
the weakening of the British pound, the German mark and the
French franc in relation to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by
the strengthening of the Japanese yen in relation to the U.S.
dollar.

Amortization of Acquired
Intangibles



Amortization of Acquired Intangibles as a
Percent of Total Revenue

Amortization of acquired intangibles increased
$11.8 million in 2001 compared to 2000, primarily due to
the 2001 acquisition of CadMOS,

partially offset
by a reduction attributable to the write-off of Diablo goodwill
in the second quarter of 2001. Amortization of acquired
intangibles increased $18.7 million in 2000 compared to
1999, primarily due to a full year’s amortization related
to Cadence’s 1999 acquisitions of OrCAD and Diablo,
partially offset by the decrease in amortization related to the
$13.3 million asset impairment charge of Excellent Design
Inc. in the fourth quarter of 1999. For additional information
regarding these acquisitions see “In-Process
Technology.”

Amortization of Deferred Stock
Compensation

Amortization of Deferred Stock Compensation
as a Percent of Total Revenue

Cadence records deferred stock compensation
resulting from option grants for Tality stock, sales of Tality
restricted stock and Cadence’s acquisitions of CadMOS and
SPC. Deferred stock compensation from Tality option grants and
restricted stock sales represents the difference between the
exercise price of stock option grants to Tality employees and
directors, and the price paid for restricted stock sales to
certain Cadence executives and employees, and the deemed fair
market value of Tality’s common stock at the time of those
grants and sales. Deferred stock compensation from the CadMOS
acquisition represents the difference between the exercise price
of stock option grants to CadMOS employees and the fair market
value of Cadence’s common stock at the time of acquisition.
Cadence is amortizing the deferred stock compensation to expense
over the period during which the stock options and restricted
stock vest. In the second and third quarters of 2001, Cadence
repurchased 1,740,000 restricted Tality shares from certain
Cadence executives and employees, who then repaid their related
notes payable to Cadence. Tality repurchased 220,000 restricted
Tality shares from three of its directors. The purchase price
was $6.10 per share, the fair market value of Tality stock at
the time of repurchase. The increase in amortization of deferred
stock compensation of $6.5 million for 2001 when compared
to 2000, was primarily due to the absence of similar costs in
the first six months of 2000. For the years ended
December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000, Cadence
recorded a total of $40.4 million and $72.4 million of
deferred stock compensation, respectively. Of the
$40.4 million, $27.4 million is related to the
acquisition of SPC, $10.0 million is related to the
acquisition of CadMOS, and $3.0 million is related to
Tality stock option grants. Of the $72.4 million,
$64.1 million is related to the stock option grants and
$8.3 million is related to the sales of Tality restricted
stock in 2000. Cadence is amortizing the deferred stock
compensation over the period during which the stock options and
restricted stock were vesting. For the year ended
December 29, 2001, Cadence reversed deferred stock
compensation of $27.8 million related to the cancellation
of options and the repurchase of Tality restricted stock.



Unusual Items

Described below are unusual items in 2001, 2000
and 1999.

Avant! Criminal Restitution

On July 25, 2001, Avant! Corporation was
ordered to pay Cadence $194.6 million in criminal
restitution after Avant! entered a plea of no contest and was
found guilty by the Superior Court of the State of California of
conspiracy to take and use Cadence’s trade secrets. This
conspiracy included the theft by Avant! and certain individuals
of Cadence intellectual property, including software code, as
well as other trade secrets. As of December 29, 2001,
approximately $196.0 million, consisting of the entire
restitution award plus interest was received. This amount was
recorded in restructuring, asset impairment and unusual items in
Cadence’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Tality IPO-Related Expense and Separation
Costs

In the year ended December 29, 2001, Cadence
recorded $4.8 million in separation costs. Of the
$4.8 million, $2.8 million related to the postponement
of the Tality IPO and $2.0 million related toTality
separation costs, primarily information systems separation and
legal, accounting and consulting fees.

In the year ended December 30, 2000, Cadence
recorded $6.8 million in separation costs related to the
separation, and the related planned IPO of Tality,
Cadence’s then newly-formed subsidiary. These costs
primarily include legal and accounting services, strategic
business planning, information systems separation, development
of compensation and benefits strategies, and recruitment and
formation of Tality’s senior management team.

In-Process Technology

In December 2001, Cadence acquired SPC, a
privately-held design technology firm for approximately
6.8 million shares of Cadence stock, valued at
$132.5 million. SPC provides electronic design tools that
bridge the gap between front-end logic designers and the
back-end physical design process. The purchase price could
increase if certain predetermined performance goals are achieved
in fiscal 2002 and 2003. In connection with the acquisition,
Cadence acquired goodwill of $97.9 million and technology,
trademarks, employee agreements and other assumed contractual
obligations intangibles of $19.5 million. The technology
and other acquired intangibles are being amortized over one to
five years.

Upon completion of the SPC acquisition, Cadence
immediately charged to expense $8.6 million representing
acquired in-process technology that had not yet reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The
value assigned to acquired in-process technology was determined
by identifying research projects in areas for which
technological feasibility has not been established. The value
was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired
in-process technology into commercially viable products,
estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and
discounting the net cash flows back to their present value. The
discount rate included a factor that took into account the
uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the
acquired in-process technology. The in-process technology is
expected to be



commercially viable in 2002. As of
December 29, 2001, expenditures to complete the in-process
technology totaled $1.2 million and expenditures to
complete the remaining in-process technology are expected to
total approximately $0.9 million. This estimate is subject
to change, given the uncertainties of the development process,
and no assurance can be given that deviations from these
estimates will not occur. Additionally, these projects will
require additional research and development after they have
reached a state of technological and commercial feasibility.

At the time of its acquisition by Cadence,
SPC’s in-process research and development projects were
related to the development of a signal integrity analysis and
optimization tool, and development of an enhanced version of its
routing-estimation technology. These capabilities are important
for IC design at and below 0.13 micron geometries. The
nature of the efforts to complete these projects related, in
varying degrees, to the completion of all planning, designing,
prototyping, verification and testing activities necessary to
establish that the proposed technologies meet their design
specifications, including functional, technical and economic
performance requirements.

The net cash flows resulting from the projects
underway at SPC used to value the purchased research and
development were based on management’s estimates of
revenue, cost of revenue, research and development costs,
selling, general and administrative costs, and income taxes from
such projects. The revenue projections were based on the
potential market size that the projects address, Cadence’s
ability to gain market acceptance in these segments, and the
life cycle of this in-process technology.

Estimated total revenue from the acquired
in-process technology is expected to peak in 2004 and decline
rapidly thereafter as other new products are expected to enter
the market. In addition, a portion of the anticipated revenue
had been attributed to enhancements of the base technology under
development, and has been excluded from net cash flow
calculations. Existing technology was valued at
$8.4 million. The net cash flows generated from the
acquired in-process technology were expected to reflect earnings
before interest, taxes and depreciation of approximately 35% of
the revenue generated from in-process technology. However, there
can be no assurance that these assumptions will prove accurate,
or that Cadence will realize the anticipated benefit of the
acquisition.

The discount of the net cash flows to their
present value was based on the weighted average cost of capital,
or WACC. The WACC calculation produces the average required rate
of return of an investment in an operating enterprise, based on
the required rates of return from investments in various areas
of the enterprise. The rate used to discount the net cash flows
from purchased in-process technology was 36%. The discount rate
is sometimes higher than the WACC due to the inherent
uncertainties in the estimates, including the uncertainty
surrounding the successful development of the acquired
in-process technology, the useful life of such technology, the
profitability levels of such technology, if any, and the
uncertainty of technological advances, all of which were unknown
at that time.

In the three months ended June 30, 2001,
Cadence acquired substantially all of the assets of two
companies for a preliminary aggregate price of
$10.5 million, of which $4.4 million was cash and
$6.1 million was shares of Cadence common stock, plus
future contingent payments. The acquisitions were accounted for
as purchases. Upon consummation of the acquisitions, Cadence
immediately charged to expense $1.0 million representing
acquired in-process technology that had not yet reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative future use.

In February 2001, Cadence acquired CadMOS Design
Technology, Inc., a privately-held design tools firm for
approximately 3.6 million shares of Cadence common stock
valued at $92.7 million. The acquisition was accounted for
as a purchase. CadMOS provides solutions to the noise problems
experienced in ultra-deep submicron processes. The purchase
price will increase up to an additional 488,970 shares if
certain predetermined performance goals are achieved over the
three years following the acquisition. These goals are bookings,
product development and continued employment of certain CadMOS
employees. In connection with the acquisition, Cadence
preliminarily allocated the purchase price primarily to goodwill
of $58.3 million and technology and other intangibles of
$12.9 million. The technology and other acquired
intangibles are being amortized over three to five years. The
results of operations of CadMOS and the estimated fair value of
the



assets acquired and liabilities assumed are
included in Cadence’s consolidated financial statements
from the date of acquisition.

Upon consummation of the CadMOS acquisition,
Cadence immediately charged to expense $12.1 million
representing acquired in-process technology that had not yet
reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future
use. The value assigned to acquired in-process technology was
determined by identifying research projects in areas for which
technological feasibility has not been established. The value
was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired
in-process technology into commercially viable products,
estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and
discounting the net cash flows back to their present value. The
discount rate included a factor that took into account the
uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the
acquired in-process technology. The in-process technology is
expected to be commercially viable in 2002. As of
December 29, 2001, expenditures to complete the in-process
technology totaled $1.0 million and expenditures to
complete the remaining in-process technology are expected to
total approximately $0.9 million. These estimates are
subject to change, given the uncertainties of the development
process, and no assurance can be given that deviations from
these estimates will not occur. Additionally, these projects
will require additional research and development after they have
reached a state of technological and commercial feasibility.

At the time of its acquisition by Cadence,
CadMOS’ in-process research and development projects were
related to the development of a static timing analysis tool, the
development of advanced fixing capabilities in the noise
analysis area, and in the mixed signal area, the development of
a flow to integrate with Cadence tools and a tool to analyze
large application-specific integrated circuit designs for
substrate noise. The nature of the efforts to complete these
projects related, in varying degrees, to the completion of all
planning, designing, prototyping, verification and testing
activities necessary to establish that the proposed technologies
meet their design specifications including functional, technical
and economic performance requirements.

The net cash flows resulting from the projects
underway at CadMOS used to value the purchased research and
development were based on management’s estimates of
revenue, cost of revenue, research and development costs,
selling, general and administrative costs and income taxes from
such projects. The revenue projections were based on the
potential market size that the projects address, Cadence’s
ability to gain market acceptance in these segments, and the
life cycle of this in-process technology.

Estimated total revenue from the acquired
in-process technology is expected to peak in 2004 and decline
rapidly thereafter as other new products are expected to enter
the market. In addition, a portion of the anticipated revenue
had been attributed to enhancements of the base technology under
development, and has been excluded from net cash flow
calculations. Existing technology was valued at
$3.6 million. The net cash flows generated from the
acquired in-process technology were expected to reflect earnings
before interest, taxes, and depreciation of approximately 50% of
the revenue generated from in-process technology. However, there
can be no assurance that these assumptions will prove accurate,
or that Cadence will realize the anticipated benefit of the
acquisition.

The discount of the net cash flows to their
present value was based on the WACC. The rate used to discount
the net cash flows from purchased in-process technology was 28%.
The discount rate is sometimes higher than the WACC due to the
inherent uncertainties in the estimates, including the
uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the
acquired in-process technology, the useful life of such
technology, the profitability levels of such technology, if any,
and the uncertainty of technological advances, all of which were
unknown at that time.

In August 1999, Cadence acquired OrCAD, Inc., a
supplier of computer-aided engineering and computer-aided design
software and services for the printed circuit board industry,
for cash. Cadence acquired all of the outstanding stock of OrCAD
and assumed all outstanding OrCAD stock options. The purchase
price was $131.4 million, and the acquisition was accounted
for as a purchase.

Upon consummation of the OrCAD acquisition,
Cadence immediately charged to expense $11.8 million
representing acquired in-process technology that had not yet
reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future
use. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”
The value assigned to acquired



in-process technology was determined by
identifying research projects in areas for which technological
feasibility has not been established. The value was determined
by estimating the costs to develop the acquired in-process
technology into commercially viable products, estimating the
resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the
net cash flows back to their present value. The discount rate
included a factor that took into account the uncertainty
surrounding the successful development of the acquired
in-process technology. Certain acquired in-process technology
was commercially viable in 1999 and other acquired in-process
technology became commercially viable in 2000. Expenditures to
complete this acquired in-process technology did not exceed
$2.3 million.

At the time of its acquisition by Cadence,
OrCAD’s in-process research and development projects in the
schematic entry area were related to the development of an
online component catalog and a new schematic design entry
interface. In-process research and development projects in the
simulation area were related to a rearchitecture of the
simulation engine and replacement of the simulation engine.
Additional features under development included randomized
expressions and no selection limits. The nature of the efforts
to complete these projects related, in varying degrees, to the
completion of all planning, designing, prototyping, verification
and testing activities that were necessary to establish that the
proposed technologies meet their design specifications including
functional, technical and economic performance requirements.

The net cash flows resulting from the projects
underway at OrCAD used to value the purchased research and
development were based on management’s estimates of
revenue, cost of revenue, research and development costs,
selling, general and administrative costs and income taxes from
such projects. The revenue projections were based on the
potential market size that the projects address, Cadence’s
ability to gain market acceptance in these segments, and the
life cycle of this in-process technology.

Estimated total revenue from the acquired
in-process technology is expected to peak in 2001 and decline
rapidly thereafter as other new products are expected to enter
the market. In addition, a portion of the anticipated revenue
had been attributed to enhancements of the base technology under
development, and had been excluded from net cash flow
calculations. Existing technology was valued at
$10.8 million. The net cash flows generated from the
acquired in-process technology were expected to reflect earnings
before interest, taxes and depreciation of approximately 32% of
the sales generated from in-process technology. However, there
can be no assurance that these assumptions will prove accurate,
or that Cadence will realize the anticipated benefit of the
acquisition.

The discount of the net cash flows to their
present value was based on the WACC. The rate used to discount
the net cash flows from purchased in-process technology was 22%.
The discount rate is sometimes higher than the WACC due to the
inherent uncertainties in the estimates, including the
uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the
acquired in-process technology, the useful life of such
technology, the profitability levels of such technology, if any,
and the uncertainty of technological advances, all of which were
unknown at that time.

In January 1999, Cadence acquired Design
Automation, Inc., or DAI, a supplier of design verification
technology used in SoC design. Cadence acquired all of the
outstanding stock of DAI for approximately 0.6 million
shares of Cadence common stock and $2.9 million of cash.
The total purchase price was $25.7 million and the
acquisition was accounted for as a purchase.

Upon consummation of the DAI acquisition, Cadence
immediately charged to expense $8.9 million representing
acquired in-process technology that had not yet reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. See
“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements —
Other Acquisitions.” The value assigned to acquired
in-process technology was determined by identifying research
projects in areas for which technological feasibility has not
been established. The value was determined by estimating the
costs to develop the acquired in-process technology into
commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash
flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back
to their present value. The discount rate included a factor that
took into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful
development of the acquired in-process technology. Certain
acquired in-process technology under development at the time of
acquisition was initially expected to become commercially viable
in 1999, but instead became viable in 2000. Expenditures to
complete this in-process technology did not exceed
$1.5 million.



At the time of its acquisition by Cadence, DAI
had several significant research and development projects in
process that were intended to provide a next generation
environment for design verification and analysis. These efforts
included the development of a highly automated approach for
high-level test bench creation and analysis, a waveform viewer
capable of supporting analog and mixed signal designs and a tool
designed to analyze verification code coverage at the
transactional level. The nature of the efforts to complete these
in-process research and development projects related, in varying
degrees, to the completion of all planning, designing,
prototyping, verification and testing activities that were
necessary to establish that the proposed in-process technologies
meet their design specifications, which include functional,
technical and economic performance requirements.

The net cash flows generated by the projects
underway at DAI used to value the acquired in-process technology
were based on management’s estimates of revenue, cost of
revenue, research and development costs, selling, general and
administrative costs and income taxes from such projects. The
revenue projections were based on the potential market size that
these projects address, Cadence’s ability to gain market
acceptance for these projects, and the life cycle of this
in-process technology.

Estimated total revenue from the acquired
in-process technology is expected to peak in 2001 through 2002
and decline rapidly thereafter as other new products are
expected to enter the market. In addition, a portion of the
anticipated revenue has been attributed to enhancements of the
base technology under development, and has been excluded from
net cash flow calculations. Existing technology was valued at
$11.4 million at the time of acquisition. The net cash
flows generated from the acquired in-process technology are
expected to reflect earnings before interest, taxes and
depreciation of approximately 60% of the sales generated from
in-process technology. However, there can be no assurance that
these assumptions will prove accurate, or that Cadence will
realize the anticipated benefits of this acquisition.

The discount applied to the net cash flows to
calculate the present value of such net cash flows was based on
the WACC. The rate used to discount the net cash flows from
purchased in-process technology was 22%.

Acquired Intangibles Write-Offs

In reaction to the current decline in business
conditions generally and the wireless communications industry in
particular, Cadence restructured certain of its businesses and
realigned resources to focus on profit contribution, high-growth
markets and core opportunities. As a result, Cadence recorded a
charge of $25.8 million in 2001 related to the impairment
of goodwill and acquired intangibles associated with the
acquisition of Diablo (a part of Tality). Key factors in this
write-off were significant downsizing or reassignment of
personnel directly related to these assets and abandonment of
most of Diablo’s line of business. The charge was
determined as the amount by which the carrying value of the
intangible assets associated with Diablo’s acquisition
exceeded the fair value of those assets.

In 1999, Cadence incurred a total of
$19.9 million in asset impairment charges. Of this amount,
$13.3 million represented asset impairment of acquired
intangibles from the Excellent Design, or EXD, acquisition. This
asset impairment charge resulted from reduced Japanese sales and
the loss of key EXD employees, which together resulted in
diminished cash flow projections. Cadence entered into certain
support agreements with third parties to provide support for EXD
software tools previously sold by Cadence customers. The fair
value of the EXD acquired intangibles was based on an evaluation
of the present value of the estimated expected future cash
flows, discounted at 16%. The remaining $6.6 million in
asset impairment charges were incurred in connection with the
cancellation of an information technology services contract with
a third-party, the abandonment of capitalized software
development costs associated with certain Cadence products that
were discontinued, and the abandonment of certain third-party
software licenses, related to Research and Development.

Restructurings Charges and Asset
Impairments

In 2001, Cadence announced a worldwide
restructuring and asset impairment plan targeted at reducing
workforce and consolidating facilities and assets. The
restructuring plan was initiated primarily due to the severe
downturn in the economic environment in the United States,
particularly in the electronics industry.



The restructuring was primarily aimed at reducing
excess personnel and capacity costs within its Tality
subsidiary, dedicating Cadence’s resources to growth areas,
and focusing on profit contribution. Cadence recorded
$61.6 million of restructuring charges classified as
unusual operating expenses associated with the worldwide
restructuring plan. Cadence’s restructuring plan and
associated costs consisted of $20.8 million for reduction
in personnel, $22.7 million to downsize and close excess
facilities and $16.6 million of asset impairment charges
related to certain long-lived assets. Management estimates that
the restructuring will result in annualized cost reductions of
approximately $70.4 million in employee salary and benefit
costs and $47.6 million in facility costs.

The restructuring plan resulted in a reduction of
705 employees, which were predominately Tality employees. While
employee reductions are across all business functions, operating
units and geographic regions, Cadence’s wireless
communications-related areas within Tality were affected more
than other areas. In addition, the number of temporary and
contract workers employed by Cadence has been reduced. Severance
costs resulting from the restructuring included severance
benefits, notice pay and out-placement services. As the result
of the separation of Tality from Cadence, approximately
$5.3 million of the restructuring charges was paid to
certain Tality employees who were participants in Cadence’s
employee stock purchase plan prior to Tality’s separation
from Cadence in October 2000. All terminations and termination
benefits were communicated to the affected employees prior to
December 29, 2001. All severance benefits will be paid out
before the end of the first quarter of 2002.

Facilities consolidation charges of
$22.7 million were incurred in connection with the
downsizing and closing of 16 sites. Closure and downsizing
costs included payments required under lease contracts, less any
applicable estimated sublease income after the properties were
abandoned, lease buyout costs, restoration costs associated with
certain lease arrangements, and costs to maintain facilities
during the period after abandonment. To determine the lease
loss, which is the loss after Cadence’s cost recovery
efforts from subleasing a building, certain assumptions were
made related to the: (1) time period over which the
relevant building would remain vacant, (2) sublease terms
and (3) sublease rates, including common area charges. The
lease loss is an estimate under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 5

Accounting for Contingencies

and represents the low end of the range, as required by this
statement, $13.1 million, which will be adjusted in the
future upon triggering events (e.g., change in estimate of time
to sublease, actual sublease rates, etc.). Cadence has estimated
that the high end of the lease loss could be $52.8 million
if facilities operating lease rental rates continue to decrease
in the applicable markets or if it takes longer than expected to
find a suitable tenant to sublease the facility. As of
December 29, 2001, six sites had been vacated and
eight sites had been downsized.

Asset-related charges of $16.6 million
consisted primarily of $13.9 million of leasehold
improvements for facilities and other fixed assets that were
either abandoned or for which the resulting estimated future
reduced cash flows were insufficient to cover the associated
expenses. Cadence also recorded $2.2 million of
asset-related charges for abandoned software and
$1.5 million related to consulting services performed to
restructure the research and development process.

In 1999, Cadence recorded $13.3 million of
restructuring charges that consisted of $11.3 million to
terminate approximately 100 employees and $2.0 million to
downsize and close excess facilities. Cadence’s
restructuring plans were primarily aimed at reducing costs after
Cadence merged with Quickturn, further restructuring of
Cadence’s services business in Japan, and severance
resulting from the resignation of Cadence’s former Chief
Executive Officer. Severance costs include severance benefits,
notice pay and outplacement services. All terminations and
termination benefits were communicated to the affected employees
prior to year-end and substantially all remaining severance
benefits were paid in 2000.

Facilities consolidation charges of
$2.0 million were incurred in connection with the closure
of 15 Quickturn facilities, including $1.0 million to close
duplicate and excess facilities and $1.0 million of
abandonment costs for the related leasehold improvements.
Closure and exit costs include payments required under lease
contracts, less any applicable sublease income after the
properties were abandoned, lease buyout costs, restoration costs
associated with certain lease arrangements, and costs to
maintain facilities during the period after abandonment. Asset
related write-offs consist of leasehold improvements of
facilities that were



abandoned and whose estimated fair market value
is zero. As of December 29, 2001, 14 of the 15 Quickturn
sites had been vacated. Noncancelable lease payments on vacated
facilities will be paid through 2003.

Liabilities for excess facilities and other
restructuring charges are included in accrued and other
long-term liabilities while severance and benefits liabilities
are included in payroll and payroll-related accruals. Actual
amounts of termination benefits, facilities and other
restructuring-related payments can be found in Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements under “Restructuring,
Asset Impairment and Unusual Items.”

Merger Costs

In connection with the acquisition of Quickturn
in 1999, Cadence charged to expense merger costs of
$8.4 million, representing professional fees for financial
advisors, attorneys and accountants.

Litigation Settlement

In 1999, Cadence and Mentor announced the
settlement of a patent infringement action pending in the
U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. As a
result, the Court entered a judgment declaring that certain
Quickturn patents are valid, enforceable and were infringed by
Mentor’s sale of SimExpress products in the United States.
Mentor is permanently enjoined from producing, marketing, or
selling SimExpress emulation systems in the United States. In
connection with the settlement, Mentor paid Cadence
$3.0 million.

Other Income, net

Other income, net for 2001, 2000 and 1999 is as
follows:

Other income, net, decreased $2.9 million in
2001, when compared to 2000, primarily due to a decrease in
foreign exchange gains, partially offset by an increase in
interest income. Other income, net, increased $3.2 million
in 2000, when compared to 1999, primarily due to an increase in
foreign exchange gains, partially offset by $2.2 million of
investment losses from Telos Venture Partners, LP, in which
Cadence holds a limited partnership interest, shown in other
expense, net.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes and the effective
tax rates for 2001, 2000 and 1999 are as follows:

As of December 29, 2001, Cadence had total
net deferred tax assets of approximately $66.4 million.
Realization of the deferred tax assets will be dependent on
generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of
certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
Although realization is not assured, management believes that it
is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be
realized. The



amount of the net deferred tax assets, however,
could be reduced or increased in the near term if actual facts,
including the estimate of future taxable income, differ from
those estimated.

The 2001 effective tax rate includes the
approximately $196.0 million received from Avant! as
criminal restitution, the write-off of acquired in-process
technology of approximately $21.7 million and stock
compensation amortization of approximately $17.9 million.
The effective tax rate, excluding the Avant! restitution
proceeds, the write-off of acquired in-process technology and
stock compensation was 26.5%. The effective tax rate for 1999
includes the write-off of acquired in-process technology of
approximately $20.7 million. The effective tax rate for
1999 excluding the write-off of acquired in-process technology
was 28.9%.

Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

Cadence’s exposure to market risk for
changes in interest rates relates primarily to its investment
portfolio. While Cadence is exposed to interest rate
fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized
countries, Cadence’s interest income and expense is most
sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of
U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in
U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on
Cadence’s cash and cash equivalents, short-term and
long-term investments and interest paid on its long-term debt
obligations as well as costs associated with foreign currency
hedges.

Cadence invests in high quality credit issuers
and, by policy, limits the amount of its credit exposure to any
one issuer. As part of its policy, Cadence’s first priority
is to reduce the risk of principal loss. Consequently, Cadence
seeks to preserve its invested funds by limiting default risk,
market risk and reinvestment risk. Cadence mitigates default
risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that it
believes to be low risk and by positioning its portfolio to
respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit
rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio
includes only marketable securities with active secondary or
resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity.

On September 29, 2000, Cadence entered into
two syndicated, senior unsecured credit facilities that allow
Cadence to borrow up to $360.0 million. These two credit
facilities are referred to as the 2000 Facilities. One of the
2000 Facilities is a $100.0 million three-year revolving
credit facility, which terminates on September 29, 2003,
referred to as the Three-Year Facility. The other 2000 Facility,
referred to as the 364-Day Facility, consists of a
$260.0 million, 364-day revolving credit facility
convertible into a term loan. The 364-Day Facility will
terminate on September 27, 2002, at which time loans
outstanding thereunder may be converted to a one-year term loan
with a maturity date of September 29, 2003, or, at the
request of Cadence and with the consent of members of the bank
group that wish to do so, the Facility may be extended for one
additional 364-day period with respect to the portion of the
364-Day Facility outstanding loans that a consenting bank holds.
For both of the 2000 Facilities, Cadence has the option to pay
interest based on LIBOR plus a spread of between 1.25% and
1.50%, based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant, or
the higher of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50% or
(ii) the prime rate. As a result, Cadence’s interest
expense associated with borrowings under the 2000 Facilities
will vary with market rates. In addition, commitment fees are
payable on the unused portion of the Three-Year Facility at
rates between 0.25% and 0.34% based on a pricing grid tied to a
financial covenant and on the unused portion of the 364-Day
Facility at a fixed rate of 0.225%. A utilization fee of 0.25%
is payable on amounts borrowed under the 364-Day Facility
whenever combined borrowings under the two 2000 Facilities
exceed $118.8 million. Cadence may not borrow under the
364-Day Facility at any time that any portion of the Three-Year
Facility remains unused. The 2000 Facilities contain certain
financial and other covenants, which must be maintained. The
financial covenants specify that Cadence must maintain a minimum
EBITDA of not less than $200.0 million. Additionally,
Cadence must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (the
ratio of EBITDA to the sum of (i) interest expense plus
(ii) 20% of funded debt plus (iii) taxes paid in cash
less (iv) capital lease payments) of not less than 1.5 to
1.0. Other covenants require Cadence to maintain a minimum
one-to-one ratio of current assets to current liabilities and a
maximum two-to-one funded debt to EBITDA ratio. From time to
time, Cadence borrows under the 2000 Facilities. At
December 29, 2001, there were no borrowings outstanding.



The table below presents the carrying value and
related weighted average interest rates for Cadence’s
interest bearing instruments. All highly liquid investments with
an original maturity of three months or less at the date of
purchase are considered to be cash equivalents; investments with
original maturities between three and 12 months are
considered to be short-term investments. Investments with
original maturities greater than 12 months are considered
long-term investments. As of December 29, 2001, all of
Cadence’s investments have maturities of less than
12 months. The carrying value approximated fair value at
December 29, 2001.

Foreign Currency Risk

Cadence’s operations include transactions in
foreign currencies and, as such, Cadence benefits from a weaker
dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative
to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, the primary effect
of foreign currency transactions on Cadence’s results of
operations is a reduction in revenue from a strengthening
U.S. dollar, offset by a smaller reduction in expenses.

Cadence enters into foreign currency forward
exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect
against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets
and liabilities. A foreign currency forward exchange contract
acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying asset
exposures decrease in value or underlying liability exposures
increase in value. Conversely, a foreign currency forward
exchange contract decreases in value when underlying asset
exposures increase in value or underlying liability exposures
decrease in value. Forward contracts are not accounted for as
hedges and, therefore, the unrealized gains and losses are
recognized in other income, net in advance of the actual foreign
currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward
contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities.

Cadence also purchases foreign currency put
options from financial institutions to hedge the currency
exchange risks associated with probable but not firmly committed
transactions. Although there were no foreign currency put
options outstanding in 2001, Cadence may choose to use put
options in the future. A foreign currency put option acts as a
hedge by increasing in value as the underlying transactional
value decreases. Probable but not firmly committed transactions
consist of revenue from Cadence’s products and maintenance
contracts in a currency other than the functional currency.
These transactions are made through Cadence’s subsidiaries
in Ireland and Japan. The premium costs of the put options are
recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets while the
gains and losses are deferred and recognized in income in the
same period as the hedged transaction. Gains and losses on
accounting hedges realized before the settlement date of the
related hedged transaction are also generally deferred and
recognized in income in the same period as the hedged
transaction.

Cadence does not use forward contracts and put
options for trading purposes. Cadence’s ultimate realized
gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend
on the currency exchange rates in effect as the forward
contracts and put options mature.



The table below provides information as of
December 29, 2001 about Cadence’s forward foreign
currency contracts. As of December 29, 2001, there were no
put options outstanding. The information is provided in U.S.
dollar equivalent amounts. The table presents the notional
amounts, at contract exchange rates, and the weighted average
contractual foreign currency exchange rates. These forward
contracts mature prior to March 14, 2002.

While Cadence actively manages its foreign
currency risks on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance
that Cadence’s foreign currency hedging activities will
substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency
exchange rates on its results of operations, cash flows and
financial position. On a net basis, foreign currency
fluctuations did not have a material impact on Cadence’s
results of operations and financial position during the year
ended December 29, 2001. The realized gain (loss) on
the forward contracts as they matured was not material to the
consolidated operations of Cadence.

Equity Price Risk

Cadence repurchases shares of its common stock
under its stock repurchase program. Repurchased shares may be
used for general corporate purposes including the share issuance
requirements of Cadence’s employee stock option and
purchase plans and acquisitions. As part of this repurchase
programs, Cadence has purchased and will purchase call options
or has sold and will sell put warrants to mitigate equity price
risk associate with its stock repurchase program. The put
warrants, if exercised and settled by physical delivery of
shares, would entitle the holder to sell shares of Cadence
common stock to Cadence at a specified price. Similarly, the
call options entitle Cadence to buy shares of Cadence common
stock at a specified price. Cadence has the option to elect
“net share settlement”, rather than physical
settlement, of put warrants that are exercised; that is, Cadence
has the right to settle the exercised put warrants with shares
of Cadence common stock valued at the difference between the
exercise price and the fair value of the stock at the date of
exercise. These transactions may result in sales of a large
number of shares and consequent decline in the market price of
Cadence common stock. Cadence’s stock repurchase program
includes the following characteristics:

•

Call options allow Cadence to buy shares of its
	common stock on a specified day at a specified price. If the
	market price of the stock is greater than the exercise price of
	a call option, Cadence will typically exercise the option and
	receive shares of its stock. If the market price of the common
	stock is less than the exercise price of a call option, Cadence
	typically will not exercise the option.

•

Call option issuers may accumulate a substantial
	number of shares of Cadence common stock in anticipation of
	Cadence’s exercising its call option and may dispose of
	these shares if and when Cadence fails to exercise its call
	option. This could cause the market price of Cadence common
	stock to fall.



•

Depending on the exercise price of the put
	warrants and the market price of Cadence common stock at the
	time of exercise, “net share settlement” of the put
	warrants with Cadence common stock could cause Cadence to issue
	a substantial number of shares to the holder of the put warrant.
	The holder may sell these shares in the open market, which could
	cause the price of Cadence common stock to fall.

•

Put warrant holders may accumulate a substantial
	number of shares of Cadence common stock in anticipation of
	exercising their put warrants and may dispose of these shares if
	and when they exercise their put warrants and Cadence issues
	shares in settlement of their put warrants. This could also
	cause the market price of Cadence common stock to fall.

The table below provides information as of
December 29, 2001 about Cadence’s outstanding put
warrants and call options. The table presents the contract
amounts and the weighted average strike prices. The put warrants
and call options expire on various dates through May 2002 and
Cadence has the contractual ability to settle the options prior
to their maturity.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

At December 29, 2001, Cadence’s
principal sources of liquidity consisted of $274.8 million
of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments,
compared to $137.0 million at December 30, 2000, and
two syndicated senior unsecured credit facilities totaling
$360.0 million. As of December 29, 2001, Cadence had
no outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities.

Cash provided by operating activities increased
$107.1 million to $250.9 million at December 29,
2001 as compared to the year ended December 30, 2000,
primarily due to higher net income before depreciation and
amortization and unusual items in 2001.

At December 29, 2001, Cadence had net
working capital of $162.5 million, as compared with
$65.3 million at December 30, 2000. The working
capital increase was driven primarily by increases in cash and
cash equivalents of $121.1 million, short-term investments
of $16.7 million and a decrease in accounts payable and
accrued liabilities of $14.6 million, partially offset by a
decrease in net receivables of $31.1 million and prepaid
expenses and other of $26.7 million.

In addition to its short-term investments,
Cadence’s primary investing activities in 2001 consisted of
acquisitions and the related acquired intangibles, purchases of
property, plant and equipment, capitalization of software
development costs and venture capital partnership investments,
which combined represented $212.1 million at
December 29, 2001, compared to $183.7 million at
December 30, 2000 of cash used for investing activities.

Cadence sells put warrants and purchases call
options through private placements. See “Disclosures about
Market Risk — Equity Price Risk” above. At
December 29, 2001, Cadence had a maximum potential
obligation related to put warrants to buy back 2.9 million
shares of its common stock at an aggregate price of
approximately $61.2 million. These put warrants expire at
various dates through May 2002 and Cadence has the contractual
ability to settle the put warrants and call options prior to
their maturity. Cadence has the



ability to settle these put warrants with its
stock and, therefore, no amount was classified out of
stockholders’ equity in Cadence’s Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

Cadence has made permanent investments of assets
including cash in foreign countries, for which no U.S. tax has
been provided. At December 29, 2001, the cumulative amount
of earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided
are $501.0 million. At December 29, 2001, the
unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings was
$84.7 million.

Cadence has entered into agreements whereby it
may transfer qualifying accounts receivables, for which Cadence
has recognized the related revenue, to certain financing
institutions on a non-recourse basis. These transfers are
recorded as sales and accounted for in accordance with SFAS
No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities.”
During the fiscal years ended December 29, 2001 and
December 30, 2000, Cadence transferred accounts receivable
totaling $235.8 million and $201.2 million,
respectively, which approximated fair value, to financing
institutions on a non-recourse basis. Transfers of accounts
receivable for cash are reported in Cadence’s Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows as a financing activity.

Cadence also purchased $299.0 million of its
stock and reissued $99.9 million of stock through its
employee option and stock purchase programs.

As part of its overall investment strategy,
Cadence is a limited partner in Telos LP, a venture capital
fund, and is committed to invest up to $100.0 million. As
of December 29, 2001, Cadence had contributed approximately
$76.4 million to the fund, net of operating expenses.

On September 29, 2000, Cadence entered into
two syndicated, senior unsecured credit facilities that allow
Cadence to borrow up to $360.0 million. These two credit
facilities are referred to as the 2000 Facilities. One of the
2000 Facilities is a $100.0 million three-year revolving
credit facility that terminates on September 29, 2003,
referred to as the Three-Year Facility. The other 2000 Facility,
referred to as the 364-Day Facility, consists of a
$260.0 million, 364-day revolving credit facility
convertible into a term loan. The 364-Day Facility will
terminate on September 27, 2002, at which time loans
outstanding thereunder may be converted to a one-year term loan
with a maturity date of September 29, 2003, or, at the
request of Cadence and with the consent of members of the bank
group that wish to do so, the Facility may be extended for one
additional 364-day period with respect to the portion of the
364-Day Facility outstanding loans that a consenting bank holds.
For both of the 2000 Facilities, Cadence has the option to pay
interest based on LIBOR plus a spread of between 1.25% and
1.50%, based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant, or
the higher of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50% or
(ii) the prime rate. As a result, Cadence’s interest
expense associated with borrowings under the 2000 Facilities
will vary with market rates. In addition, commitment fees are
payable on the unused portion of the Three-Year Facility at
rates between 0.25% and 0.34% based on a pricing grid tied to a
financial covenant and on the unused portion of the 364-Day
Facility at a fixed rate of 0.225%. A utilization fee of 0.25%
is payable on amounts borrowed under the 364-Day Facility
whenever combined borrowings under the two 2000 Facilities
exceed $118.8 million. Cadence may not borrow under the
364-Day Facility at any time that any portion of the Three-Year
Facility remains unused. The 2000 Facilities contain certain
financial and other covenants, which must be maintained. The
financial covenants specify that Cadence must maintain a minimum
EBITDA of not less than $200.0 million. Additionally,
Cadence must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (the
ratio of EBITDA to the sum of (i) interest expense plus
(ii) 20% of funded debt plus (iii) taxes paid in cash
less (iv) capital lease payments) of not less than 1.5 to
1.0. Other covenants require Cadence to maintain a minimum
one-to-one ratio of current assets to current liabilities and a
maximum two-to-one funded debt to EBITDA ratio. From time to
time, Cadence borrows under the 2000 Facilities.

Cadence anticipates that current cash and
short-term investment balances, cash flow from operations, and
its $360.0 million revolving credit facilities will be
sufficient to meet its working capital and capital requirements
on a short-and long-term basis.



New Accounting Standards

In August 2001, the FASB, issued SFAS,
No. 143, “Accounting for Obligations Associated with
the Retirement of Long-Lived Assets.” SFAS No. 143
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the retirement
obligation of an asset. This statement provides that companies
should recognize the asset retirement cost at its fair value as
part of the cost of the asset and classify the accrued amount as
a liability in the condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The
asset retirement liability is then accreted to the ultimate
payout as interest expense. The initial measurement of the
liability would be subsequently updated for revised estimates of
the discounted cash outflows. The Statement will be effective
for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. Cadence has
not yet determined the effect SFAS No. 143 will have on its
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” SFAS
No. 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for
acquired goodwill and other acquired assets. It addresses how
intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group
of other assets (but not those acquired in a business
combination) should be accounted for in financial statements
upon their acquisition. This Statement also addresses how
goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for
after they have been initially recognized in the financial
statements. With the adoption of this Statement, goodwill is no
longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life.
Goodwill will be assessed for impairment each year using the
fair-value-based test. This Statement becomes effective
January 1, 2002. Cadence is currently analyzing the impact
of SFAS 142 and expects to complete its analysis by the end
of its fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2002. As of
December 29, 2001, Cadence had existing net goodwill and
identifiable assets of $396.3 million. Cadence expects that
upon adoption of SFAS 142, Cadence would no longer record
annual fiscal year amortization associated with existing
goodwill of approximately $311.0 million.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141,
“Business Combinations.” SFAS No. 141 addresses
financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and
it requires business combinations in the scope of this Statement
to be accounted for using one method, the purchase method. The
provisions of this Statement apply to all business combinations
initiated after June 30, 2001. The adoption of this
Statement did not have a material effect of Cadence’s
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC
ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of
Cadence Design Systems, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (a Delaware
corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 29, 2001 and
December 30, 2000, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each
of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 29,
2001. These financial statements and the schedule referred to
below are the responsibility of Cadence’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
consolidated financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Cadence Design Systems, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 29, 2001 and
December 30, 2000, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the
period ended December 29, 2001, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

Our audits were made for the purpose of forming
an opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a whole.
The schedule listed in Item 14.(a)2. is presented for
purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s rules and is not part of the basic
consolidated financial statements. This schedule has been
subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the
basic consolidated financial statements and, in our opinion,
fairly states in all material respects the financial data
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

CADENCE

Cadence Design Systems, Inc. provides
comprehensive software and other technology and offers design
and methodology services for the product development
requirements of the world’s leading electronics companies.
Cadence® licenses its leading-edge electronic design
automation software and hardware technology and provides a range
of services to companies throughout the world to help optimize
their product development processes. Cadence’s products and
services are used by companies to design and develop complex
integrated circuits and electronic systems, including
semiconductors, computer systems and peripherals,
telecommunications and networking equipment, mobile and wireless
devices, automotive electronics, consumer products and other
advanced electronics. These industries are experiencing a
general economic slowdown. This slowdown led Cadence to record
in 2001 worldwide restructuring and asset impairment charges
totaling $61.6 million, inventory write downs of
$18.9 million and acquired intangibles write-offs of
$25.8 million.

On July 17, 2000, Cadence announced its plan
to separate its electronics design services group into a new
company named Tality Corporation. Tality filed a registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for
Tality’s IPO. Tality’s separation from Cadence was
substantially completed on October 4, 2000, and the
electronic design services business thereafter operated as a
subsidiary of Cadence. As a result of the separation in the
third quarter of 2000, Cadence recorded deferred stock
compensation resulting from Tality option grants and sales of
Tality restricted stock. On October 9, 2000, Cadence
announced the postponement of Tality’s IPO due to
unfavorable market conditions. As a result of the postponement
of the Tality IPO, Cadence wrote off $2.8 million of
IPO-related expenses in the first quarter of 2001. In addition
to the $2.8 million, Cadence also expensed
$2.0 million of Tality separation costs in 2001, related
primarily to information systems separation, legal and
consulting fees. On April 17, 2001, Cadence announced the
withdrawal of the Tality IPO registration statement. Tality was
reorganized and restructured during the second, third and fourth
quarters of 2001, and is currently a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Cadence. See “Restructuring, Asset Impairment and Unusual
Items.”

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

Principles
of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Cadence and its subsidiaries after elimination of
intercompany accounts and transactions. Investments in companies
in which ownership interests range from 20% to 50% are accounted
for using the equity method of accounting. Cadence has one
investment with ownership interest less than 20% which is
accounted for using the equity method of accounting due to the
fact Cadence has significant influence on this investment.

Cadence’s fiscal year end is the Saturday
closest to December 31. Certain prior year consolidated
financial statement balances have been reclassified to conform
to the 2001 presentation.

Use
of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign
Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries,
where the functional currency is the local currency, are
translated using exchange rates in effect at the end of the
period and revenue and costs are translated using average
exchange rates for the period. Gains and losses on the
translation into U.S. dollars of amounts denominated in
foreign currencies are included in net income (loss) for
those operations whose functional currency is the
U.S. dollar, and as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders’
equity for those operations whose functional currency is the
local currency.

Derivative
Financial Instruments

Cadence enters into foreign currency forward
exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect
against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets
and liabilities. A foreign currency forward exchange contract
acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying asset
exposures decrease in value or underlying liability exposures
increase in value. Conversely, a foreign currency forward
exchange contract decreases in value when underlying asset
exposures increase in value or underlying liability exposures
decrease in value. Forward contracts are not accounted for as
hedges and, therefore, the unrealized gains and losses are
recognized in other income, net in advance of the actual foreign
currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward
contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities.

Cadence also purchases foreign currency put
options from financial institutions to hedge the currency
exchange risks associated with probable but not firmly committed
transactions. Although there were no foreign currency put
options outstanding in 2001, Cadence may choose to use put
options in the future. A foreign currency put option acts as a
hedge by increasing in value as the underlying transactional
value decreases. Probable but not firmly committed transactions
consist of revenue from Cadence’s products and maintenance
contracts in a currency other than the functional currency.
These transactions are made through Cadence’s subsidiaries
in Ireland and Japan. The premium costs of the put options are
recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets while the
gains and losses are deferred and recognized in income in the
same period as the hedged transaction. Gains and losses on
accounting hedges realized before the settlement date of the
related hedged transaction are also generally deferred and
recognized in income in the same period as the hedged
transaction.

Cadence does not use forward contracts and put
options for trading purposes. Cadence’s ultimate realized
gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend
on the currency exchange rates in effect as the forward
contracts and put options mature.

Revenue
Recognition

Cadence derives revenue from three sources:
(i) product revenue, which includes software licensing and
hardware sales, (ii) maintenance revenue from software and
hardware and (iii) services revenue. As described below,
significant management judgments and estimates are made and used
to determine the revenue recognized in any accounting period.

Cadence applies the provisions of Statement of
Position 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition,” as
amended by Statement of Position 98-9 “Modification of
SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to
Certain Transactions” to all transactions involving the
sale of software products and, sales of hardware where the
software is not incidental.

Cadence recognizes product revenue when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has
been delivered, the fee is fixed and determinable, collection of
the resulting receivable is probable and vendor specific
objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee among all
delivered and undelivered elements in the arrangement. Vendor
specific objective evidence of fair value is defined as the
value of each element of an



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)

December 29, 2001

arrangement if sold separately and is established
when a software vendor demonstrates a history of having sold the
element separately and of collecting on that element from a
representative sample of arrangements on a consistent basis. If
vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist
for all elements to support the allocation of the total fee
among all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement,
revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist for the
undelivered elements, or until all elements are delivered,
whichever is earlier.

Cadence sells software using three license types.
These license types are:

•

Term licenses — software licensed for a
	specific time period, generally two to three years, with no
	rights to return or exchange the licensed software;

•

Subscription licenses — software
	licensed for a specific time period, generally two to three
	years, with no rights to return and limited rights to exchange
	the licensed software for unspecified future technology; and

•

Perpetual licenses — software licensed
	on a perpetual basis with no right to return or exchange the
	licensed software.

For term and subscription licenses, Cadence uses
a signed contract as evidence of an arrangement. For perpetual
licenses, hardware sales and maintenance renewals Cadence uses a
purchase order as evidence of an arrangement. Sales through its
Japanese distributor are evidenced by a master agreement
governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders
on a transaction-by-transaction basis. For services, Cadence
uses a signed statement of work to evidence an arrangement.

Software is delivered to customers electronically
or on a CD-ROM. With respect to hardware, delivery of an entire
system is deemed to occur upon installation.

Cadence assesses whether the fee is fixed and
determinable based on the payment terms associated with the
transaction. Cadence uses installment contracts for term
licenses and subscription licenses for which it has established
a history of collecting under the original contract without
providing concessions on payments, products or services. The
time periods of installment payment contracts are equal to or
less than the time period of the licenses and are generally
collected quarterly.

Cadence assesses collectibility based on a number
of factors, including the customer’s past payment history
and its current credit-worthiness. If Cadence determines that
collection of a fee is not reasonably assured, Cadence defers
the revenue and recognizes it at the time collection becomes
reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash
payment.

Provided all the related conditions discussed
above are met, Cadence recognizes revenue for each software
license type as follows:

•

Term licenses and Perpetual licenses —
	revenue associated with delivered software is recognized upon
	the effective date of the license; and

•

Subscription licenses — revenue
	associated with delivered software is recognized ratably over
	the term of the license commencing upon the effective date of
	the license.

Maintenance revenue consists of fees for
providing technical support and software updates. Cadence
recognizes all maintenance revenue ratably over the contract
term regardless of the software license agreement type. For term
and perpetual licenses, customers renew maintenance agreements
annually.

Services revenue consists primarily of revenue
received for performing methodology and design services.
Fixed-price methodology and design service contracts are
accounted for using contract accounting, which is generally the
percentage-of-completion method rather than the
completed-contract method, and time and materials contracts are
accounted for on a monthly basis as work is performed. In
addition, for small fixed-



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)

December 29, 2001

price-projects, such as training classes and
small, standard methodology service engagements of approximately
$10,000 in size or less, revenue is recognized when the work is
completed.

Deferred
Revenue

Deferred revenue arises when customers are billed
for products and/or services in advance of their being provided
and therefore earned. Cadence’s deferred revenue consists
primarily of billing to customers for software maintenance and
subscription product licenses made in advance of the period over
which the maintenance and/or software license will be provided.
Maintenance on perpetual licenses is generally renewed annually
and is billed in advance. The revenue is deferred and earned
ratably over the 12 month renewal period. Subscription
licensed product and maintenance billing is generally billed
quarterly in advance. The revenue is deferred and recognized
ratably over the ensuing quarter.

Comprehensive
Income

Comprehensive income includes foreign currency
translation gains and losses and other unrealized gains and
losses that have been previously excluded from net income
(loss) and reflected instead in stockholders’ equity.
Cadence has reported the components of comprehensive income on
its consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity.

Cash,
Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

Cadence considers all highly liquid debt
instruments, including commercial paper, euro time deposits,
repurchase agreements and certificates of deposit with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. Investments with original maturities greater than
three months and less than one year are classified as short-term
investments. Investments with original maturities greater than
one year are classified as long-term investments.

Management determines the appropriate
classification of its investments at the time of purchase.
Securities classified as held-to-maturity are stated at
amortized cost based on Cadence’s positive intent to hold
such securities until maturity. The cost of securities sold is
determined using the specific identification method when
computing realized gains and losses. Securities classified as
available-for-sale are stated at fair value, with the unrealized
gains and losses reported as a component of stockholders’
equity until realized. The amortized cost of debt securities is
adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts
to maturity. Such amortization and accretion is included in
other income, net.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
(using the first-in, first-out method) or market. Cadence’s
inventories include high technology parts and components for
complex computer systems that emulate the performance and
operation of computer IC and electronic systems. These parts and
components may be specialized in nature or subject to rapid
technological obsolescence. While Cadence has programs to
minimize the required inventories on hand and considers
technological obsolescence when estimating required reserves to
reduce recorded amounts to market values, it is reasonably
possible that such estimates could change in the near term.

In the year ended December 29, 2001, Cadence
recorded an $18.9 million reserve against inventory in cost
of product in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of the
$18.9 million reserve, $15.2 million was related to
excess inventory from revised sales forecasts and
$3.7 million related to two product lines that were
discontinued as part of Cadence’s restructuring. The excess
inventory charge of $15.2 million was due to a sudden and
significant decrease in forecasted revenue for emulation
products and was calculated in accordance with Cadence’s
policy, which is based on inventory in excess of 12-month
demand. Inventory purchases and



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)

December 29, 2001

commitments are based on future sales forecasts.
Cadence typically buys and builds inventory levels for certain
key components to mitigate component supply constraints. Based
on Cadence’s current 12-month demand forecast, Cadence does
not anticipate that the excess inventory subject to these
reserves will be used at a later date.

Property, Plant
and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost.
Depreciation and amortization are provided over the estimated
useful lives, using the straight-line method, as follows:

Computer equipment and related software

3-8 years

Buildings

10-32 years

Leasehold and building improvements

Shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful
	life

Furniture and fixtures

3-5 years

Equipment

3-5 years

Cadence capitalizes the costs of software
developed for internal use in compliance with Statement of
Position 98-1 “Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use” and with
Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 00-2 “Accounting for
Web Site Development Costs”. Capitalization of software
developed for internal use and web site development costs begins
at the application development phase of the project.
Amortization of software developed for internal use and web site
development costs begins when the products are placed in
productive use, and is computed on a straight-line basis over
the estimated useful life of the product.

Cadence recorded depreciation expense of
property, plant and equipment for the fiscal years ended
December 29, 2001, December 30, 2000, and
January 1, 2000 in the amount of $83.2 million,
$76.7 million and $68.0 million, respectively.

Software
Development Costs and Acquired Intangibles

Cadence capitalizes software development costs in
compliance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or
SFAS, No. 86, “Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed.”
Capitalization of software development costs begins upon the
establishment of technological feasibility of the product.
Technological feasibility is established at the completion of
detail program design and testing. The establishment of
technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment of the
recoverability of these costs requires considerable judgment by
management with respect to certain external factors including,
but not limited to, anticipated future gross product revenue,
estimated economic life and changes in software and hardware
technology. Amortization of capitalized software development
costs begins when the products are available for general release
to customers and is computed on a straight-line basis over the
remaining estimated economic life of the product, which is
generally three years.

Cadence recorded amortization expense for
software development costs for the fiscal years ended
December 29, 2001, December 30, 2000 and
January 1, 2000 in the amount of $29.0 million,
$28.4 million and $26.6 million, respectively.

Acquired intangibles represent purchase price in
excess of acquired tangible assets and in-process technology in
connection with business combinations accounted for as purchases
and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining
estimated economic life of the underlying products and
technologies (original lives assigned are five to seven years).

Cadence is currently analyzing the impact of
SFAS 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”,
and expects to complete its analysis by the end of its fiscal
quarter ended March 30, 2002. As part of the adoption



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)

December 29, 2001

of SFAS No. 142, Cadence would no longer
amortize goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives.
Cadence expects that, upon adoption of SFAS 142, Cadence
would no longer record annual fiscal year amortization
associated with existing goodwill of approximately
$311.0 million.

Long-lived
Assets

Cadence periodically reviews long-lived assets,
certain identifiable intangibles and goodwill related to these
assets for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 121,
“Accounting for the Impairment of Long-lived Assets and For
Long-lived Assets to be Disposed Of.”

For assets to be held and used, including
acquired intangibles, Cadence initiates its review whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its
carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows
(without interest charges) that the asset is expected to
generate. Any impairment to be recognized is measured by the
amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its
fair market value.

Assets to be disposed of and for which management
has committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, whether
through sale or abandonment, are reported at the lower of
carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Advertising

Cadence expenses the production costs of
advertising as incurred. Advertising expense was approximately
$19.3 million, $22.9 million and $15.7 million
for the fiscal years ended 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively,
and is included in marketing and sales in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Concentrations
of Credit Risk

Financial instruments, including derivative
financial instruments, that may potentially subject Cadence to
concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash
investments, short-term investments, long-term investments,
accounts receivable, forward contracts and put options and call
options purchased in conjunction with Cadence’s stock
repurchase programs. Cadence’s investment policy limits
investments to short-term, low-risk instruments. Concentration
of credit risk related to accounts receivable is limited, due to
the varied customers comprising Cadence’s customer base and
their dispersion across geographies. Credit exposure related to
the forward contracts and the call options is limited to the
realized and unrealized gains on these contracts. All financial
instruments are executed with financial institutions with strong
credit ratings, which minimizes risk of loss due to nonpayment.
Cadence has not experienced any losses due to credit impairment
related to its financial instruments.

New Accounting
Standards

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS,
No. 143, “Accounting for Obligations Associated with
the Retirement of Long-Lived Assets.” SFAS No. 143
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the retirement
obligation of an asset. This statement provides that companies
should recognize the asset retirement cost at its fair value as
part of the cost of the asset and classify the accrued amount as
a liability in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The
asset retirement liability is then accreted to the ultimate
payout as interest expense. The initial measurement of the
liability would be subsequently updated for revised estimates of
the discounted cash outflows. The Statement will be effective
for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. Cadence has
not yet determined the effect SFAS No. 143 will have on its
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)

December 29, 2001

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142.
SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting
for acquired goodwill and other acquired assets. It addresses
how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a
group of other assets (but not those acquired in a business
combination) should be accounted for in financial statements
upon their acquisition. This Statement also addresses how
goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for
after they have been initially recognized in the financial
statements. With the adoption of this Statement, goodwill is no
longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life.
Goodwill will be assessed for impairment each year using the
fair-value-based test. This Statement becomes effective
January 1, 2002. Cadence is currently analyzing the impact
of SFAS 142 and expects to complete its analysis by the end
of its fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2002. As of
December 29, 2001, Cadence had existing net goodwill and
identifiable assets of $396.3 million. Cadence expects that
upon adoption of SFAS 142, Cadence would no longer record
annual fiscal year amortization associated with existing
goodwill of approximately $311.0 million.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141,
“Business Combinations.” SFAS No. 141 addresses
financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and
it requires business combinations in the scope of this Statement
to be accounted for using one method, the purchase method. The
provisions of this Statement apply to all business combinations
initiated after June 30, 2001. The adoption of this
Statement did not have a material effect of Cadence’s
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Investments

The following tables summarize Cadence’s
investment activities as of December 29, 2001 and
December 30, 2000:

Cadence’s marketable securities
available-for-sale are carried at market value and unrealized
gains, net of taxes, are in other comprehensive income. Net
realized gains on marketable securities were $17.7 million
and $14.3 million for the years ended December 29,
2001 and December 30, 2000, respectively. There were no
realized gains or losses for the year ended January 1,
2000. As of December 30, 2000, the unrealized gain on the
corporate debt security was negligible.

Cadence’s non-marketable securities are
carried at the lower of cost or market of net realizable value
and are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.

Since 1996, Cadence has made venture capital
investments through Telos Venture Partners, LP, or
Telos LP, a venture capital firm independently managed by
Telos Management, LLC, or Telos LLC, an entity in which
Cadence holds no ownership interest and which is not affiliated
with any Cadence director or executive officer. Cadence and the
Cadence 1996 Deferred Compensation Venture Investment Plan are
the

sole limited partners of Telos LP. The total
capital commitment by Cadence to Telos LP is $100 million,
of which Cadence had contributed $76.4 million as of
December 29, 2001. Undistributed investments in Telos LP
are included in non-marketable securities.

Financing

Cadence has entered into agreements whereby it
may transfer qualifying accounts receivables, for which Cadence
has recognized the related revenue, to certain financing
institutions on a non-recourse basis. These transfers are
recorded as sales and accounted for in accordance with SFAS
No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities.”
During the fiscal years ended December 29, 2001 and
December 30, 2000, Cadence transferred accounts receivable
totaling $235.8 million and $201.2 million,
respectively, which approximated fair value, to financing
institutions on a non-recourse basis. Transfers of accounts
receivable for cash are reported in Cadence’s consolidated
statements of cash flows as a financing activity.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The following table shows the notional principal
and fair value of Cadence’s derivative financial
instruments as of December 29, 2001 and December 30,
2000:

The estimates of fair value are based on
applicable and commonly used pricing models using prevailing
financial market information as of December 29, 2001 and
December 30, 2000. As of December 29, 2001 and
December 30, 2000, the credit risk associated with the
forward contracts and put options was negligible. Although the
table above reflects the notional principal and fair value
amounts of Cadence’s foreign exchange instruments, it does
not reflect the gains or losses associated with the underlying
exposures and underlying transactions. The amounts ultimately
realized upon settlement of these financial instruments,
together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures,
will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining
life of the instruments.

ACQUISITIONS

Silicon Perspective Corporation

In December 2001, Cadence acquired Silicon
Perspective®Corporation, or SPC, a privately-held design
technology firm for approximately 6.8 million shares of
Cadence common stock, valued at $132.5 million.
SPC provides electronic design tools that bridge the gap
between front-end logic designers and the back-end physical
design process. The purchase price could increase if certain
predetermined performance goals are achieved in fiscal 2002 and
2003. In connection with the acquisition, Cadence preliminarily
allocated the purchase price primarily to goodwill of
$97.9 million and technology, trademarks, employee
agreements and other assumed contractual obligations intangibles
of $19.5 million. The technology and other acquired
intangibles are being amortized over one to five years.

Upon consummation of the SPC acquisition, Cadence
immediately charged to expense $8.6 million representing
acquired in-process technology that had not yet reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The
value assigned to acquired in-process technology was determined
by identifying



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)

December 29, 2001

research projects in areas for which
technological feasibility has not been established. The value
was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired
in-process technology into commercially viable products,
estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and
discounting the net cash flows back to their present value. The
discount rate included a factor that took into account the
uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the
acquired in-process technology. The in-process technology is
expected to be commercially viable in 2002. As of
December 29, 2001, expenditures to complete the in-process
technology have totaled $1.2 million and expenditures to
complete the remaining in-process technology are expected to
total approximately $0.7 million. These estimates are
subject to change, given the uncertainties of the development
process, and no assurance can be given that deviations from
these estimates will not occur. Additionally, these projects
will require additional research and development after they have
reached a state of technological and commercial feasibility.

Comparative pro forma financial information has
not been presented because the results of operations of SPC were
not material to Cadence’s consolidated financial
statements, either individually or in the aggregate.

Other Acquisitions

In the three months ended June 30, 2001,
Cadence acquired substantially all of the assets of two
companies for a preliminary aggregate price of
$10.5 million, of which $4.4 million was cash and
$6.1 million was shares of Cadence stock, plus future
contingent payments. Each acquisition was accounted for as a
purchase. Upon consummation of the acquisitions, Cadence
immediately charged to expense $1.0 million representing
acquired in-process technology that had not yet reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative future use.

CadMOS Design Technology, Inc.

In February 2001, Cadence acquired CadMOS Design
Technology, Inc., a privately-held design tools firm for
approximately 3.6 million shares of Cadence common stock,
valued at $92.7 million, and the acquisition was accounted
for as a purchase. CadMOS provides solutions to the noise
problems experienced in ultra-deep submicron processes. The
purchase price will increase up to an additional
488,970 shares if certain predetermined performance goals
are achieved over the three years following the acquisition.
These goals are bookings, product development and continued
employment of certain CadMOS employees. In connection with the
acquisition, Cadence preliminarily allocated the purchase price
primarily to goodwill of $58.3 million and technology and
other intangibles of $12.9 million. The technology and
other acquired intangibles are being amortized over three to
five years. The results of operations of CadMOS and the
estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed are included in Cadence’s consolidated financial
statements from the date of acquisition.

Upon consummation of the CadMOS acquisition,
Cadence immediately charged to expense $12.1 million
representing acquired in-process technology that had not yet
reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future
use. See “Restructuring, Asset Impairment and Unusual
Items.” The value assigned to acquired in-process
technology was determined by identifying research projects in
areas for which technological feasibility has not been
established. The value was determined by estimating the costs to
develop the acquired in-process technology into commercially
viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from
such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their
present value. The discount rate included a factor that took
into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful
development of the acquired in-process technology. The
in-process technology is expected to be commercially viable in
2002. As of December 29, 2001, expenditures to complete the
in-process technology have totaled $1.0 million and
expenditures to complete the remaining in-process technology are
expected to total approximately $0.9 million. These
estimates are subject to change, given the uncertainties of the
development process, and no assurance can be given that
deviations from these estimates will not occur. Additionally,
these projects will

require additional research and development after
they have reached a state of technological and commercial
feasibility.

Comparative pro forma financial information has
not been presented because the results of operations of CadMOS
were not material to Cadence’s consolidated financial
statements, either individually or in the aggregate.

Diablo Research Company LLC

In December 1999, Cadence acquired all of the
outstanding stock of Diablo Research Company LLC for
$39.9 million in cash in a transaction accounted for as a
purchase. Diablo is a high-technology engineering services
company with expertise in wireless communication, global
positioning satellite solutions and data transfer and home
automation markets. In connection with the acquisition, Cadence
acquired intangibles of $40.9 million, which are being
amortized over three years. In 2001, Cadence recorded a charge
of $25.8 million related to the impairment of acquired
intangibles associated with Diablo. See “Restructuring,
Asset Impairment and Unusual Items — Acquired
Intangibles Write-Off.”

OrCAD, Inc.

In August 1999, Cadence acquired OrCAD, Inc., a
supplier of computer-aided engineering and computer-aided design
software and services for the printed circuit board industry,
for cash. Cadence acquired all of the outstanding stock of OrCAD
and assumed all outstanding stock options. The purchase price
was $131.4 million and the acquisition was accounted for as
a purchase. In connection with the acquisition, Cadence acquired
intangibles of $94.0 million. The results of operations of
OrCAD and the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed are included in Cadence’s consolidated
financial statements from the date of acquisition. Intangibles
arising from the OrCAD acquisition are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over five years.

Management estimated that $11.8 million of
the purchase price for OrCAD represented acquired in-process
technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility
and had no alternative future use. Accordingly, this amount was
immediately charged to expense in the consolidated statements of
operations upon consummation of the acquisition. The value
assigned to acquired in-process technology was determined by
identifying research projects in areas for which technological
feasibility had not been established. The value was determined
by estimating the costs to develop the acquired in-process
technology into commercially viable products, estimating the
resulting net cash flows from such projects, and discounting the
net cash flows back to their present value. The discount rate
included a factor that took into account the uncertainty
surrounding the successful development of the acquired
in-process technology. The acquired in-process technology became
commercially viable in 1999 and 2000.

Comparative pro forma financial information has
not been presented because the results of operations of Diablo
and OrCAD were not material to Cadence’s consolidated
financial statements, either individually or in the aggregate.

Quickturn Design
Systems, Inc.

In May 1999, Cadence completed its merger with
Quickturn Design Systems, Inc. Quickturn designs, manufactures,
sells and supports hardware and software products that verify
the design of computer chips and electronic systems. Cadence
acquired all of the outstanding shares of Quickturn common stock
in a stock-for-stock transaction for approximately
24.6 million shares of Cadence common stock. The
acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests. In
addition, Cadence assumed all outstanding stock options and
warrants of Quickturn. All prior period consolidated financial
statements were restated as if the merger took

place at the beginning of such periods in
accordance with required pooling of interests accounting and
disclosures.

Design
Acceleration, Inc.

In January 1999, Cadence acquired Design
Acceleration, Inc., or DAI, a supplier of design verification
technology used in system-on-a-chip design. Cadence acquired all
of the outstanding stock of DAI for approximately
0.6 million shares of Cadence common stock and
$2.9 million of cash. The total purchase price was
$25.7 million and the acquisition was accounted for as a
purchase. In connection with the acquisition, Cadence acquired
intangibles of $24.1 million. The results of operations of
DAI and the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed are included in Cadence’s consolidated
financial statements from the date of acquisition. Intangibles
arising from the acquisition are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over five years.

Management estimated that $8.9 million of
the purchase price for DAI represented acquired in-process
technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility
and had no alternative future use. Accordingly, this amount was
immediately charged to expense in the consolidated statements of
operations upon consummation of the acquisition. The value
assigned to acquired in-process technology was determined by
identifying research projects in areas for which technological
feasibility had not been established. The value was determined
by estimating the costs to develop the acquired in-process
technology into commercially viable products, estimating the
resulting net cash flows from such projects, and discounting the
net cash flows back to their present value. The discount rate
included a factor that took into account the uncertainty
surrounding the successful development of the purchased
in-process technology. The acquired in-process technology became
commercially viable in 2000.

Comparative pro forma financial information has
not been presented because the results of operations of DAI were
not material to Cadence’s consolidated financial statements.

CREDIT FACILITY

On September 29, 2000, Cadence entered into
two syndicated, senior unsecured credit facilities that allow
Cadence to borrow up to $360.0 million. These two credit
facilities are referred to as the 2000 Facilities. One of the
2000 Facilities is a $100.0 million three-year revolving
credit facility, which terminates on September 29, 2003,
referred to as the Three-Year Facility. The other 2000 Facility,
referred to as the 364-Day Facility, consists of a
$260.0 million, 364-day revolving credit facility
convertible into a term loan. The 364-Day Facility will
terminate on September 27, 2002, at which time loans
outstanding thereunder may be converted to a one-year term loan
with a maturity date of September 29, 2003, or, at the
request of Cadence and with the consent of members of the bank
group that wish to do so, the Facility may be extended for one
additional 364-day period with respect to the portion of the
364-Day Facility outstanding loans that a consenting bank holds.
For both of the 2000 Facilities, Cadence has the option to pay
interest based on LIBOR plus a spread of between 1.25% and
1.50%, based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant, or
the higher of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50% or
(ii) the prime rate. As a result, Cadence’s interest
expense associated with borrowings under the 2000 Facilities
will vary with market rates. In addition, commitment fees are
payable on the unused portion of the Three-Year Facility at
rates between 0.25% and 0.34% based on a pricing grid tied to a
financial covenant and on the unused portion of the 364-Day
Facility at a fixed rate of 0.225%. A utilization fee of 0.25%
is payable on amounts borrowed under the 364-Day Facility
whenever combined borrowings under the two 2000 Facilities
exceed $118.8 million. Cadence may not borrow under the
364-Day Facility at any time that any portion of the Three-Year
Facility remains unused. The 2000 Facilities contain certain
financial and other covenants, which must be maintained. The
financial covenants specify that Cadence must maintain a minimum
EBITDA of not less than $200.0 million. Additionally,
Cadence must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (the
ratio of EBITDA to the sum of (i) interest expense plus

December 29, 2001

(ii) 20% of funded debt plus
(iii) taxes paid in cash less (iv) capital lease
payments) of not less than 1.5 to 1.0. Other covenants require
Cadence to maintain a minimum one-to-one ratio of current assets
to current liabilities and a maximum two-to-one funded debt to
EBITDA ratio. From time to time, Cadence borrows amounts under
the 2000 Facilities. At December 29, 2001, there were no
borrowings outstanding.

COMMITMENTS

Equipment and facilities are leased under various
capital and operating leases expiring at various dates through
the year 2017. Certain of these leases contain renewal options.
Rental expense was $25.6 million for 2001,
$22.2 million for 2000 and $25.0 million for 1999.

Since 1996, Cadence has made venture capital
investments through Telos LP, a venture capital firm
independently managed by Telos LLC. The total capital commitment
by Cadence to Telos LP is $100 million, of which Cadence
had contributed $76.4 million as of December 29, 2001.

At December 29, 2001, future minimum lease
payments under capital and operating leases and the present
value of the capital lease payments were as follows:

The cost of equipment under capital leases
included in the consolidated balance sheets as property, plant
and equipment at December 29, 2001 and December 30,
2000 was approximately $6.0 million and $11.6 million,
respectively. Accumulated amortization of the leased equipment
at December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000 was
approximately $3.2 million and $6.2 million,
respectively.

CONTINGENCIES

From time to time, Cadence is involved in various
disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary
course of business. These include disputes and lawsuits related
to intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, licensing,
contract law, distribution arrangements and employee relations
matters.

Cadence filed a complaint in the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of California on
December 6, 1995 against Avant! Corporation and certain of
its employees or agents for misappropriation of trade secrets,
copyright infringement, conspiracy and other illegal acts
involving intellectual property.



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

December 29, 2001

On January 16, 1996, Avant! filed various
counterclaims against Cadence and Joseph B. Costello,
Cadence’s former President and Chief Executive Officer, and
with leave of the court, on January 29, 1998, filed a
second amended counterclaim. The second amended counterclaim
alleges, inter alia, that Cadence and Mr. Costello had
cooperated with the Santa Clara County, California, District
Attorney and initiated and pursued its complaint against Avant!
for anti-competitive reasons, engaged in wrongful activity in an
attempt to manipulate Avant!’s stock price, and utilized
certain pricing policies and other acts to unfairly compete
against Avant! in the marketplace. The second amended
counterclaim also alleges that certain Cadence insiders engaged
in illegal insider trading with respect to Avant!’s stock.
Cadence and Mr. Costello believe that they have meritorious
defenses to Avant!’s claims, and each intends to defend
such action vigorously. By an order dated July 13, 1996,
the court bifurcated Avant!’s counterclaim from
Cadence’s complaint and stayed the counterclaim pending
resolution of Cadence’s complaint. The counterclaim remains
stayed.

In an order issued on December 19, 1997, as
modified on January 26, 1998, the District Court entered a
preliminary injunction barring Avant! from any further
infringement of Cadence’s copyrights in Design Framework
II® software, or selling, licensing or copying such product
derived from Design Framework II, including, but not limited to,
Avant!’s ArcCell products. On December 7, 1998, the
District Court issued a further preliminary injunction, which
enjoined Avant! from selling its Aquarius product line. Cadence
posted a $10.0 million bond in connection with the issuance
of the preliminary injunction. On July 30, 1999, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the
preliminary injunction.

On July 25, 2001, Avant! was ordered to pay
Cadence $194.6 million in criminal restitution after Avant!
entered a plea of no contest and was found guilty by the
Superior Court of the State of California of conspiracy to take
and use Cadence’s trade secrets. This conspiracy included
the theft by Avant! and certain individuals of Cadence
intellectual property, including software code, as well as other
trade secrets. As of December 29, 2001, approximately
$196.0 million, consisting of all of the restitution award
plus interest was received. This amount is recorded in
restructuring, asset impairment and unusual items in
Cadence’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.

On September 7, 1999, the District Court
ruled on the parties’ Motions for Summary Adjudication, and
granted in part, and denied in part, each party’s motion
regarding the scope of a June 6, 1994 Release Agreement
between the parties. The court held that Cadence’s
copyright infringement claim against Avant! is not barred by the
release and that Cadence may proceed on that claim. The court
also held that Cadence’s trade secret claim based on
Avant!’s use, prior to June 1994, of Cadence’s
Design Framework II source code is barred by the release.
On May 15, 2001, the Ninth Circuit heard oral arguments by
both parties on their appeals from the District Court’s
order. On June 11, 2001, the Ninth Circuit certified a
question of California law to the California Supreme Court and
stayed the case. On October 31, 2001, the California
Supreme Court agreed to accept such certification.

In February 1998, Aptix Corporation and Meta
Systems, Inc. filed a lawsuit against Quickturn Design Systems,
Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District
of California alleging that Quickturn infringed a
U.S. patent owned by Aptix and licensed to Meta. In
June 2000, the District Court entered judgment in favor of
Quickturn, dismissing the complaint and declaring the patent
unenforceable. The Court also granted summary judgment to Aptix,
denying Quickturn’s abuse of process counterclaim. On
September 8, 2000 the Court ordered Aptix to pay
$4.2 million to Quickturn as reimbursement of
attorneys’ fees and costs it incurred in the litigation.
Aptix appealed the District’s Court’s judgment and
posted a $2.0 million bond to secure the judgment. On
June 8, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court’s dismissal of
Quickturn’s abuse of process counterclaim. On
November 5, 2001, the Federal Circuit vacated the District
Court’s judgment of unenforceability, but affirmed the
District Court’s dismissal of Aptix’s and Meta’s
complaint and the award of attorneys fees and costs.

On January 7, 1999, in a suit captioned
Mentor Graphics Corporation, et al. v. Lobo, et al.,
Delaware Chancery Court, New Castle County, Civ. Action
No. 16843-NC (“Mentor II”), Mentor filed and
served an amended complaint asserting claims against Cadence,
Quickturn and the Quickturn Board of Directors for declaratory
and injunctive relief for various alleged breaches of fiduciary
duty purportedly owned by Quickturn and its Board of Directors
to Quickturn’s shareholders in connection with the merger
between Quickturn and Cadence. Mentor further alleged that
Cadence aided and abetted Quickturn and its Board of Directors
in those purported breaches. Mentor has not prosecuted the
matter since January 1999. In May 2000, Mentor advised
the Delaware Chancery Court of its objection to the settlement
of a companion action brought on behalf of certain Quickturn
shareholders, and sought an award of attorneys’ fees
related to its prosecution of Mentor II as well as the
prior related action, to which Cadence was not a party.
Settlement of the companion action is conditioned upon approval
of the Chancery Court and Mentor’s not being awarded
attorneys’ fees for Mentor II. In an order dated
August 17, 2001, the Chancery Court denied Mentor’s
fee application. Mentor has indicated that it will appeal this
order.

On July 21, 1999, Mentor filed suit against
Quickturn, which action is pending in the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of California, Civil Action
No. C 99-5464. Mentor has alleged that Quickturn’s
Mercury

TM

and Mercury

TM

Plus hardware
emulation systems infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 5,777,489
and 5,790,832, allegedly assigned to Mentor. At Quickturn’s
request, Cadence was added as a party defendant. Quickturn and
Cadence are vigorously defending themselves against
Mentor’s claims, and have filed counterclaims for
declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity of these
patents.

On March 24, 2000, Mentor and Meta and
several founders of Meta filed suit against Quickturn and
Cadence and a former Quickturn employee in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California, Civil Action No. C-00-01030. The suit alleges
infringement of U.S. Patent No. 5,574,832 allegedly
assigned to Mentor, misappropriation of trade secrets and breach
of confidence, and seeks unspecified damages, injunctive relief
and the assignment to Mentor of a patent previously issued to
Quickturn. Quickturn and Cadence are vigorously defending
themselves against these claims, and have filed counterclaims
for declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity of
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,754,827, 5,999,725 and 6,057,706
allegedly assigned to Mentor.

On September 11, 2000, Mentor filed a
complaint against Quickturn and Cadence in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California, Civil Action No. C-00-03291, accusing Quickturn
and Cadence of infringing U.S. Patent No. 5,574,388,
purportedly owned by Mentor, and seeking unspecified damages and
injunctive relief. Cadence and Quickturn are vigorously
defending themselves against Mentor’s claim, and have filed
counterclaims for declaratory judgment of non-infringement and
of this patent. The parties have agreed to consolidate this
action with Civil Action Nos. C 99-5464 and
C 00-01030, described above, for purposes of discovery and
pre-trial motions. A trial date has been set for October 7,
2002. Meanwhile, on November 3, 2000, Mentor filed a motion
for preliminary injunction, asking the Court to prohibit the
sale of Quickturn’s MercuryPlus emulation systems prior to
trial of this action. The Court denied the motion for
preliminary injunction on August 30, 2001, stating that
Quickturn and Cadence had raised substantial questions regarding
the validity of U.S. Patent No. 5,574,388. However,
the Court also stated that Mentor had demonstrated likelihood of
success in proving that Quickturn’s MercuryPlus emulation
systems infringe Claims 1 and 5 of the patent. Mentor
subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment that
Quickturn’s MercuryPlus

TM

emulation system
infringes Claims 1 and 5 of U.S. Patent
No. 5,574,388. Mentor’s summary judgment motion will
be heard on March 22, 2002. Quickturn and Cadence believe
the Court will ultimately conclude that no such infringement
exists.

On November 2, 2000, Mentor and Meta filed a
complaint for declaratory judgment against Quickturn and Cadence
in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon (Case
No. C-00-1489) seeking a ruling that Mentor’s proposed
design verification approach (in which IC designers would use
U.S.-based computer terminals to operate SimExpress emulation
systems located overseas) will not infringe Quickturn’s
patents

and will not violate the permanent injunction
entered by the Oregon District Court on July 7, 1999 in
Civil Action No. C-96-00342. In January 2001,
Quickturn and Cadence filed a Motion to Dismiss the action,
based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On May 1,
2001, the Court provisionally granted Quickturn’s motion to
dismiss. Cadence and Quickturn believe that Mentor’s
complaint is without merit.

On April 30, 1999, Cadence and several of
its officers and directors were named as defendants in a lawsuit
filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District
of California, entitled Spett v. Cadence Design Systems,
et al., civil action no. C 99-2082. The action
was brought on behalf of a class of stockholders who purchased
Cadence common stock between November 4, 1998 and
April 20, 1999, and alleged violations of
Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. On September 18, 2000, the District Court granted
Cadence’s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ Claims with
leave to amend. Plantiffs did not amend their complaint and on
November 29, 2001, an order was filed dismissing the claims
with prejudice and granting judgment in favor of Cadence and the
individual defendants.

On February 25, 2000, Cadence and several of
its officers were named as defendants in a lawsuit filed in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California, entitled Maxick v. Cadence Design Systems, Inc.,
File No. C 00-0658PJH. The action was brought on behalf of
a class of shareholders of OrCAD, Inc., and alleges violations
of Section 14(d)(7) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
and Rule 14d-10 thereunder. The lawsuit arose out of
Cadence’s acquisition of OrCAD, which was completed in
August 1999. The parties have settled the matter for the payment
of $1.25 million by Cadence. The settlement is subject to
court approval.

In early 1999, Cadence entered into negotiations
with Intelect Communications, Inc. (since renamed TeraForce
Technology Corporation), and Intelect’s wholly-owned
subsidiary, DNA Enterprises, Inc., with respect to a potential
purchase of substantially all the assets of DNA. The transaction
was not consummated and, in July 1999, Intelect and DNA
filed suit against Cadence in a Texas state court alleging
breach of contract, fraud, negligent misrepresentation and
breach of fiduciary duty, seeking unspecified compensatory and
punitive damages. Cadence has answered, denying liability. In
January 2002, the court denied Cadence’s motion for Partial
Summary Judgment and set a trial for March 2002.

On November 22, 2000, a former design
services customer, Uniden Corporation, filed an action for
fraud, negligent misrepresentation and breach of contract in the
State Court of Texas against Cadence and other corporate
defendants, seeking compensatory and punitive damages in an
unspecified amount. The suit was filed after Cadence demanded
payment of approximately $1.0 million for design services
rendered to Uniden. Cadence since has filed a counterclaim to
recover the approximately $1.0 million owed for services
rendered. The parties agreed to dismiss voluntarily the actions
pending in the State Court of Texas and to re-file in the State
Court of California, County of Orange. Uniden refiled its
complaint on July 2, 2001 in Orange County, California.
Cadence filed its answer and counterclaim on September 12,
2001.

On December 28, 2000, a former design
services customer, Scanz Communications, filed an action for
various causes of action in the Los Angeles Superior Court of
California against Cadence and Tality, seeking compensatory and
punitive damages in an unspecified amount. The suit was filed
after Cadence demanded payment of $4,657,556.17 for design
services rendered to Scanz. Scanz filed a first amended
complaint on April 2, 2001. Following demurrers by Cadence
that were sustained in part, Scanz filed a second amended
complaint on July 10, 2001 to which Cadence and Tality
filed their answer on October 10, 2001. Scanz’s
remaining causes of action are fraud, breach of contract,
intentional interference with contract, unfair business
practices and negligent misrepresentation, for which Scanz seeks
damages in the “tens of millions of dollars”.

On June 7, 2001 Cadence filed a
cross-complaint against Scanz alleging breach of contract and
unjust enrichment, and seeking declaratory relief. On
July 12, 2001, Scanz filed an answer to Cadence’s
cross-complaint denying all allegations. Trial in this matter is
scheduled for September 23, 2002. Cadence intends to
vigorously defend the claims alleged by Scanz.

satisfy estimated requirements for shares to be issued under its
employee stock option and purchase plans.

As part of its authorized repurchase program,
Cadence has sold put warrants through private placements. At
December 29, 2001, there were 2.9 million put warrants
outstanding that entitle the holder to sell one share of common
stock to Cadence on a specified date and at specified prices
ranging from $15.50 to $25.13 per share. Additionally, during
this same period, Cadence purchased call options that entitle
Cadence to buy one share of common stock at a specified price to
satisfy anticipated stock repurchase requirements under
Cadence’s repurchase programs. At December 29, 2001,
Cadence had 2.3 million call options outstanding at
specified prices ranging from $15.75 to $25.38 per share. The
put warrants and call options outstanding at

December 29, 2001

December 29, 2001 expire on various dates
through May 2002, and Cadence has the contractual ability to
settle the options prior to their maturity. At December 29,
2001, the estimated fair value of the call options was
approximately $8.3 million and the fair value of the put
warrants was approximately $8.0 million.

If exercised, Cadence has the right to settle the
put warrants with common stock equal to the difference between
the exercise price and the fair value of the common stock at the
date of exercise. Settlement of the put warrants with common
stock could cause Cadence to issue a substantial number of
shares, depending on the exercise price of the put warrants and
the per share fair value of Cadence’s common stock at the
time of exercise. In addition, settlement of put warrants in
common stock could lead to the disposition by put warrant
holders of shares of Cadence’s common stock that such
holders may have accumulated in anticipation of the exercise of
the put warrants or call options, which may adversely affect the
price of Cadence’s common stock. At December 29, 2001,
Cadence had the ability to settle these put warrants with common
stock and, therefore, no amount was classified out of
stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Employee Stock Purchase Plans

On July 1, 2001, Cadence adopted two
employee stock purchase plans to allow Tality employees to
participate in Cadence’s employee stock purchase program.
The two plans are the 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the
ESPP, which is a qualified employee stock purchase plan under
the Internal Revenue Code, and the 2001 Non-Qualified Employee
Stock Purchase Plan, which is an employee stock purchase plan
not qualified under the Internal Revenue Code and will be
primarily used for Tality employees located outside the United
States. Other than the qualified nature of the 2001 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan, the provisions of the two plans are
generally the same. The qualified plan will be presented to
Cadence stockholders for approval at Cadence’s 2002 annual
meeting of stockholders. The plans are administered by
Cadence’s board of directors or by a committee appointed by
the board. Tality employees, including officers and employee
directors of Tality but excluding 5% or greater stockholders,
are eligible to participate if they are regular employees who
work 20 hours or more per week.

Under the Cadence ESPP, Cadence is authorized to
issue up to 25,250,000 shares of common stock to its
employees. Under the terms of the ESPP, employees can choose to
have up to 12% of their annual base earnings plus bonuses
withheld to purchase Cadence common stock. The purchase price of
the stock is 85% of the lesser of the fair market value as of
the beginning or the end of the offering periods. The offering
periods provide for concurrent 24 month offering periods
with a new 24 month offering period starting every six
months. Each offering period will be divided into four
consecutive six month purchase periods.

Under Cadence’s employee stock purchase
plans, Cadence issued 3,025,646 shares to employees in
2001, 3,168,839 shares in 2000 and 2,110,222 shares in
1999. The weighted average purchase price and the weighted
average fair value of shares issued in 2001 were $10.64 and
$25.95, respectively.

Pro Forma Information

This information is required to illustrate the
financial results of operations as if Cadence had accounted for
its grants of employee stock options under the fair value method
of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock —
Based Compensation.” The fair value of Cadence’s
options granted and shares purchased under the ESPP program for
years ended December 29, 2001, December 30, 2000 and
January 1, 2000 reported below

was estimated at the date of grant using a
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted
average assumptions assuming a dividend yield of zero for all
periods:

For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the
estimated fair value of the options is amortized over the
options’ vesting period. Cadence applies Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and related Interpretations
in accounting for its plans. Had Cadence’s stock option and
employee stock purchase plans been accounted for under SFAS
No. 123, net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share
would have been adjusted to the following pro forma amounts:

The effects of applying SFAS No. 123 on pro
forma disclosures of net income (loss) and net income (loss) per
share for 2001, 2000 and 1999 are not likely to be
representative of the pro forma effects on net income (loss) and
net income (loss) per share in future years.

Warrants

In connection with the purchase of the business
and certain assets of Comdisco Systems, Inc., or Comdisco, a
subsidiary of Comdisco, Inc., in June 1993, Cadence issued a
warrant to purchase 5,850,000 shares of Cadence’s
stock at $3.23 per share. Pursuant to the original terms of the
warrant agreement, during 1996 and 1995, Cadence repurchased
portions of the warrant applicable to 300,000 and
5,310,000 shares, respectively, for approximately
$4.3 million and $17.2 million, respectively. In 1998,



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 29, 2001

Comdisco exercised 100,000 warrants. The
warrant for the remaining 140,000 shares expires in June
2003 and can be exercised at any time in increments of not less
than 50,000 shares. The warrant was valued at the time of
issuance at approximately $1.8 million and was included as
part of the total purchase price of the assets from Comdisco.

Reserved for Future Issuance

At December 29, 2001, Cadence had reserved
the following shares of authorized but unissued common stock for
future issuance:

Stockholder Rights Plan

In February 1996, Cadence adopted a new
stockholder rights plan to protect its stockholders’ rights
in the event of a proposed or actual acquisition of 15% or more
of the outstanding shares of Cadence common stock. As amended in
February 2000, each share of Cadence common stock carries a
right to purchase one one-thousandth ( 1/1000) of a share
of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Cadence at a price of $240.00 per one
one-thousandth of a share, subject to adjustment. The rights are
subject to redemption at the option of the Board of Directors at
a price of $0.01 per right until the occurrence of certain
events. The rights expire on February 20, 2006.

Deferred Stock
Compensation

Cadence records deferred stock compensation
resulting from Tality option grants for Tality stock, sales of
Tality restricted stock, and Cadence’s acquisitions of
CadMOS and SPC. Deferred stock compensation from Tality option
grants and restricted stock sales represents the difference
between the exercise price of stock option grants to Tality
employees and directors, and restricted stock sales to certain
Cadence executives and employees, and the deemed fair market
value of Tality’s common stock at the time of those grants
and sales. Deferred stock compensation from the CadMOS and SPC
acquisitions represents the difference between the exercise
price of stock option grants to employees and the fair market
value of Cadence’s common stock at the time of acquisition.
Cadence is amortizing the deferred stock compensation to expense
over the period during which the stock options and restricted
stock vest. In the third quarter of 2001, Cadence reacquired
1,740,000 restricted Tality shares from certain Cadence
executives and employees who then repaid their related notes
payable to Cadence. Tality repurchased 220,000 restricted shares
from three of its directors.

In connection with the acquisition of CadMOS,
Cadence assumed options exercisable for 33,043 shares of Cadence
common stock granted in exchange for services at a range of
exercise prices between $0.29 and $1.34 per share. The options
vest over a five year period. Cadence has valued the estimated
fair value of the options during 2001 as they vest using the
Black-Scholes model. In 2001, the estimated fair value of the
options vested was determined to be approximately
$0.57 million and was recorded as Amortization of Deferred
Stock Compensation in the accompanying Consolidated Statements
of Operations.



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)

December 29, 2001

For the years ended December 29, 2001 and
December 30, 2000, Cadence recorded a total of
$40.4 million and $72.4 million of deferred stock
compensation, respectively. Of the $40.4 million,
$27.4 million is related to the acquisition of SPC,
$10.0 million related to the acquisition of CadMOS, and
$3.0 million related to Tality stock option grants. Of the
$72.4 million, $64.1 million is related to the stock
option grants and $8.3 million related to the restricted
stock sales in 2000. Cadence is amortizing deferred stock
compensation to expense over the period during which the stock
options and restricted stock vest. For the year ended
December 29, 2001, Cadence reversed deferred stock
compensation of $27.8 million related to the cancellation
of options.

Other
Comprehensive Income

The following table sets forth the components of
other comprehensive income, net of income tax:

INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes consisted of the
following components:

Income (loss) before income taxes included income
of approximately $139.2 million for 2001,
$43.2 million for 2000 and $11.5 million for 1999,
from Cadence’s foreign subsidiaries.

rate to income (loss) before income taxes as follows:

The components of deferred tax assets and
liabilities consisted of the following:



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)

December 29, 2001

Cadence provides for U.S. income taxes on the
earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered
permanently invested outside of the United States. At
December 29, 2001, the cumulative amount of earnings upon
which U.S. income taxes have not been provided are approximately
$501.0 million. At December 29, 2001, the unrecognized
deferred tax liability for these earnings was approximately
$84.7 million.

The net valuation allowance increased by
$25.3 million in 2001. The valuation allowance for
provision for income taxes increased by $3.2 million due to
the benefit of the amortization of stock compensation which will
only be realized if the fair market value of the Cadence common
stock on the date of exercise is greater than the exercise price
of the Cadence stock option. The valuation allowance for equity
and intangibles increased by $22.0 million in 2001. The
valuation allowance for equity and intangibles is due to the
uncertainty of domestic entities generating sufficient taxable
income, including the deduction for stock options to realize
certain domestic deferred tax assets. This portion of the
valuation allowance, identified in the above table as
“valuation allowance — equity and
intangibles”, if realizable, may reduce other intangibles
or increase equity and may not be available to offset future
provision for income taxes.

Cadence has net operating loss carryforwards
totaling $49.6 million for 2001, $28.9 million for
2000 and $28.3 million for 1999, and tax credit
carryforwards of $39.5 million for 2001 and
$28.2 million for 2000. The remaining net operating loss
carryforwards will expire at various dates from 2002 through
2021 and tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates
from 2002 through 2016.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Cadence maintains a 401(k) savings plan to
provide retirement benefits through tax deferred salary
deductions for all of its U.S. employees. Cadence may make
discretionary contributions, as determined by the Board of
Directors, which cannot exceed a specified percentage of the
annual aggregate salaries of those employees eligible to
participate. Cadence made total contributions to the plan of
$10.5 million for 2001, $9.3 million for 2000 and
$3.9 million for 1999.

Since 1996, Cadence has made venture capital
investments through Telos LP, a venture capital firm
independently managed by Telos LLC. Cadence and the Cadence 1996
Deferred Compensation Venture Investment Plan, or the 1996 Plan,
are the sole limited partners of Telos LP. The total
capital commitment by Cadence to Telos LP is $100 million,
of which Cadence had contributed $76.4 million as of
December 29, 2001. Under the 1996 Plan, Cadence directors
can defer some or all of their compensation, and certain
executives can defer payment of a portion of their compensation
to be to be invested in Telos LP.

MINORITY INTEREST

In connection with the termination of the Tality
IPO, Cadence and Tality redeemed the minority interest in
Tality. As of December 29, 2001, Cadence and Tality had

restructuring, asset impairment and unusual items in
Cadence’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Tality IPO-Related Expense and Separation
	Costs

In the year ended December 29, 2001, Cadence
recorded $4.8 million in separation costs. Of the
$4.8 million, $2.8 million related to the postponement
of the Tality IPO and $2.0 million related to Tality
separation costs, primarily information systems separation and
legal, accounting and consulting fees.

In the year ended December 30, 2000, Cadence
recorded $6.8 million in separation costs related to the
separation, and the related planned IPO of Tality,
Cadence’s then newly-formed subsidiary. These costs
primarily include legal and accounting services, strategic
business planning, information systems separation, development
of compensation and benefits strategies, and recruitment and
formation of Tality’s senior management team.

In-Process Technology

Described below are the write-offs of acquired
in-process technology charges in 2001 and 1999. There were no
write-offs of acquired in-process technology in 2000.

In the three months ended June 30, 2001,
Cadence acquired substantially all of the assets of two
companies for a preliminary aggregate price of
$10.5 million, of which $4.4 million was cash and
$6.1 million was shares of Cadence stock, plus future
contingent payments. Each acquisition was accounted for as a
purchase. Upon consummation of the acquisitions, Cadence
immediately charged to expense $1.0 million representing
acquired in-process technology that had not yet reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative future use.

Acquired in-process technology charges represent
in-process technology that had not reached technological
feasibility and had no probable alternative future use. See
“Acquisitions.”

Acquired Intangibles Write-Off

In reaction to the current decline in business
conditions in the United States generally and the wireless
communications industry in particular, Cadence restructured
certain of its businesses and realigned resources to focus on
profit contribution, high-growth markets and core opportunities.
As a result, Cadence recorded a charge of $25.8 million in
2001 related to the impairment of goodwill and acquired
intangibles associated with the acquisition of Diablo (a part of
Tality). Key factors in this write-off were significant
downsizing or reassignment of personnel directly related to
these assets and abandonment of most of Diablo’s line of
business. The charge was determined as the amount by which the
carrying value of the intangible assets associated with
Diablo’s acquisition exceeded the fair value of those
assets.



CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)

December 29, 2001

In 1999, Cadence incurred a total of
$19.9 million in asset impairment charges. Of this amount,
$13.3 million represented asset impairment of acquired
intangibles from the Excellent Design, or EXD, acquisition. This
asset impairment charge resulted from reduced Japanese sales and
the loss of key EXD employees, which together resulted in
diminished cash flow projections. Cadence entered into certain
support agreements with third parties to provide support for EXD
software tools previously sold by Cadence customers. The fair
value of the EXD acquired intangibles was based on an evaluation
of the present value of the estimated expected future cash
flows, discounted at 16%. The remaining $6.6 million in
asset impairment charges were incurred in connection with the
cancellation of an information technology services contract with
a third-party, the abandonment of capitalized software
development costs associated with certain Cadence products that
were discontinued, and the abandonment of certain third-party
software licenses related to Research and Development.

Restructuring Charges and Asset
	Impairments

In 2001, Cadence announced a worldwide
restructuring and asset impairment plan targeted at reducing
workforce and consolidating facilities and assets. The
restructuring plan was initiated primarily due to the severe
downturn in the economic environment in the United States,
particularly in the electronics industry. Cadence’s
restructuring was primarily aimed at reducing excess personnel
and capacity costs within its Tality subsidiary, dedicating
Cadence’s resources to growth areas, and focusing on profit
contribution. Cadence recorded $61.6 million of
restructuring charges associated with the worldwide
restructuring plan. Cadence’s restructuring plan and
associated costs consisted of $20.8 million for reduction
in personnel, $22.7 million to downsize and close excess
facilities and $16.6 million of asset impairment charges
related to certain long-lived assets. Management estimates that
the restructuring will result in annualized cost reductions of
approximately $70.4 million in employee salary and benefit
costs and $47.6 million in facility costs.

The restructuring plan resulted in a reduction of
705 employees, which were predominately Tality employees.
While employee reductions are across all business functions,
operating units and geographic regions, Cadence’s wireless
communications-related areas within Tality were affected more
than other areas. In addition, the number of temporary and
contract workers employed by Cadence has been reduced. Severance
costs resulting from the restructuring included severance
benefits, notice pay and out-placement services. As the result
of the separation of Tality from Cadence, approximately
$5.3 million of the restructuring charges was paid to
certain Tality employees who were participants in Cadence’s
employee stock purchase plan prior to Tality’s separation
from Cadence in October 2000. All terminations and termination
benefits were communicated to the affected employees prior to
December 29, 2001. All severance benefits will be paid out
before the end of the first quarter of 2002.

Facilities consolidation charges of
$22.7 million were incurred in connection with the
downsizing and closing of 16 sites. Closure and downsizing costs
included payments required under lease contracts, less any
applicable estimated sublease income after the properties were
abandoned, lease buyout costs, restoration costs associated with
certain lease arrangements and costs to maintain facilities
during the period after abandonment. To determine the lease
loss, which is the loss after Cadence’s cost recovery
efforts from subleasing a building, certain assumptions were
made related to the: (1) time period over which the
relevant building would remain vacant, (2) sublease terms,
and (3) sublease rates, including common area charges. The
lease loss is an estimate under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 5

Accounting for Contingencies

and represents the low end of the range, as required by this
statement, $13.1 million, which will be adjusted in the
future upon triggering events (e.g., change in estimate of time
to sublease, actual sublease rates, etc.). Cadence has estimated
that the high end of the lease loss could be $52.8 million
if facilities operating lease rental rates continue to decrease
in the applicable markets or if it takes longer than expected to
find a suitable tenant to sublease the facility. As of
December 29, 2001, six sites had been vacated and eight
sites had been downsized.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 29, 2001

Asset-related charges of $16.6 million
consisted primarily of $13.9 million of leasehold
improvements for facilities and other fixed assets that were
either abandoned or for which the resulting estimated future
reduced cash flows were insufficient to cover the associated
expenses. Cadence also recorded $2.2 million of
asset-related charges for abandoned software and
$1.5 million related to consulting services performed to
restructure its research and development process.

In 1999, Cadence recorded $13.3 million of
restructuring charges that consisted of $11.3 million to
terminate approximately 100 employees and $2.0 million to
downsize and close excess facilities. Cadence’s
restructuring plans were primarily aimed at reducing costs after
Cadence merged with Quickturn, further restructuring of
Cadence’s services business in Japan, and severance
resulting from the resignation of Cadence’s former Chief
Executive Officer. Severance costs include severance benefits,
notice pay and outplacement services. All terminations and
termination benefits were communicated to the affected employees
prior to year-end and substantially all remaining severance
benefits were paid in 2000.

Facilities consolidation charges of
$2.0 million were incurred in connection with the closure
of 15 Quickturn facilities, including $1.0 million to close
duplicate and excess facilities and $1.0 million of
abandonment costs for the related leasehold improvements.
Closure and exit costs include payments required under lease
contracts, less any applicable sublease income after the
properties were abandoned, lease buyout costs, restoration costs
associated with certain lease arrangements, and costs to
maintain facilities during the period after abandonment.
Asset-related write-offs consist of leasehold improvements of
facilities that were abandoned and whose estimated fair market
value is zero. As of December 29, 2001, 14 of the
15 Quickturn sites had been vacated. Noncancelable lease
payments on vacated facilities will be paid through 2003.

Liabilities for excess facilities and other
restructuring charges are included in accrued and other
long-term liabilities, while severance and benefits liabilities
are included in payroll and payroll-related accruals. The
following table summarizes Cadence’s restructuring activity
during fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999:

In 2001, approximately $3.7 million of the
restructuring reserve balance at December 30, 2000 was
offset to the 2001 restructuring plan.

SEGMENT REPORTING

Cadence’s chief operating decision-making
group is its Executive Staff, which includes Cadence’s
President and Chief Executive Officer and Cadence’s other
senior management. Cadence’s Executive Staff reviews the
Cadence consolidated results within three segments: Product,
Services and Maintenance, and also reviews Tality’s results
separately as a stand-alone entity.

The Product segment includes revenue and
associated costs to design and license to customers a variety of
electronic design automation products. The Services segment
includes revenue and associated costs to offer methodology and
design services either to assist companies in developing
electronic designs or to assume responsibility for the design
effort when customers wish to outsource this work. The
Maintenance segment includes revenue and associated costs
primarily for a technical support organization, and maintenance
agreements are offered to customers either as part of
Cadence’s product license agreements or separately. Within
the Cadence consolidated results, Tality revenue is included in
the Services segment, associated Tality cost of goods sold is
reflected in each of the three segments, consistent with the
benefit derived by the respective segments from those services,
and Tality operating expenses are included in the other items.

Segment income from operations is defined as
gross margin under generally accepted accounting principles and
excludes amortization of acquired intangibles, inventory
write-down and other, operating expenses (marketing and sales,
research and development and general and administrative),
unusual items, other income, net, and income taxes.
Profitability information about Cadence’s segments is
available only to the extent of gross margin by segment, and
operating expenses and other income and expense items are
managed on a functional basis. There are no differences between
the accounting policies used to measure profit and loss for
segments and those used on a consolidated basis. Revenue is
defined as revenue from external customers with no inter-segment
revenue. Tality revenue includes inter-company revenue of
$9.3 million for the year ended 2001. There was no
inter-company revenue in 2000 or 1999.

Cadence’s management does not identify or
allocate its assets, including capital expenditures, by
operating segment. Accordingly, assets are not being reported by
segment because the information is not available by segment and
is not reviewed by Cadence’s Executive Staff to make
decisions about resources to be allocated among the segments or
to assess their performance. Depreciation and amortization of
purchased software is allocated among the segments in order to
determine each segment’s gross margin.

SUBSEQUENT EVENT

In early 1999, Cadence entered into negotiations
with Intelect Communications, Inc. (since renamed TeraForce
Technology Corporation), and Intelect’s wholly-owned
subsidiary, DNA Enterprises, Inc., with respect to a potential
purchase of substantially all the assets of DNA. The transaction
was not consummated and, in July 1999, Intelect and DNA filed
suit against Cadence in a Texas state court alleging breach of
contract, fraud, negligent misrepresentation and breach of
fiduciary duty, seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive
damages. Cadence has answered, denying liability. In January
2002 the court denied Cadence’s motion for Partial Summary
Judgment and set a trial date for March 2002.

In February 2002, Cadence announced a further
restructuring of its Tality business to increase its focus on
communications IC design and intellectual property used in
wireline communications equipment and to no longer provides
board-level, mechanical and packaging services for data and
telecommunications equipment. As a result, Tality will reduce
its headcount by approximately 200 people. The reductions
will result in the closure of its Ottawa, Canada; Lowell,
Massachusetts; and Noida, India design centers. A restructuring
charge of approximately $25.0 million will be taken in the
first quarter of 2002 for severance, facility closure and
related asset impairments.
