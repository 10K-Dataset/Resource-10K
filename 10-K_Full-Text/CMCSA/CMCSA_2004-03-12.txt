PART I

ITEM 1

BUSINESS

We
are a Pennsylvania corporation and were incorporated in December 2001. We have been
involved, through our predecessors, in the development, management and operation of
broadband cable networks since 1963.

We
are involved in:

•

Cable-through
the development, management and operation of broadband communications networks,
including video, high-speed Internet and phone service, and

•

Content-through
our consolidated programming investments, including our national cable television
networks E! Entertainment Television, Style Network, The Golf Channel,
Outdoor Life Network and G4, and our regional programming-related
enterprises Comcast Spectacor, Comcast SportsNet, Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic,
Comcast SportsNet Chicago, Cable Sports Southeast and CN8, as well as other
programming investments.

We have
our principal executive offices at 1500 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA 19102-2148. Our
telephone number is (215) 665-1700. We also have a world wide web site at
http://www.comcast.com. Copies of the annual, quarterly and current reports we file with
the SEC, and any amendments to those reports, are available on our web site. The
information posted on our web site is not incorporated into this Annual Report.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Refer
to Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for information
about our operations by business segment.

GENERAL DEVELOPMENTS OF OUR BUSINESS

Broadband Acquisition and Integration

On
November 18, 2002, we acquired AT&T Corp.‘s broadband business, which we refer to
as “Broadband.” The Broadband cable systems included 12.8 million subscribers
and other cable-related investments.

During
2003, we continued integrating Broadband’s operations into ours. The key integration
priorities achieved include improved operating results, accelerated system rebuilds, and
the reversal of Broadband’s basic subscriber losses.

TWE Restructuring

On
March 31, 2003, we announced the successful completion of the restructuring of Time Warner
Entertainment Company L.P., which we acquired as part of the Broadband acquisition. As a
result of the restructuring, we received common-equivalent preferred stock of Time Warner
Inc. and a 21% economic stake in the business of Time Warner Cable Inc., a Time Warner
subsidiary that now holds all of its cable interests. In addition, we received $2.1
billion in cash. The trust that holds the shares has exercised a right to have Time Warner
Cable register the sale of up to 17.9% of Time Warner Cable, although we cannot predict
when the trustee will be able to sell the shares. Refer to

Note 5

to our consolidated
financial statements included in Item 8 for more information about the Time Warner
Entertainment restructuring and the trust.

Sale of QVC

On
September 17, 2003, we completed the sale to Liberty Media Corporation of our approximate
57% interest in QVC, Inc. for an aggregate value of approximately $7.7 billion. QVC
markets a wide variety of products directly to consumers primarily on merchandise-focused
television programs. Financial information related to QVC is presented as discontinued
operations in our financial statements. Refer to

Note 5

to our consolidated financial
statements included in Item 8 for more information about the sale of QVC.

Debt Reduction

During
2003, we reduced our total debt outstanding by approximately $7.9 billion primarily with
proceeds received from the sale of QVC and related Liberty Notes, the TWE restructuring
and other transactions.

Proposed Merger with The Walt Disney Company

On
February 11, 2004, we announced that we had made a proposal to The Walt Disney Company to
merge the two companies in a tax-free transaction. The terms of the proposal include our
issuing 0.78 shares of our Class A common stock for each Disney share, which represented,
based upon the closing price of our Class A common stock on February 10, 2004, an
aggregate equity value of approximately $54 billion, and our assumption of

$11.9 billion of Disney net debt, for a
total transaction value of approximately $66 billion. On February 16, 2004, the Disney
Board of Directors rejected this proposal, although the proposal remains outstanding.

DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESSES

Cable

We
currently are the largest cable operator in the United States. As of December 31, 2003,
our consolidated cable operations served 21.5 million subscribers in 35 states, passed
39.8 million homes, and provided digital cable to 7.7 million subscribers, high-speed
Internet to 5.3 million subscribers and phone to 1.3 million subscribers.

(1)

On
November 18, 2002, we consummated the Broadband acquisition.  The Broadband acquisition
 substantially  increased       the size of our cable operations and direct  comparisons
of our cable  information for periods prior to November 18,       2002 to  subsequent
 periods are not  meaningful.  The  information  as of December 31, 2002  excludes the
operating       statistics for Broadband cable systems held for sale.

(2)

In
April 1999, we acquired a controlling interest in Jones Intercable, Inc. In January
2000, we acquired Lenfest Communications, Inc. and began consolidating the
results of Comcast Cablevision of Garden State, L.P. In August 2000, we acquired
Prime Communications LLC. On December 31, 2000 and January 1, 2001, we completed
our cable systems exchanges with AT&T and Adelphia Communications,
respectively. In April and June 2001, we acquired cable systems serving an
aggregate of approximately 697,000 subscribers from AT&T. The subscriber
information as of December 31, 2000 excludes the effects of our exchange with AT&T.

(3)

A
home is "passed" if we can connect it to our  distribution  system  without  further
 extending  the  transmission       lines. As described in Note 4 below,  in the case of
certain  multiple  dwelling units, or MDUs,  homes "passed" are       counted on an
adjusted basis. "Homes passed" is an estimate based on the best available information.

(4)

Generally,
 a dwelling or  commercial  unit with one or more  television  sets  connected to a
system  counts as one       cable subscriber. In the case of certain MDUs, we count cable
subscribers on an FCC equivalent basis.

(5)

A
subscriber is "digital ready" if the subscriber is in a market where we have launched our
digital cable service.

(6)

A
dwelling  with one or more digital  converter  boxes counts as one digital  cable
 subscriber.  On average,  as of       December 31, 2003, each digital cable subscriber
had 1.5 digital set-top boxes.

(7)

A
home  passed is  "available"  if we can  connect it to our  distribution  system  without
 further  upgrading  the       transmission lines and if we offer the service in that
area.

(8)

Prior
to the Broadband acquisition, the number of phone "available" homes and subscribers was
not material.

Cable Services

We
offer a variety of services over our cable networks, including video, high-speed Internet
and phone. The greater the bandwidth, the greater the information-carrying capacity of the
system. Over the past several years, we have deployed fiber optic cable and digital
compression technology, and upgraded the technical quality of our cable networks. As a
result, we have increased the reliability and capacity of our systems, enabling us to
deliver additional services, such as digital cable, high-speed Internet and phone. As of
December 31, 2003, approximately 95% of our cable systems are capable of handling two-way
communications. We expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures during 2004
to complete the upgrade of the cable systems acquired in the Broadband acquisition.

Video Services

We
receive the majority of our revenues from subscription services. Subscribers typically pay
us on a monthly basis and generally may discontinue services at any time. Monthly
subscription rates and related charges vary according to the type of service selected and
the type of equipment subscribers use.

We
offer a full range of video services. We tailor both our basic channel line-up and our
additional channel offerings to each system according to demographics, programming
preferences and local regulation. Our video service offerings include the following:

Basic
programming.

Our basic cable service typically consists of between 10-20 channels of
programming. This service generally consists of programming provided by national
television networks, local broadcast television stations, locally-originated programming,
including governmental and public access, and limited satellite-delivered programming.

Expanded
basic programming.

Our expanded basic cable service includes a group of
satellite-delivered or non-broadcast channels in addition to the basic channel line-up.

Premium
services.

Our premium services generally offer, without commercial interruption,
feature motion pictures, live and taped sporting events, concerts and other special
features.

Pay-per-view
programming.

Our pay-per-view service permits our subscribers to order, for a separate
fee, individual feature motion pictures and special event programs, such as professional
boxing, professional wrestling and concerts on an unedited, commercial-free basis.

Digital
cable

. Subscribers to our digital cable service receive one or more of the following:

•

an
interactive program guide,

•

multiple
channels of digital programming and music,

•

"multiplexes"
of premium channels that are varied as to time of broadcast or programming content theme,

•

additional
 pay-per-view  programming,  such as more  pay-per-view  options and/or frequent
 showings of the most          popular films,

•

video-on-demand
service, commonly known as VOD,

•

high-definition
television, and

•

digital
video recorders.

High-Speed Internet
Services

Residential
subscribers can connect their personal computers via cable modems to access online
information, including the Internet, at faster speeds than that of conventional modems.
Prior to March 2002, in areas our cable systems served, we marketed high-speed Internet
services operated by a third-party Internet service provider. By March 2002, we had moved
all of our high-speed Internet subscribers to our own service. In addition to offering our
own high-speed Internet service, we have agreements with a number of third-party Internet
service providers, or ISPs, under which we make access to our facilities available and the
ISP markets a high-speed Internet service that is provided over our cable systems.

Phone Services

In
certain areas, we provide to our subscribers traditional circuit-switched local telephone
services, a full array of associated features and third-party long distance services, all
under the brand “Comcast Digital Phone.” We are also beginning to launch Voice
over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”), a phone service delivered over our cable
infrastructure involving voice transmissions using Internet protocol, on a limited
commercial basis.

Advertising Sales

We
generate revenues from the sale of advertising time to local, regional and national
advertisers on non-broadcast networks we carry over our cable systems. As part of our
programming carriage agreements with these networks, we receive an allocation of scheduled
advertising time into which we insert commercials. In any particular cable system market
area, we generally insert commercials into an average of 32 networks.

- 3 -

We
also coordinate the advertising sales efforts of other cable operators in certain markets.
Utilizing these arrangements, we have formed and operate advertising interconnects, which
establish a physical, direct link between multiple unaffiliated cable systems and provide
for the insertion primarily of regional and national advertising across larger geographic
areas.

Other Revenue Sources

We
also generate revenues from installation services, commissions from third-party electronic
retailing and from other services, such as providing businesses with Internet connectivity
and networked business applications.

Sales and Marketing

Our
sales efforts are primarily directed toward generating incremental revenues in our
franchise areas and increasing the number of subscribers we serve. We sell our products
and services through:

•

telemarketing,

•

direct
mail advertising,

•

door-to-door
selling,

•

cable
television advertising,

•

local
media advertising, and

•

retail
outlets.

Programming

We
generally acquire a license for the programming we sell to our subscribers by paying a
monthly fee to the licensor on a per subscriber, per channel basis. Our programming costs
are increased by:

•

growth
in the number of subscribers,

•

expansion
of the number of channels provided to subscribers, and

•

increases
in contract rates from programming suppliers.

We
attempt to secure long-term programming contracts with volume discounts and/or marketing
support and incentives from programming suppliers. Our programming contracts are generally
for a fixed period of time and are subject to negotiated renewal. We expect our
programming costs to remain our largest single expense item for the foreseeable future. In
recent years, the cable and satellite video industries have experienced a substantial
increase in the cost of programming, particularly sports programming. We anticipate our
programming costs will increase in the future primarily as a result of increased cost to
produce and purchase programming and additional programming channels provided to our
subscribers. These increases are mitigated, to some extent, by additional volume discounts
associated with our increased size and future growth in subscribers receiving such
programming channels. The inability to pass these programming cost increases on to our
subscribers would have a material adverse impact on our operating results.

We
also expect to be subject to increasing demands by broadcasters to obtain the required
consent for the retransmission of broadcast programming to our subscribers. We cannot
predict the impact of these negotiations or the effect on our subscribers should we be
required to stop offering this programming.

Customer and
Technical Service

We
service our customers through local, regional and national call and technical centers.
Generally, our call centers provide 24-hour per day, 7-day per week call answering
capability, telemarketing and other services. Our technical services function performs
various tasks, including cable installations, transmission and distribution plant
maintenance, plant upgrades and other customer service related activities. In 2003, we
opened new call centers and expanded certain of our existing call centers to provide
customer service and support to the cable systems acquired in the Broadband acquisition.

Competition

Video Services

Our
cable systems compete with a number of different sources that provide news, information
and entertainment programming to consumers, including:

•

program
distributors that use direct broadcast satellite, or DBS, systems that transmit satellite
signals containing video programming, data and other information to receiving dishes of
varying sizes located on the subscriber's premises,

•

local
television broadcast stations that provide off-air programming which can be received
using an antenna and a television set, as well as broadcast digital subscription services
that can be received by a special set-top box,

•

satellite
master antenna television systems, commonly known as SMATVs, that generally serve
condominiums, apartment and office complexes, and residential developments,

•

other
operators who build and operate wireline communications systems in the same communities
that we serve, including those operating as franchised cable operations or under

- 4 -

an
alternative regulatory scheme known as Open Video Systems, or OVS,

•

interactive
online computer services, including Internet distribution of movies,

•

newspapers,
magazines and book stores,

•

movie
theaters,

•

live
concerts and sporting events, and

•

video
stores and home video products.

In
recent years, Congress has enacted legislation and the FCC has adopted regulatory policies
intended to provide a favorable operating environment for existing competitors and for
potential new competitors to our cable systems. The FCC has recently created a new
wireless service, known as Multichannel Video Distribution and Data Service, or MVDDS,
that we also expect to compete with our cable systems. In order to compete effectively, we
strive to provide, at a reasonable price to subscribers, new products and services,
superior technical performance and customer service, and a greater variety of video
programming.

DBS
Systems.

According to recent government and industry reports, conventional, medium and
high-power satellites currently provide video programming to over 20 million customers in
the United States. DBS providers with high-power satellites typically offer to their
subscribers more than 300 channels of programming, including programming services
substantially similar to those our cable systems provide. Two companies, DIRECTV and
EchoStar, provide service to substantially all of these DBS subscribers.

DBS
service can be received throughout the continental United States through a small roof top
or side-mounted outside antenna. DBS systems use video compression technology to increase
channel capacity and digital technology to improve the quality and quantity of the signals
transmitted to their subscribers. Our digital cable service is competitive with the
programming, channel capacity and the digital quality of signals delivered to subscribers
by DBS systems.

Federal
legislation establishes, among other things, a permanent compulsory copyright license that
permits DBS systems to retransmit local broadcast television signals to subscribers who
reside in the local television station’s market. These companies are currently
transmitting local broadcast signals in most markets that we currently serve.
Additionally, federal law generally provides DBS systems with access to all
cable-affiliated video programming services delivered by satellite. As a result, satellite
carriers are competitive to cable system operators like us because they offer programming
that closely resembles what we offer. These satellite carriers are attempting to expand
their service offerings to include, among other things, high-speed Internet service, and
are entering marketing arrangements in which their service is promoted and sold by local
exchange carriers.

SMATV.

Our
cable systems also compete for subscribers with SMATV systems. SMATV system
operators typically are not subject to regulation like local franchised cable
system operators. SMATV systems offer subscribers both improved reception of
local television stations and many of the same satellite-delivered programming
services offered by franchised cable systems. In addition, some SMATV operators
are offering packages of telephony, data and video services to private
residential and commercial developments. SMATV system operators often enter
into exclusive service agreements with building owners or homeowners’ associations,
although some states have enacted laws to provide cable systems access to these
complexes.

Overbuilds.

We
operate our cable systems pursuant to a non-exclusive franchise that is issued by the
community’s governing body such as a city council, a county board of supervisors or,
in some cases, by a state regulatory agency. Federal law prohibits franchising
authorities from unreasonably denying requests for additional franchises, and it permits
franchising authorities to operate cable systems. Companies that traditionally have not
provided cable services and that have substantial financial resources (such as public
utilities that own certain of the poles to which our cables are attached) may also obtain
cable franchises and may provide competing communications services. These and other
wireline communications systems offer cable and other communications services in various
areas where we hold franchises. We anticipate that facilities-based competitors will
develop in other franchise areas that we serve.

High-Speed Internet
Services

Most
of our cable systems offer high-speed Internet services within their service areas. These
systems compete with a number of other companies, many of whom have substantial resources,
including:

•

local
telephone companies, such as Verizon Communications, Inc., SBC Communications, Inc.,
BellSouth Corporation and Qwest Communications International, Inc.,

•

existing
ISPs, such as America Online, Earthlink, Inc. and Microsoft Corporation, and

•

long
distance telephone companies, such as AT&T Corp. and Sprint Corporation.

- 5 -

The
deployment of digital subscriber line, or DSL, technology allows Internet access to be
provided to subscribers over telephone lines at data transmission speeds substantially
greater than that of conventional telephone modems. Numerous companies, including
telephone companies, have introduced DSL service, and certain telephone companies are
seeking to provide high-speed Internet services without regard to present service
boundaries and other regulatory restrictions. The FCC recently adopted an order that will
reduce the obligations of local telephone companies to offer their broadband facilities on
a wholesale basis to competitors, and the FCC is considering further measures to
deregulate the retail broadband offerings of local telephone companies as well. Congress
may also consider measures to deregulate such broadband offerings.

A
number of cable operators have reached agreements to provide unaffiliated ISPs access to
their cable systems in the absence of regulatory requirements. We reached
“access” agreements with several national and regional third-party ISPs.
Additionally, in connection with the restructuring of Time Warner Entertainment, we
entered into a three-year non-exclusive access agreement with Time Warner. Under an
agreement entered into in connection with the Broadband acquisition, we also agreed to
offer to Microsoft an access agreement on terms no less favorable than those provided to
these and other ISPs with respect to specified cable systems. We cannot provide any
assurance, however, that regulatory authorities will not impose “open access” or
similar requirements on us as part of an industry-wide requirement. These requirements
could adversely affect our results of operations.

During
2003, a number of competitors offered substantial price discounts to subscribers willing
to sign annual contracts or purchase additional bundled services. We expect competition
for high-speed Internet service subscribers to remain intense, with companies competing on
service availability, price, transmission speed and bundled services.

Phone Services

Our
traditional circuit-switched local service competes against incumbent local exchange
carriers, cellular telephone service providers, competitive local exchange carriers
(including established long distance companies) and VoIP service providers. Many
telecommunications carriers are expanding their offerings to include high-speed Internet
service, such as DSL. The incumbent local exchange carriers have substantial capital and
other resources, longstanding customer relationships, extensive existing facilities and
network rights-of-way. A few competitive local exchange carriers also have existing local
networks and significant financial resources.

We
expect advances in communications technology, as well as changes in the marketplace and
the regulatory and legislative environments, to occur in the future. We refer you to

page

for a detailed discussion of legislative and regulatory factors that may affect the
telecommunications market. Other new technologies and services may develop and may compete
with services that our cable systems offer. Consequently, we are unable to predict the
effect that ongoing or future developments might have on our business and operations.

LEGISLATION AND REGULATION

Our
cable and phone businesses are subject to numerous regulatory requirements, prohibitions
and limitations imposed by various federal and state laws, local ordinances and our
franchise agreements. Our content businesses are generally not subject to direct
governmental regulation. Our high-speed Internet business, while not currently regulated,
may be subject to regulation in the future. Laws and regulations affect the prices we can
charge for some services, such as basic cable service and associated customer-premises
equipment, the costs we incur (for example, for attaching our wires to poles owned by
utility companies), the relationships we establish with our suppliers, subscribers and
competitors, and many other aspects of our business.

- 7 -

The
most significant federal law affecting our cable business is the Communications Act of
1934, as amended. The provisions of the Communications Act and the manner in which the
FCC, state and local authorities, and the courts implement and interpret those provisions
affect our ability to develop and execute business plans, our ability to raise capital and
the competitive dynamics between and among different sectors of the communications and
entertainment industries in which we operate. The FCC also has the authority to enforce
its regulations through the imposition of substantial fines, the issuance of
cease-and-desist orders and the imposition of other administrative sanctions, such as the
revocation of FCC licenses needed to operate some of the transmission facilities we use in
connection with our cable business.

We
believe we are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable statutory and
regulatory requirements imposed by, or under, the Communications Act, but caution that the
precise requirements of the law are not always clear. Moreover, many laws and regulations
can be interpreted in after-the-fact enforcement proceedings or private party litigation
in a manner that is inconsistent with the judgments we have made. We also note that
regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do
change, existing rules or interpretations of existing rules, or prescribe new ones.
Judicial decisions often alter the regulatory framework in ways that are inconsistent with
regulator, business and investor expectations. In addition, our cable business can be
significantly affected by the enactment of new legislation. Congress seriously considers
the enactment of new legislative requirements potentially affecting our businesses
virtually every year. Even though new laws infrequently result, we always face the risk
that Congress will approve legislation significantly affecting the cable industry. In
particular, we could be materially disadvantaged if we are subject to new laws or
regulations that do not equally affect our satellite, wireline and wireless competitors.

A
major objective of Congress and the FCC is to increase competition in all communications
services, including those central to our business. For example, over the last ten years,
Congress removed barriers to local telephone companies offering video services in their
local service areas, and the FCC has assigned spectrum licenses for MVDDS, a new wireless
service for providing multichannel video programming. The FCC has also paved the way for
additional satellite competition and is currently pursuing efforts intended to enable
utility power lines to be used to provide video and high-speed Internet services. Our
cable business could be affected by any new competitors that enter the video or high-speed
Internet businesses as a result of these and similar efforts by Congress or the FCC. In
particular, we could be materially disadvantaged if we remain subject to legal constraints
that do not apply equally to these new competitors.

There
are potential risks associated with various proceedings that are currently pending at the
FCC, in the courts, and before federal and state legislatures and local franchise
authorities. We believe few of these proceedings hold the potential to materially affect
our ability to conduct our cable business. Among the more substantial areas of exposure
are the following:

Broadband
Acquisition

. The FCC approved the Broadband acquisition in November 2002, subject to
various conditions. The most significant were a requirement for the divestiture of our
interest in Time Warner Cable, a requirement that the Time Warner Cable interest be placed
in trust pending divesture, and safeguards that limit our involvement in Time Warner Cable
and the programming-related activities of the two partnerships held jointly by us and Time
Warner Cable. Complying with these conditions has limited and will continue to limit our
flexibility as to the timing and nature of a sale of the Time Warner Cable interest and,
in the interim, will constrain our business dealings with Time Warner Cable and Time
Warner. We have fully complied with these conditions, and are committed to meeting our
obligations under the FCC’s merger order going-forward.

Ownership
Limits

. The FCC is considering imposing “horizontal ownership limits” that
would limit the percentage of multichannel video subscribers – those that subscribe
to cable, DBS, MMDS and other multichannel distributors – that any single provider
could serve nationwide. A federal appellate court struck down the previous 30% limit, and
the FCC is now considering this issue anew. As we already serve nearly 29% of multichannel
video subscribers, limits similar to those previously imposed would restrict our ability
to take advantage of future growth opportunities. The FCC is also assessing whether it
should reinstate “vertical ownership limits” on the number of affiliated
programming services a cable operator may carry on its cable systems (the previous limit
of 40% of the first 75 channels had also been invalidated by the federal appellate court).
While our video programming interests are modest, new vertical limits could affect our
content-related business plans. Finally, the FCC is considering revisions to its ownership
attribution rules that would affect which cable subscribers are counted under any
horizontal ownership limit and which programming interests are counted for purposes of any
vertical ownership limit.

Pricing

. The
Communications Act and the FCC’s regulations and policies limit the prices that
cable systems may charge for basic services and equipment in communities that are not
subject to effective competition, as defined by federal law. Failure to comply with these

- 8 -

rate rules could result in rate reductions and refunds for subscribers.
From time to time, Congress considers imposing new pricing or packaging regulations on
the cable industry. Also, the General Accounting Office occasionally issues reports
regarding cable pricing or packaging issues. We cannot now predict whether or when
Congress or any regulatory agency may adopt any new constraints on the pricing or
packaging of cable services. Also, various competitors are trying to persuade the FCC and
the Justice Department to limit our ability to respond to increased competition by
offering promotions or other discounts in an effort to retain existing subscribers or
regain those we have lost. We believe our competitive pricing practices are lawful and
pro-competitive. If we cannot make individualized offers to subscribers who would
otherwise choose a different provider, our subscriber attrition may increase, or our
overall prices may need to be reduced, or both.

High-Speed
Internet Service

. Ever since high-speed Internet service was introduced, some local
governments and various competitors have sought to impose regulatory requirements on how
we deal with third-party ISPs. Thus far, only a few local governments have imposed such
requirements, and the courts have invalidated all of them. Likewise, the FCC has refused
to treat our service as a common carrier “telecommunications service,” but has
instead classified it as an “interstate information service,” which has
historically meant that no regulations apply. However, the FCC’s decision recently
was vacated by a panel of a federal appellate court. The FCC has asked for a rehearing of
the case by a larger panel of the appellate court, but there is likely to be continuing
uncertainty about how our high-speed Internet service will ultimately be classified for
regulatory purposes. In addition, even if the FCC’s decision is upheld, the FCC will
then renew its assessment of whether to impose any regulatory requirements on high-speed
Internet service and also whether local franchising authorities should be permitted to
impose fees or other requirements, such as service quality or customer service standards.
A few franchising authorities have sued us seeking payment of franchise fees on high-speed
Internet service revenues. Further, a number of software and content providers and
electronic retailers are now urging the FCC to adopt certain “nondiscrimination
principles” that purport to be intended to allow Internet customers access to the
Internet content of their choosing (something we already provide). We cannot now predict
whether these or similar regulations will be adopted and, if so, what effects, if any,
they would have on our business.

Internet
Regulation

. Congress and federal regulators have adopted a wide range of measures
affecting Internet use, including, for example, consumer privacy, copyright protection,
defamation liability, taxation and obscenity, and state and local governmental
organizations have adopted Internet-related regulations, as well. These various
governmental jurisdictions are also considering additional regulations in these and other
areas, such as pricing, service and product quality, and intellectual property ownership.
The adoption of new laws or the adaptation of existing laws to the Internet could have a
material adverse effect on our high-speed Internet business. Recently, Congress enacted
anti-SPAM legislation creating certain rights and obligations applicable to us as an ISP,
and also imposing limitations on our ability to use electronic mail for the purpose of
sending commercial messages to existing and potential customers. The exact parameters of
the law remain to be developed by regulations that are to be promulgated by the Federal
Trade Commission, or FTC, and the FCC. In addition, Congress has not extended the
moratorium on state and local taxation of Internet access (including access via high-speed
Internet service). The five-year moratorium expired on November 1, 2003. Congress is still
considering bills that would extend the moratorium, but it is uncertain if and when such
an extension might be adopted. In the absence of the moratorium, state and local
governments might seek to impose new taxes on Internet access, which could adversely
affect the operating results of our high-speed Internet service.

Must-Carry/Retransmission
Consent

. Cable companies are currently subject to a requirement that they carry,
without compensation, the programming transmitted by most commercial and non-commercial
local television stations (“must-carry”). Alternatively, local television
stations may insist that a cable operator negotiate for “retransmission
consent,” which may enable popular stations to demand significant concessions (such
as the carriage of and payment for other programming networks) as a condition of our
ability to transmit the TV broadcast signals that cable subscribers expect to receive. As
broadcasters transition from analog to digital transmission technologies, the FCC is
considering whether to require cable companies to simultaneously carry both analog and
digital signals of a single broadcaster. It is also considering whether to allow
broadcasters to choose must-carry for either their analog or digital signals during this
transition period. Additionally, it is considering whether, following the digital
transition and the return of broadcaster analog spectrum to the government, a cable
company may be required to carry multiple digital programming streams that each
broadcaster may include within its digital transmission. If the FCC should adopt such
must-carry requirements, we would have less freedom to allocate the usable spectrum of our
cable plant to provide the services that we believe will be of greatest interest to our
subscribers. This could diminish our ability to attract and retain subscribers. In
addition, must-carry requirements may similarly reduce the freedom of other cable
operators to allocate use of their cable plant. This could adversely impact the ability of
our cable networks

- 9 -

to maintain or increase their carriage. We cannot now predict whether the
FCC will impose these or similar carriage obligations on us.

Program
Access

. The Communications Act and the FCC’s “program access” rules
prevent satellite video programmers affiliated with cable operators from favoring cable
operators over competing multichannel video distributors, such as DBS, and limit the
ability of such programmers to offer exclusive programming arrangements to cable
operators. The FCC has extended the exclusivity restrictions through October 2007. The FCC
has concluded that the program access rules do not apply to programming services, such as
Comcast SportsNet, that are delivered terrestrially. However, the FCC has indicated that
it may reconsider how it regulates cable operators with regional sports programming
interests in its cable ownership rulemaking. Any decision by the FCC or Congress to single
out for new regulation cable operators like us who have regional sports programming
interests could have an adverse impact on our cable and programming businesses. Some
initiatives are underway to enact program access-type regulations at the state or local
level. We believe any such regulations would be preempted by federal law or otherwise be
unlawful, but we cannot predict at this time whether such regulations will be enacted or
found to be enforceable.

Consumer
Electronics Equipment Compatibility

. The FCC has adopted rules to implement an
agreement between the cable and consumer electronics industries aimed at promoting the
manufacture of “plug-and-play” TV sets that can connect directly to the cable
network and receive one-way, analog and digital cable services without the need for a
set-top box. Among other things, the rules: direct cable operators to implement technical
standards in their networks to support these digital television sets; require operators to
provide a sufficient supply of conditional access devices to subscribers who want to
receive scrambled programming services on their digital television sets; and require
operators to support basic home recording rights and copy protection rules for digital
programming content. These rules are being challenged at the FCC and in the courts, and we
cannot at this time predict the outcome of these challenges. In addition, the FCC has
initiated rulemaking that will consider additional plug-and-play regulations, including
standards for approving new digital connectors and copy protection technologies that cable
operators would have to support. It is uncertain when the FCC will complete this
rulemaking and how it might affect cable operators. Also, the cable and consumer
electronics industries are currently negotiating an agreement that would allow for the
manufacture of two-way, interactive plug-and-play television sets. Once this agreement is
finalized, it will likely be subject to a separate FCC rulemaking. It is unclear how this
process will unfold and how it will ultimately affect our cable business and our efforts
to sell cable services at retail outlets.

Phone
Service

. Our traditional circuit-switched phone business is subject to federal, state
and local regulation. In general, the Communications Act imposes interconnection
requirements and universal service obligations on all telecommunications service
providers, including those that provide traditional circuit-switched phone service over
cable facilities, and more significant regulations on incumbent local exchange carriers,
such as Verizon and SBC. These traditional common carrier rules, however, are being
re-evaluated at the FCC and in Congress. For example, the FCC has initiated several
rulemakings that, in the aggregate, could significantly change the rules that apply to
telephone competition, including the relationship between wireless and wireline providers,
long distance and local providers, and incumbents and new entrants, and it is unclear how
those proceedings (and the litigation and implementation proceedings that are already
underway as a product of one such rulemaking) will affect our phone business. We are
beginning to launch VoIP on a limited commercial basis. The FCC has initiated rulemaking
to consider whether and how to regulate VoIP services. VoIP services may also be subject
to potential regulation at the state level, and several states have attempted to impose
traditional common-carrier regulation on such services. It is unclear how these
VoIP-related proceedings at the federal and state levels, and the related judicial
proceedings that will ensue, might affect our planned VoIP service.

Franchise
Matters

. Cable operators generally operate their cable systems pursuant to
non-exclusive franchises granted by local or state franchising authorities. While the
terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction,
these franchises typically last for a fixed term, obligate the franchisee to pay franchise
fees and meet service quality, customer service and other requirements, and are terminable
if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions. The Communications Act
includes provisions governing the franchising process, including, among other things,
renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of
renewal. We anticipate that our future franchise renewal prospects generally will be
favorable.

Leased
Access/PEG.

The Communications Act permits franchising authorities to require cable
operators to set aside channels for public, educational and governmental access
programming. The Communications Act also requires a cable system with 36 or more activated
channels to designate a significant portion of its channel capacity for commercial leased
access by third parties to provide programming that may compete with services offered
directly by the cable operator.

- 10 -

State
and Local Taxes

. Some states and their subdivisions are considering imposing new
taxes, including sales taxes, on the services we offer. We cannot predict at this time
whether such taxes will be enacted or what impact they might have on our business.

Other
Regulatory Issues

. There are a number of other regulatory matters under review by
Congress, the FCC, and other federal agencies that could affect our cable business. We
briefly highlight these issues below:

•

Cable/Broadcast
Cross-Ownership:

In 1996, the FCC eliminated regulations precluding the cross-ownership
of a national broadcasting network and a cable system and in 2003 it repealed its
regulations prohibiting the common ownership of other broadcasting interests and cable
systems in the same geographical areas.

•

Tier
Buy Through:

The Communications Act requires cable operators to allow subscribers to
purchase premium or pay-per-view services without the necessity of subscribing to any
tier of service, other than the basic service tier. The applicability of this rule in
certain situations remains unclear, and adverse decisions by the FCC on this issue could
affect our pricing and packaging of such services.

•

Content
Regulation:

The Communications Act prohibits the transmission of obscene programming over
cable systems. Members of Congress, the FCC and some consumers from time to time express
concerns about the distribution of certain other programming over cable systems that
could lead to efforts to regulate the content of the programming we carry.

•

Set-Top
Box Regulation:

Current FCC rules bar cable operators from leasing subscribers digital
set-top boxes that integrate security and other operating functions, effective July 1,
2006. The FCC is conducting a rulemaking on the ban, and we have urged elimination of the
ban on the grounds that it will limit consumer choice, increase the cost of set-top box
equipment, and slow the deployment of digital cable services, but there is no assurance
that the FCC will accept our position.

•

Broadcast
Flag:

The FCC has adopted rules that require cable operators to implement the "broadcast
flag," a code that may be embedded in digital broadcast programming that directs digital
TVs and certain other consumer electronics equipment to block the redistribution of such
content over the Internet. It is unclear how these rules might affect the future design
of cable-related equipment and home-networking technologies. Several petitions have been
filed at the FCC requesting revisions to the broadcast flag rules. We cannot now predict
how or when the FCC will rule on these petitions. The FCC has also initiated rulemaking
to consider, among other things, whether cable operators should be permitted to encrypt
digital basic services. It is uncertain when this rulemaking will be completed and how it
will affect cable operators.

•

MDU
Access:

The FCC has adopted rules to promote competitive entry into the MDU market. These
rules are intended to make it easier for new multichannel video service providers to
compete with established cable operators.

•

Pole
Attachments:

The Communications Act requires that utilities provide cable systems with
nondiscriminatory access to any pole, or right-of-way controlled by the utility, and the
FCC has adopted rules, upheld by the courts, that regulate the rates utilities may charge
for such access. There is always the possibility that the FCC could alter the pole
attachment rate paid by cable operators, and such adverse decisions could potentially
increase our pole attachment costs. Additionally, significantly increased pole attachment
rates apply to those pole attachments that are subject to the FCC's telecommunications
services pole rates.

•

Privacy
Regulation:

The Communications Act generally restricts the nonconsensual collection and
disclosure of subscribers' personal information by cable operators. There are possible
interpretations of the Communications Act that could severely limit the ability of
service providers to collect and use personal information for commercial purposes.
Further constraints could be imposed if and to the extent that state or local authorities
establish their own privacy standards. In addition, the FCC and the FTC have adopted
rules that limit the telemarketing practices of cable operators and other commercial
entities.

•

Copyright
Regulation:

In exchange for filing certain reports and contributing a percentage of their
revenue to a U.S. federal copyright royalty pool, cable operators can obtain blanket
permission to retransmit copyrighted material on broadcast signals. The U.S. Copyright
Office has recommended that Congress revise this compulsory licensing scheme, although
Congress has thus far declined to do so. The elimination or

- 11 -

substantial modification of
the cable compulsory license could adversely affect our ability to obtain certain
programming and substantially increase our programming costs. Further, the Copyright
Office has not yet made any determinations as to how the compulsory license will apply to
digital broadcast signals and services. In addition, we pay standard industry licensing
fees to use music in the programs we provide to subscribers, including local advertising,
local origination programming and pay-per-view events. These licensing fees have been the
source of litigation between the cable industry and music performance rights
organizations in the past, and we cannot predict with certainty whether license fee
disputes may arise in the future.

•

Other
Areas:

The FCC actively regulates other aspects of our cable business, including, among
other things: (1) the mandatory blackout of syndicated, network, and sports programming;
(2) customer service standards; (3) advertising in children's programming; (4) political
advertising; (5) origination cablecasting; (6) sponsorship identification; (7) closed
captioning of video programming; (8) equal employment opportunity; (9) lottery
programming; (10) emergency alert systems; and (11) technical standards relating to
operation of the cable network. The FCC is not considering any significant revisions to
these rules at this time, but we are unable to predict how these regulations might be
changed in the future and how any such changes might affect our business.

In
all these areas and a variety of others, we face the potential of increased regulation.
Given the intensely competitive nature of every aspect of our business, we believe that
increased regulation is not warranted. We can not provide any assurance, however, that
regulation of our business will not increase.

EMPLOYEES

As
of December 31, 2003, we had approximately 68,000 employees. Of these employees,
approximately 59,000 were associated with cable and approximately 9,000 were associated
with our other divisions. Approximately 3,000 of our employees are covered by collective
bargaining agreements or have organized but are not covered by collective bargaining
agreements. We believe that our relationships with our employees are good.

ITEM 2

PROPERTIES

Cable

A
central receiving apparatus, distribution cables, servers, analog and digital converters,
cable modems, customer service call centers and local business offices are the principal
physical assets of a cable system. We own or lease the receiving and distribution
equipment of each system and own or lease parcels of real property for the receiving
sites, customer service call centers and local business offices.

Content

Two
large multi-purpose arenas, television studios and business offices are the principal
physical assets of our content operations. We own the arenas and own or lease the
television studios and business offices of our content operations.

We
believe that substantially all of our physical assets are in good operating condition.

ITEM 3

LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS

At Home.

Litigation
has been filed against us as a result of our alleged conduct with respect to our
investment in and distribution relationship with At Home Corporation. At Home was a
provider of high-speed Internet services that filed for bankruptcy protection in September
2001. Filed actions are: (i) class action lawsuits against us, Brian L. Roberts (our
President and Chief Executive Officer and a director), AT&T (the former controlling
shareholder of At Home and also a former distributor of the At Home service) and other
corporate and individual defendants in the Superior Court of San Mateo County, California,
alleging breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with transactions agreed to in March
2000 among At Home, AT&T, Cox Communications, Inc. (Cox is also an investor in At Home
and a former distributor of the At Home service) and us; (ii) class action lawsuits
against Comcast Cable Communications, LLC, AT&T and others in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging securities law violations
and common law fraud in connection with disclosures made by At Home in 2001; (iii) a
lawsuit brought in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in

- 12 -

the name of At Home by certain At Home bondholders against us, Brian L.
Roberts, Cox and others, alleging breaches of fiduciary duty relating to the March 2000
transactions and seeking recovery of alleged short-swing profits of at least $600 million
pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 purported to have arisen
in connection with certain transactions relating to At Home stock effected pursuant to
the March 2000 agreements; and (iv) a lawsuit brought in the United States Bankruptcy
Court for the Northern District of California by certain At Home bondholders against
Comcast Cable Holdings, LLC and Comcast Cable Communications Holdings, Inc., as well as AT&T,
AT&T Credit Holdings, Inc. and AT&T Wireless Services, Inc., seeking to avoid and
recover certain alleged “preference” payments in excess of $89 million
allegedly made to the defendants prior to the At Home bankruptcy filing. The actions in
San Mateo County, California have been stayed by the United States Bankruptcy Court for
the Northern District of California, the court in which At Home filed for bankruptcy, as
violating the automatic bankruptcy stay. In the Southern District of New York actions,
the court ordered the actions consolidated into a single action. All of the defendants
served motions to dismiss on February 11, 2003. The court dismissed the common law claims
against us and Mr. Roberts, leaving only a claim against them for “control person” liability
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In a subsequent decision, the court limited
the remaining claim against us and Mr. Roberts to disclosures that are alleged to have
been made by At Home prior to August 28, 2000. The Delaware case has been transferred to
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and we have moved
to dismiss the Section 16(b) claims.

Under
the terms of the Broadband acquisition, we are generally contractually liable for 50% of
any liabilities of AT&T relating to At Home, including most liabilities resulting from
any pending or threatened litigation, with the exception, among other things, of
liabilities arising out of contracts between At Home and AT&T (or its affiliates) for
the benefit of the businesses retained by AT&T following the divestiture of Broadband.
In those situations where we are contractually liable for 50% of any liabilities, AT&T
will be liable for the other 50% of these liabilities. In addition to the actions against
AT&T described above, where we are also a defendant, there are two additional actions
brought by At Home’s bondholders’ liquidating trust against AT&T, not naming
us: (i) a lawsuit filed against AT&T and certain of its senior officers in Santa
Clara, California state court alleging various breaches of fiduciary duties,
misappropriation of trade secrets and other causes of action in connection with the
transactions in March 2000 described above, and prior and subsequent alleged conduct on
the part of the defendants, and (ii) an action filed against AT&T in the District
Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that AT&T infringes an At Home
patent by using its broadband distribution and high-speed Internet backbone networks and
equipment. Both of these actions are in the discovery stage.

We
deny any wrongdoing in connection with the claims that have been made directly against us,
our subsidiaries and Brian L. Roberts, and intend to defend all of these claims
vigorously. In our opinion, the final disposition of these claims is not expected to have
a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, but could possibly be
material to our consolidated results of operations of any one period. Further, no
assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our consolidated
financial position.

We
are currently waiting to obtain additional information, and, therefore, are unable to
determine what impact, if any, the final resolution of our share of these AT&T At Home
potential liabilities would have on our consolidated financial position or results of
operations. No assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material.

AT&T.

We,
in connection with our acquisition of Broadband, are potentially responsible for a portion
of the liabilities arising from two purported securities class action lawsuits brought
against AT&T and others and consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States
District Court for the District of New Jersey. These lawsuits assert claims under Section
11, Section 12(a)(2) and Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section
10(b) and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The first
lawsuit, for which our portion of the exposure is up to 15%, alleges, among other things,
that AT&T made material misstatements and omissions in the Registration Statement and
Prospectus for the AT&T Wireless initial public offering. The second lawsuit, for
which our portion of the exposure is up to 50%, alleges, among other things, that AT&T
knowingly provided false projections relating to AT&T common stock. The complaints
seek damages in an unspecified amount, but because the trading activity during the
purported class periods was extensive the amounts ultimately demanded may be significant.
We and AT&T believe that AT&T has meritorious defenses and these actions are being
vigorously defended. The parties are currently engaged in discovery and
motions for summary judgment were filed in March 2004.

On
June 24, 1998, the first of a number of purported class action lawsuits was filed by
then-shareholders of Tele-Communications, Inc. (“TCI”) Series A TCI Group Common
Stock (“Common A”) against AT&T and the

- 13 -

directors of TCI relating to the acquisition of TCI by AT&T. A
consolidated amended complaint combining the various different actions was filed on
February 10, 1999 in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The consolidated amended complaint
alleges that former members of the TCI board of directors breached their fiduciary duties
to Common A shareholders by agreeing to transaction terms whereby holders of the Series B
TCI Group Common Stock received a 10% premium over what Common A shareholders received in
connection with the transaction. The complaint further alleges that AT&T aided and
abetted the TCI directors’ breach.

In
connection with the TCI acquisition, which was completed in early 1999, AT&T agreed
under certain circumstances to indemnify TCI’s former directors for certain losses,
expenses, claims or liabilities, potentially including those incurred in connection with
this action. In connection with the Broadband acquisition, Broadband agreed to indemnify
AT&T for certain losses, expenses, claims or liabilities. Those losses and expenses
potentially include those incurred by AT&T in connection with this action, both as a
defendant and in connection with any obligation that AT&T may have to indemnify the
former TCI directors for liabilities incurred as a result of the claims against them in
this action.

On
September 8, 1999, AT&T moved to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a
cause of action against AT&T. On July 7, 2003, the Delaware Court of Chancery granted
AT&T’s motion to dismiss on the ground that the complaint failed to adequately
plead AT&T’s “knowing participation,” as required to state a claim for
aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty. The other claims made in the complaint
remain outstanding. Discovery in this matter is now closed.

In
our opinion, the final disposition of these claims is not expected to have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, but could possibly be material to
our consolidated results of operations of any one period. Further, no assurance can be
given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our consolidated financial
position.

Liberty Digital.

On
January 8, 2003, Liberty Digital, Inc. filed a complaint in Colorado state court against
us and Comcast Cable Holdings, LLC. The complaint alleges that Comcast Cable Holdings
breached a 1997 “contribution agreement” between Liberty Digital and Comcast
Cable Holdings and that we tortiously interfered with that agreement. The complaint
alleges that this purported agreement obligates Comcast Cable Holdings to pay fees to
Liberty Digital totaling $18 million (increasing at CPI) per year through 2017. Liberty
Digital seeks, among other things, compensatory damages, specific performance of the
purported agreement, a declaration that the agreement is valid and enforceable going
forward, and an unspecified amount of exemplary damages from us based on the alleged
intentional interference claim. We and Comcast Cable Holdings filed our answer to the
complaint on March 5, 2003, in which we denied the essential allegations of the complaint
and asserted various affirmative defenses.

On
November 6, 2003, Liberty Digital was granted leave to file an amended complaint that
contained one minor revision to the original complaint. On December 16, 2003, we and
Comcast Cable Holdings filed our answer to the amended complaint, in which we again denied
the essential allegations of the complaint and asserted various affirmative defenses.
Discovery in this matter is currently underway and a trial is scheduled to commence on May
31, 2004.

In
our opinion, the final disposition of these claims is not expected to have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, but could possibly be material to
our consolidated results of operations of any one period. Further, no assurance can be
given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our consolidated financial
position.

Other.

We
are subject to other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our
business. In our opinion, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such actions is
not expected to materially affect our financial condition, results of operations or
liquidity.

ITEM 7

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

Comcast
is principally involved in the management and operation of cable communications networks
and in the management of programming content over cable and satellite television networks.
In 2003, we received over 95% of our revenue from our cable operations, primarily through
monthly subscriptions to our video, high-speed Internet and phone services, and
advertising. Subscribers typically pay us monthly, based on rates and related charges that
vary according to their chosen level of service and the type of equipment they use.
Revenue from our national television networks is derived from the sale of advertising time
and affiliation agreements with cable and satellite television companies.

Highlights for the year 2003 included the
following:

•

Integration
of Broadband acquisition

•

We
improved the profitability of the Broadband systems, increasing revenues and operating
margins.

•

We
increased the number of basic  subscribers  in the Broadband  systems,  reversing  their
 three-year  trend of          losses prior to our acquisition.

•

We
 accelerated  our upgrade  program.  By the end of 2003,  93% of our acquired  systems
 have been  upgraded to          provide two-way digital cable and high-speed Internet
service.

•

Continued
growth in our new services such as digital cable and high-speed  Internet.  Digital cable
grew 15.6% to 7.7      million subscribers while high-speed Internet grew 45.9% to 5.3
million subscribers.

•

We
reduced our total debt  outstanding  by $7.9 billion  primarily  with  proceeds  received
from the sale of QVC and      related Liberty Notes, the TWE restructuring and other
transactions.

The
following provides the details of these highlights and insights into our company’s
financial statements, including critical accounting judgments and estimates used in
preparing the financial statements, our liquidity and capital resources, and a discussion
of our results of operations.

Business Developments

We
have grown significantly in recent years through both strategic acquisitions and growth in
our existing businesses. On November 18, 2002, we completed the acquisition of AT&T
Corp.‘s broadband business, which we refer to as “Broadband.” The Broadband
acquisition substantially increased the size of our cable operations and caused
significant changes in our capital structure, including a substantially higher amount of
debt. As a result, direct comparisons of our results of operations for periods prior to
November 18, 2002 to subsequent periods are not meaningful. See

“Results of
Continuing Operations”

for a discussion of the effects of the Broadband acquisition
on our results of operations.

On
September 17, 2003 we completed the sale to Liberty Media Corporation of our approximate
57% interest in QVC, Inc. for approximately $7.7 billion. We received from Liberty $4.0
billion of three-year senior unsecured floating rate notes, approximately 218 million
shares of Liberty Series A common stock valued at $2.339 billion and cash of $1.35
billion. QVC has been presented as a discontinued operation in our financial statements.
Refer to

Note 5

to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for
more information on the sale of QVC.

Refer
to “General Developments of Our Business” in Part I and Note 5 to our financial
statements included in Item 8 for a discussion of our acquisitions and other
significant events.

Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates

We
believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the impairment testing and
valuation of our cable franchise rights, and the valuation of acquisition related assets,
liabilities and legal contingencies, to be critical in the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these
critical accounting judgments and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of
Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them presented
below.

Impairment Testing
and Valuation of Cable Franchise Rights

Our
cable systems are constructed and operated under non-exclusive franchises granted by state
or local governmental authorities for varying lengths of time. As of December 31, 2003, we
served approximately 4,400 franchise areas in the United States. We have concluded that
our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal,
regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors limiting the period over
which these rights will contribute to our cash flows. Accordingly, our cable franchise
rights are not subject to amortization but are assessed periodically for impairment in
accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

- 19 -

We have acquired these
franchise rights either directly from local franchise authorities or through many
separate cable system acquisitions that include multiple franchise territories. Upon
acquisition, we integrate the individual franchise territories into our national
footprint, typically by incorporating the management of those territories into our
existing geographic regions. We control the sourcing of content, pricing, marketing and
branding, and capital deployment throughout the company, as if our cable franchise rights
were a single asset. Therefore, we have concluded the franchise rights are operated as a
single asset within our cable segment. From time to time, however, the franchise rights
are separated and sold in units below the cable segment level. We have concluded that
Emerging Issues Task Force 02-07, “Unit of Accounting for Testing Impairment of
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets,” supports the testing of our cable franchise
rights for impairment at a level no higher than where the assets both are operated
together

and

are essentially inseparable. During 2002 and 2003, we tested our cable
franchise rights for impairment at the cable segment level. Effective in the first
quarter of 2004, we will change the unit of accounting used for testing impairment to
geographic regions and will perform impairment testing on our cable franchise rights.  We
do not anticipate recording any impairment charge in connection with the impairment
testing.

We
assess the recoverability of our cable franchise rights annually or more frequently
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. We estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on
multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization generated by the
underlying assets, discounted cash flow analyses, analyses of current market transactions,
and profitability information, including estimated future operating results, trends or
other determinants of fair value. If the value of our cable franchise rights determined by
these evaluations is less than its carrying amount, an impairment charge would be
recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of
the assets. Future adverse changes in market conditions or in the operating results of the
related business may indicate an inability to recover the carrying value of the assets,
thereby possibly requiring a future impairment charge.

The carrying amount of cable franchise
rights related to some of our historical cable systems is significantly less than their
current estimated fair value largely because we acquired many of these rights directly
from local franchise authorities rather than through separate cable system acquisitions.
Conversely, the carrying amount of cable franchise rights for our more recent cable system
acquisitions has not been significantly reduced through amortization (and has not been
reduced at all for acquisitions made subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 142).
Nevertheless, testing for impairment at a level higher than the individual franchise
agreement or cable system level reduces the likelihood of a future impairment charge
related to our cable franchise rights.

As
more fully described in Note 5 to our financial statements included in Item 8 (see

Acquisition of Broadband

), the fair value of the shares issued for Broadband was
based on the date the non-equity, or “other,” consideration being paid was
substantively changed from the terms of the original merger agreement. The fair value of
the shares issued for Broadband based on the new measurement date was approximately
one-half the fair value of the shares as of the date of the original merger agreement.
Accordingly, the effect of the modification was to reduce by approximately one-half
(approximately $23 billion) the value assigned to the equity consideration issued in
connection with the Broadband acquisition. The reduction in the fair value of the equity
consideration reduces the likelihood of a future impairment charge related to our
goodwill.

Fair Value of
Acquisition Related Assets, Liabilities and Legal Contingencies

We
allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets
acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. In determining fair
value, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded
amounts. To assist in this process, third party valuation specialists are engaged to value
certain of these assets and liabilities.

Estimates
used in valuing acquired assets and liabilities include but are not limited to: expected
future cash flows, market rate assumptions for contractual obligations, actuarial
assumptions for benefit plans, settlement plans for litigation and contingencies, and
appropriate discount rates. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions
believed to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain. In addition, estimated
liabilities to exit activities of the acquired operations, including the exiting of
contractual obligations and the termination of employees, are subject to change as we
complete the implementation of the plan.

The
assets and assumed liabilities related to the Broadband acquisition that required
significant judgment in estimating fair value included investments, cable franchise
rights, franchise related customer relationships, assumed contractual and other
obligations, and costs related to terminating certain of Broadband’s contractual
obligations and employees. In addition, we are party to certain legal contingencies,
including those described in Item 3, Legal Proceedings. If, based on information
available, a potential loss arising from the lawsuits, claims and actions involving
AT&T or Broadband was deemed

- 20 -

probable and reasonably estimable or the fair value of the contingency
could be determined, we recorded the liability in the purchase price allocation. For
certain other cases, we are awaiting additional information to determine if a liability
should be recorded. In addition, the inherent limitations in the estimation process may
cause future actual losses to exceed expected losses.

Significant and Subjective Estimates

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is
based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of
these financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets
and contingent liabilities (such as income taxes and litigation). We base our judgments on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.

Refer
to

Note 2

to our financial statements included in Item 8 for a discussion of our
accounting policies with respect to these and other items.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

During
2003, we significantly strengthened our balance sheet and increased our liquidity through
the repayment and refinancing of debt, and through the sales or restructurings of certain
of our investments, which are more fully described below (see

Financing

on page
23).

Anticipated Sources of Liquidity

We
believe that we will be able to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital
requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities,
existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, through available borrowings under our
existing credit facilities, and through our ability to obtain future external financing.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents

We
have traditionally maintained significant levels of cash and cash equivalents to meet our
short-term liquidity requirements. As of December 31, 2003, our cash and cash
equivalents totaled $1.55 billion, substantially all of which is unrestricted.

Investments

Investments
that we determine to be non-strategic, highly-valued or both, are considered by us to be a
source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2003, we consider our investments in the following
to be potential sources of liquidity:

•

$1.5
billion in Time Warner Inc. common equivalent preferred stock,

•

$1.4
billion in Liberty common stock,

•

21%
interest in Time Warner Cable Inc., and

•

interests
in certain cable television partnerships.

We
do not have any significant contractual funding commitments with respect to any of our
investments.

Refer
to

Note 6

to our financial statements included in Item 8 for a discussion of our
investments.

Available Borrowings
Under Credit Facilities

We
have traditionally maintained significant availability under our lines of credit to meet
our short-term liquidity requirements. As of December 31, 2003, amounts available under
our lines of credit totaled $5.876 billion.

On
January 8, 2004, we refinanced three of our existing revolving credit facilities with a
new $4.5 billion, five-year revolving bank credit facility due January 2009. As of January
8, 2004, remaining amounts available under our lines of credit totaled $4.381 billion (see

Debt Covenants

on page 24).

Anticipated Uses of Cash

Capital Expenditures

Our
most significant recurring investing activity has been and is expected to continue to be
capital expenditures. During 2004, however, we expect cable capital expenditures to
decline compared to 2003 as we complete the upgrade of our cable systems.

We
expect to incur approximately $3.4 billion of capital expenditures in our cable and
content businesses, substantially all of which will be in our cable business. As of
December 31, 2003, we do not have any significant contractual obligations for capital
expenditures. The amount of our capital expenditures for 2004 and for subsequent years
will depend on numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:

•

competition,

•

changes
in technology, and

•

the
timing and rate of deployment of new services.

- 21 -

The
following table illustrates the capital expenditures we incurred in our cable business
during 2003 and expect to incur in 2004 (in millions):



Upgrading of certain cable systems

$1,414

$760

Deployment of cable modems, digital converters,

and new service offerings

1,923

1,880

Recurring capital projects



Total capital expenditures

$4,097

$3,350

Interest

During
2003, we made cash payments for interest totaling $2.053 billion. We anticipate that, for
the foreseeable future, our cash paid interest will decline modestly as average debt
balances decline, but will remain significant.

Income Taxes

During
2003, we made cash payments for income taxes totaling $945 million, primarily as a result
of our sale of QVC and certain of our other investments. We anticipate that our cash paid
for income taxes will be significantly reduced in 2004.

Stock Repurchases

In
December 2003, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of our
outstanding common equity securities. We expect such repurchases to occur from time to
time, in the open market or in private transactions, subject to market conditions.

Affiliation Agreements

Certain
of our content subsidiaries enter into multi-year affiliation agreements with various
cable and satellite television system operators for carriage of their respective
programming. In connection with these affiliation agreements, we generally pay a launch
fee to the cable or satellite television operator based upon the number of subscribers.
During 2004, we expect to incur fees of no more than $150 million related to these
affiliation agreements, excluding amounts applicable to our cable systems.

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements

We
do not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to
have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Contractual
Obligations

Our
unconditional contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003, which consist primarily of
our debt obligations, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our
liquidity and cash flow in future periods, are summarized in the table below.

Purchase
 obligations  consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are  enforceable
and legally binding      on us and that  specify  all  significant  terms  including
 fixed  or  minimum  quantities  to be  purchased,  price      provisions and timing of
the transaction.  Our purchase obligations include payments under the employment
 agreements      that we, through  Comcast  Spectacor,  have with both players and
coaches of our  professional  sports teams that are      guaranteed  regardless of
employee  injury or termination.  Certain of these  agreements may be covered by
disability      insurance if certain  conditions are met. Also included are payments
under license  agreements  that our  programming      networks  have  entered into for
programs and  sporting  events that will be  available  for telecast  subsequent  to
     December 31, 2003.  Also included are the minimum  guaranteed  payments  under
 programming  contracts that our cable      segment enters into for the purchase of
programming from cable network providers.  We have also included  commitments      to
purchase cable related equipment. We did not include contracts with immaterial future
commitments.

Acquisition
 related  obligations  consist  primarily of costs related to  terminating  employees,
 costs relating to      exiting contractual obligations, and other assumed contractual
obligations of the acquired entity.

(3)

Other
long-term  obligations  consist  principally of our prepaid forward  transactions on
equity securities we hold,      subsidiary  preferred  shares,  deferred  compensation
 obligations,  pension,  post-retirement  and  post-employment      benefit obligations,
and program rights payable under license agreements.

Financing

As
of December 31, 2003 and 2002, our debt, including capital lease obligations, was
$26.996 billion and $34.909 billion, respectively. The $7.913 billion decrease from
December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003 results from our net debt repayments and
non-cash financing transactions during 2003. Included in our debt as of December 31, 2003
and 2002 was short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt of $3.161 billion and
$6.953 billion, respectively.

We
have, and may from time to time in the future, depending on certain factors including
market conditions, make optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include
open market repurchases of our outstanding public notes and debentures.

The Cross-Guarantee
Structure

To
simplify our capital structure, we and a number of our wholly-owned subsidiaries that hold
substantially all of our cable communications assets have unconditionally guaranteed each
other’s debt securities and indebtedness for borrowed money, including amounts
outstanding under the new credit facilities. As of December 31, 2003, $20.866 billion
of our debt was included in the cross-guarantee structure.

Comcast
Holdings is not a guarantor and none of its debt is guaranteed under the cross-guarantee
structure. As of December 31, 2003, $1.024 billion of our debt was outstanding at
Comcast Holdings.

Debt Covenants

We
and our cable subsidiaries that have provided guarantees are subject to the covenants and
restrictions set forth in the indentures governing our public debt securities and in the
credit agreement governing our bank credit facilities. We and the guarantors are in
compliance with the covenants and we believe that neither the covenants nor the
restrictions in our indentures or loan documents will limit our ability to operate our
business or raise additional capital. The two financial covenants in our bank credit
facility are tested on an ongoing basis and measure our leverage and interest coverage. We
have significant headroom under these financial covenants. The entire amount of our new
$4.5 billion bank credit facility is currently available for our use, and future
compliance with our financial covenants is not dependent on further debt reduction or on
improved operating results.

Exchangeable Notes

We
have outstanding notes exchangeable into the common stock of Cablevision NY Group
(“Cablevision”) Class A common stock, Microsoft Corporation
(“Microsoft”) common stock, Vodafone ADRs and Comcast Class A Special common
stock (together, the “Exchangeable Notes”). At maturity the Exchangeable Notes
are mandatorily redeemable at our option into (i) a number of shares of common stock or
ADRs equal to the underlying shares multiplied by an exchange ratio (as defined), or (ii)
its cash equivalent. The maturity value of the Exchangeable Notes varies based upon the
fair market value of the security to which it is indexed. The Exchangeable Notes are
collateralized by our investments in Cablevision, Microsoft and Vodafone, respectively.

The
Comcast exchangeable notes are collateralized by our Class A Special common stock held in
treasury. We have and intend in the future to settle the Comcast exchangeable notes using
cash.

During
2003, we settled $1.851 billion of our obligations relating to certain of our Exchangeable
Notes by delivering the underlying shares of common stock or cash to the counterparty upon
maturity of the instruments, and the equity collar agreements related to the underlying
shares expired or were settled.

As
of December 31, 2003, our debt includes an aggregate of $4.318 billion of Exchangeable
Notes, including $2.427 billion and $1.891 billion within current portion of long-term
debt and long-term debt, respectively. As of December 31, 2003, the securities held by us
collateralizing the Exchangeable Notes were

- 24 -

sufficient to satisfy the debt obligations associated with the
outstanding Exchangeable Notes.

Interest Rate Risk
Management

We
are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates. We maintain a mix of
fixed and variable rate debt and enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to
our policies to manage the volatility relating to these exposures.

We
monitor our interest rate risk exposures using techniques including market value and
sensitivity analyses. We do not hold or issue any derivative financial instruments for
trading purposes and are not a party to leveraged instruments.

We
manage the credit risks associated with our derivative financial instruments through the
evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of the counterparties. Although we may
be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties, we do not
expect such losses, if any, to be significant.

We
use the following derivative financial instruments to manage the market risk of adverse
changes in interest rates:

•

Interest
rate exchange agreements ("Swaps") to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference
between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon
notional principal amount;

•

Interest
rate lock agreements ("Rate Locks") to hedge the risk that cash flows related to the
interest payments on an anticipated issuance or assumption of fixed rate debt may be
adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations;

•

Interest
rate cap agreements ("Caps") to lock in a maximum interest rate should variable rates
rise, but enable us to otherwise pay lower market rates; and

•

Interest
rate collar agreements ("Collars") to limit our exposure to and benefits from interest
rate fluctuations on variable rate debt to within a certain range of rates.

While
Swaps, Rate Locks, Caps and Collars represent an integral part of our interest rate risk
management program, their effect on interest expense for the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001 was not significant. However, Swaps, Rate Locks, Caps and Collars may
have a significant effect on our interest expense in the future.

The
table set forth below summarizes the fair values and contract terms of financial
instruments subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of December 31, 2003
(dollars in millions):

The
notional amounts of interest rate instruments, as presented in the table above, are used
to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the amount of exposure to
credit loss. The estimated fair value approximates the proceeds to settle the outstanding
contracts. We estimate interest rates on variable debt using the average implied forward
London Interbank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”) rates for the year of maturity based

- 25 -

on the yield curve in effect at December 31, 2003, plus the
borrowing margin in effect for each credit facility at December 31, 2003. We
estimate the floating rates on our Swaps using the average implied forward LIBOR rates
for the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect at December 31, 2003.

Excluding
the effects of interest rate risk management instruments, 8.2% of our total debt as of
December 31, 2003 was at variable rates, compared to 31.8% at December 31, 2002. The
decrease from December 31, 2002 in the percentage of our variable rate debt was due to the
repayment of substantially all of our variable rate bank debt during 2003.

As a matter of practice,
we typically do not structure our financial contracts to include credit ratings-based
triggers that could affect our liquidity. In the ordinary course of business, certain of
our Swaps could be subject to termination provisions if we do not maintain
investment-grade credit ratings. As of December 31, 2003, the fair value of the liability
related to those Swaps was approximately $19 million. The amount due upon termination, if
any, would be based upon the fair value of those outstanding contracts at that time.

Equity Price Risk
Management

We
are exposed to the market risk of changes in the equity prices of certain of our
investments accounted for as trading securities. We enter into various derivative
transactions pursuant to our policies to manage the volatility relating to these
exposures.

We
monitor our equity price risk exposures to ensure that the instruments are matched with
the underlying assets or liabilities, reduce our risks relating to equity prices, and
through market value and sensitivity analyses, maintain a high correlation to the risk
inherent in the hedged item.

We
use the following derivative financial instruments, which we account for at fair value, to
limit our exposure to and benefits from price fluctuations in the common stock of certain
of our investments accounted for as trading securities:

•

Cashless
collar agreements ("Equity Collars");

•

Prepaid
forward sales agreements ("Prepaid Forward Sales");

•

Indexed
debt instruments ("Exchangeable Notes").

Except
as described in

Results of Continuing Operations — Investment Income (Loss), Net on
page 31

, the changes in the fair value of our investments accounted for as trading
securities were substantially offset by the changes in the fair values of the Equity
Collars and the derivative components of the Exchangeable Notes and the Prepaid Forward
Sales.

accounting policies with respect to derivative financial instruments and to Notes


and


to our financial statements included in Item 8 for discussions of our derivative financial
instruments.

Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income (Loss)

The
components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) primarily are unrealized
losses on our Rate Locks, offset by unrealized gains and losses on available for sale
securities. Changes to these components account for the change in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003. Refer to

Notes 6

and 8

to our financial statements included in Item 8 for more information about these
components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Statement of Cash Flows

Cash
and cash equivalents increased $1.045 billion as of December 31, 2003 from
December 31, 2002. The increase in cash and cash equivalents resulted from cash flows
from operating, financing and investing activities as explained below.

Net
cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations amounted to $2.854
billion for the year ended December 31, 2003, due principally to our operating income
before depreciation and amortization (see

“Results of Continuing Operations”

),
the effects of interest and income tax payments, and changes in operating assets and liabilities as a result of the timing of receipts
and disbursements.

Net
cash used in financing activities from continuing operations consists primarily of
borrowings and repayments of debt. Net cash used in financing activities from continuing
operations was $7.048 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003. During 2003, we
borrowed $9.398 billion, consisting principally of:

•

$3.988
billion of senior notes,

•

$3.707
billion under revolving credit facilities, and

•

$1.650
billion under a term loan due 2006.

During
2003, we repaid $16.465 billion of our debt, consisting principally of:

•

$4.830
billion of our term loans,

- 26 -

•

$4.496
billion on certain of our revolving credit facilities,

•

$3.750
billion of short-term debt,

•

$1.959
billion of our senior and medium term notes,

•

$517
million of Trust Preferred Securities, and

•

$498
million of exchangeable debt.

Net
cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations was $5.239 billion for
the year ended December 31, 2003. During 2003, proceeds from investing activities include
sales, settlements and restructuring of investments as listed in the table under

Financing

on page 24, offset, in part, by capital expenditures of $4.161 billion.

Results of Continuing Operations

Revenues

Consolidated
revenues for the years 2003 and 2002 increased $10.2 billion and $2.2 billion,
respectively, from the previous year. Of these increases, $10.1 billion and $2.0 billion,
respectively, relate to our cable segment, which is discussed separately below. The
remaining increases are primarily the result of our content businesses, which achieved
combined revenue growth of 15.4% and 26.5%, during the years 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Such increases in the content businesses were primarily the result of increases in
distribution revenues, increases in advertising revenues and the effects of our 2001
acquisitions.

Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses

Consolidated
operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for the years 2003 and 2002
increased $6.7 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, from the previous year. Of these
increases, $6.6 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, relate to our cable segment, which
is discussed separately below. The remaining increases are primarily the result of growth
in our content businesses and increases in corporate overhead.

Depreciation

The
increases in depreciation expense for the years 2003 and 2002 are primarily attributable
to our cable segment. The increases in our cable segment are principally due to the
effects of the Broadband acquisition, as well as our increased levels of capital
expenditures.

Amortization

The
increase in amortization expense for the year 2003 is primarily attributable to our cable
segment. The increase in our cable segment is principally due to the effects of the
Broadband acquisition. As a result of the Broadband acquisition, we recorded approximately
$3.4 billion of franchise-related customer relationship intangible assets, which we are
amortizing over their average estimated useful life of approximately four years.

The
decrease in amortization expense for the year 2002 is primarily attributable to our cable
segment, principally due to the effects of the adoption of SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002
as we no longer amortize goodwill or franchise rights intangible assets. This decrease is
partially offset by the effects of the Broadband acquisition.

Cable Segment Operating Results

The
discussion of our cable segment historical operating results is presented as a comparison
of the 2003, 2002 and 2001 periods, which only include the Broadband results subsequent to
November 18, 2002. In order to provide additional information relating to our cable
segment operating results, we also present a comparison of 2003 actual results to 2002
results on a pro forma basis. Management uses pro forma data to evaluate performance when
significant acquisitions or dispositions occur. Historical data reflects results of
acquired businesses only after the acquisition dates while pro forma data enhances
comparability of financial information between periods by adjusting the data as if the acquisitions (or
dispositions) occurred at the beginning of the prior year. Our pro forma data is only
adjusted for the timing of acquisitions and does not include adjustments for costs
related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that have or may be achieved
by the combined businesses. In the opinion of management, this information is not
indicative of what our results would have been had we operated Broadband since January 1,
2002, nor of our future results (amounts in millions).

- 27 -

2003 to 2002 Pro Forma Comparisons

Our
2003 cable operating results reflect revenue growth of 9.1% and operating income before
depreciation and amortization growth of 42.1% compared to the pro forma 2002 year. The
growth in revenue is primarily the result of growth in basic, digital cable and high-speed
Internet subscribers, and rate increases. The increase in high-speed Internet subscribers
reflects increased consumer demand for the faster and more reliable Internet service
provided over our cable networks. The increase in our video subscribers was driven by an
increase of approximately 117,000 subscribers in 2003 in the Broadband systems that
reversed a loss of approximately 483,000 subscribers in 2002. The growth in digital cable
subscribers reflects increased demand for additional programming choices and enhancements
in digital service packages. Rate increases occurred in our traditional video service, as
well as from the repricing and repackaging of the digital and premium channel products in
the Broadband systems.

The
2003 operating income before depreciation and amortization results reflect the significant
operating trends and efficiencies achieved in integrating the Broadband operations. The
integration of Broadband involved changing the organizational structure and refocusing
priorities including:

•

Focusing
on selling video and high-speed Internet services, and emphasizing profitability over
subscriber growth in phone.

•

Accelerating
our upgrade of Broadband systems to deploy and market expanded services sooner. In 2003,
we upgraded over 53,000 miles versus 27,500 miles in pro forma 2002.

•

Renegotiating
programming contracts or achieving synergies in existing programming contracts. The
impact of these initiatives was to reduce the growth in our programming costs.

•

Reducing
redundant Broadband overhead functions.

(a)

Operating
income before depreciation and amortization is defined as operating income before
depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, if any, related to fixed and
intangible assets and gains or losses from the sale of
assets, if any. As such, it
eliminates the significant level of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense
that results from the capital intensive nature of our businesses and intangible
assets recognized in business combinations, and is unaffected by our capital
structure or investment activities. Our management and Board of Directors use
this measure in evaluating our consolidated operating performance and the operating
performance of all of our operating segments. This metric is used to allocate
resources and capital to our operating segments and is a significant component
of our annual incentive compensation programs. We believe that this measure is also
useful to investors as it is one of the bases for comparing our operating
performance with other companies in our industries, although our measure may
not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
Because we use operating

- 28 -

income before depreciation and amortization as the
measure of our segment profit or loss, we reconcile it to operating income, the
most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in
accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), in the business
segment footnote to our financial statements. This measure should not be
considered as a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net
cash provided by operating activities or other measures of performance or liquidity
reported in accordance with GAAP.

Revenues

Video
revenue consists of our basic, expanded basic, premium, pay-per-view, equipment and
digital cable services. The increase in video revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due
to increases in monthly average revenue per video subscriber as a result of rate increases
in our traditional video service, growth in digital subscribers, and repricing and
repackaging of the digital and premium channel services in the Broadband systems. From
December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003, we added approximately 140,000 basic subscribers
and over 1.0 million digital subscribers, or a 15.6% increase in digital subscribers. We
expect continued growth in our video services revenue.

The
increase in high-speed Internet revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to the addition
in 2003 of approximately 1.7 million high-speed Internet subscribers, or a 45.9% increase
in high-speed Internet subscribers, as well as to the effects of an increase in monthly
average revenue per subscriber. We expect continued revenue growth as overall demand for
our services continues to increase.

The
decrease in phone revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily as a result of our focus on
operating efficiencies to drive profitability in the phone business, rather than focusing
on subscriber growth. As a result, during 2003 our phone subscribers decreased by
approximately 171,000 subscribers.

The
increase in advertising sales revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to the effects of
growth in regional/national advertising as a result of the continuing success of our
regional interconnects, offset by reduced growth in a soft local advertising market.

Other
revenue includes installation revenues, guide revenues, commissions from electronic
retailing, revenue from our regional sports programming networks and reduced revenue from
other product offerings.

The
increase in franchise fees collected from our cable subscribers from 2002 to 2003 is
primarily attributable to the increase in our revenues upon which the fees apply.

Expenses

Total
expenses decreased $427 million or 3.7% in 2003 from 2002, which is primarily the result
of the effects of approximately $425 million of acquisition and employee termination
related costs recorded by Broadband in 2002. Excluding the effects of these costs, total
expenses were nearly level with the 2002 amounts. This is a result of cost efficiencies
generated from the integration of Broadband.

Programming
costs represent our single largest operating expense and represent fees paid to license
programming from cable and broadcast networks that we distribute, package and sell to our
video subscribers. Programming expenses are impacted by changes in programming rates, the
number of subscribers and programming channels. In 2003, programming costs increased 2.3%
as compared to 2002. During 2003, we were able to negotiate reductions in programming
rates, primarily in premium channels. We anticipate our programming costs will increase in
the future primarily as a result of increased cost to produce and purchase programming and
additional programming channels provided to our subscribers. These increases are
mitigated, to some extent, by additional volume discounts associated with our increased
size and future growth in subscribers receiving such programming channels.

Other
operating, selling and general and administrative expenses decreased from 2002 to 2003
primarily due to the effects of approximately $425 million of acquisition and employee
termination related costs recorded by Broadband in 2002. Additionally, in 2003, customer
service expenses slightly declined because we no longer outsource Broadband’s
customer service operations. We also reduced administrative and overhead
expenses through reductions in headcount and the elimination of
redundancies. Offsetting these decreases were increases in labor and other volume related
operating expenses associated with the growth in our high-speed Internet and digital
cable services.

.

Video
revenue increased $6.580 billion from 2002 to 2003, of which $6.286 billion is
attributable to the effects of the Broadband acquisition and $294 million relates to
changes in rates and subscriber growth in our historical operations, driven principally by
growth in our digital subscribers. During 2003, we added over 1.0 million digital
subscribers.

The
increase in high-speed Internet revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to the
Broadband acquisition and growth in high-speed Internet subscribers. During 2003, we added
approximately 1.7 million high-speed Internet subscribers.

The
increase in phone, advertising sales and other revenue is principally attributable to the
effects of the Broadband acquisition. Our historical operations prior to the Broadband
acquisition did not contain significant phone revenue.

The
increase in franchise fees collected from our cable subscribers from 2002 to 2003 is
primarily attributable to the increase in our revenues upon which the fees apply.

The
increase in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses from 2002 to 2003 is
primarily attributable to the effects of the Broadband acquisition, as well as to the
effects of an increase in the costs of cable programming, an increase in labor costs and
other volume-related expenses in our historical operations, and, to a lesser extent, to
the effect of high-speed Internet subscriber growth.

2002 to 2001 Historical Comparisons

- 30 -

Video
revenues increased $1.238 billion from 2001 to 2002, of which $945 million is attributable
to the effects of our acquisitions of cable systems and $293 million relates to changes in
rates and subscriber growth in our historical operations, driven principally by growth in
digital subscribers. During 2002, we added approximately 4.4 million digital subscribers
as a result of the Broadband acquisition and we added approximately 0.5 million digital
subscribers through growth in our historical operations.

The
increase in high-speed Internet revenue from 2001 to 2002 is primarily due to the addition
of high-speed Internet subscribers. During 2002, we added approximately 2.1 million
high-speed Internet subscribers as a result of the Broadband acquisition and we added
approximately 0.6 million high-speed Internet subscribers through growth in our historical
operations.

The
increase in advertising sales revenue from 2001 to 2002 is due to the effects of the
Broadband acquisition, as well as to the effects of a stronger advertising market and the
continued success of our regional interconnects.

The
increase from 2001 to 2002 in other revenue is primarily attributable to other product
revenues, including phone revenue, as a result of the Broadband acquisition. The remaining
increase from 2001 to 2002 is attributable to growth in our historical operations.

The
increase in franchise fees collected from our cable subscribers from 2001 to 2002 is
primarily attributable to the increases in our revenues upon which the fees apply.

The
increase in operating, selling, general and administrative expense from 2001 to 2002 is
primarily attributable to the effects of the Broadband acquisition, as well as to the
effect of an increase in the costs of cable programming, an increase in labor costs and
other volume-related expenses in our historical operations, and, to a lesser extent, to
the effect of high-speed Internet subscriber growth.

On
September 28, 2001, At Home Corporation (“At Home”), our former provider of
high-speed Internet services, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code. In October 2001, we amended our agreement with At Home to continue service to our
existing and new subscribers during October and November 2001. We agreed to be charged a
higher rate than we had incurred under our previous agreement. On December 3, 2001, we
reached a definitive agreement, approved by the Bankruptcy Court, with At Home pursuant to
which At Home agreed to continue to provide high-speed Internet services to our existing
and new subscribers through February 28, 2002. In December 2001, we began to transfer our
high-speed Internet subscribers from the At Home network to our new Comcast-owned and
managed network. We completed this transition in February 2002. Operating expenses in our
consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2001 include $140
million of net incremental expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2001 in the
continuation of service to and transition of our high-speed Internet subscribers from At
Home’s network to our network.

Consolidated Other Income (Expense) Items

Interest Expense

The
increases in interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 from the
previous year are due to our increased amount of debt outstanding as a result of the
Broadband acquisition.

Investment Income
(Loss), Net

Investment
income (loss), net for the years ended December, 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 includes the
following (in millions):

- 31 -

We
have entered into derivative financial instruments that we account for at fair value and
which economically hedge the market price fluctuations in the common stock of certain of
our investments accounted for as trading securities. Investment income (loss), net
includes the fair value adjustments related to our trading securities and derivative
financial instruments. The change in the fair value of our investments accounted for as
trading securities, with the exception in 2003 of the unrealized gain on 118 million
shares of our Liberty common shares discussed below, was substantially offset by the
changes in the fair value of the related derivatives.

Beginning
in 2003, we are exposed to changes in the fair value of 118 million shares of Liberty
common stock we hold and account for as a trading security as we have not entered into a
corresponding derivative to hedge this market exposure.

We
are also exposed to changes in the fair value of the derivative component of the Comcast
exchangeable notes we have outstanding since the underlying 30.9 million shares of Comcast
Class A Special common stock we hold in treasury are carried at our historical cost and
are not adjusted for changes in fair value.

Accordingly,
our future results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the fair value of both
the Liberty common stock and the derivative component of the Comcast exchangeable notes in
future periods.

Gains
(losses) on sales and exchanges of investments, net in 2001 relates principally to our
investment in At Home.

The
investment impairment losses relate principally to other than temporary declines in our
investment in AT&T.

In
connection with the reclassification of our investment in Sprint PCS from an available for
sale security to a trading security upon the adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001,
we reclassified to investment income (loss), net the accumulated unrealized gain of $1.092
billion on our investment in Sprint PCS that was previously recorded as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Equity in Net Losses
of Affiliates

Equity
in net losses of affiliates for 2003 results principally from the full-year impact of
losses of investees we acquired in the Broadband acquisition.

The
increase in equity in net losses of affiliates from 2001 to 2002 is primarily due to an
other than temporary decline in certain of our equity method investees, the effects of our
additional investments, a change in the net income or loss of our equity method investees,
as well as to the effects of the discontinuance of amortization of equity method goodwill
as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002.

Other Income

The
increase in other income from 2002 to 2003 is primarily attributable to lease rental
income related to certain assets acquired in the Broadband acquisition.

On
October 30, 2001, we acquired from Fox Entertainment Group, Inc. (“Fox
Entertainment”) the approximate 83.2% interest in Outdoor Life Network
(“OLN”) not previously owned by us. Upon closing of the acquisition, we
exchanged our 14.5% interest in Speedvision Network (“SVN”), together with a
previously made loan, for Fox Entertainment’s interest in OLN. In connection with the
exchange of our interest in SVN, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $107 million, representing
the difference between the estimated fair value of our interest in SVN as of the closing
date of the transaction and our cost basis in SVN.

On
January 1, 2001, we completed our cable systems exchange with Adelphia Communications
Corporation (“Adelphia”). We received cable systems serving approximately
445,000 subscribers from Adelphia and Adelphia received certain of our cable systems
serving approximately 441,000 subscribers. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $1.199 billion,
representing the difference between the estimated fair value of $1.799 billion as of the
closing date of the transaction and our cost basis in the systems exchanged.

Income Tax Benefit
(Expense)

The
changes in income tax benefit (expense) are primarily the result of the effects of changes
in our income before taxes and minority interest, and non-deductible goodwill amortization
in 2001.

Minority Interest

The
increases in minority interest are attributable to increases in the net income of our less
than wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries, as well as, in 2003, to dividends recorded to
minority interest related to certain subsidiaries acquired in the Broadband acquisition
prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments
with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.”

Discontinued operations

Income
from discontinued operations decreased from 2002 to 2003 primarily as a result of the 2003
period including QVC’s results through August 31, while the 2002 period includes
QVC’s results for the full year. As a result of the sale of QVC, we recognized a
$3.290 billion gain, net of approximately $2.865 billion of related income taxes.

Income
from discontinued operations decreased from 2001 to 2002 primarily as a result of an
investment loss recognized by QVC during 2002.

Cumulative Effect of
Accounting Change

Upon
adoption of SFAS No. 133, we recognized as income a cumulative effect of accounting
change, net of related income taxes, of $385 million during the year ended December 31,
2001. The income consisted of a $400 million adjustment to record the debt component of
our 2.0% Exchangeable Subordinated Debentures due 2029 at a discount from its value at
maturity and $192 million principally related to the reclassification of gains previously
recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on our equity
derivative instruments, net of related deferred income taxes of $207 million.

We
believe that our operations are not materially affected by inflation.

FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

INDEPENDENT
AUDITORS’ REPORT

Board of Directors and Stockholders

Comcast Corporation

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet of Comcast Corporation and its subsidiaries (the
“Company”) as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2003. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Comcast Corporation and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.

As discussed in

Note 2

to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,” as amended, effective January 1, 2001, and Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” effective
January 1, 2002.

ORGANIZATION
AND BUSINESS

We
were incorporated in December 2001 in order to acquire AT&T Corp.‘s broadband
business, which we refer to as “Broadband.” On November 18, 2002, we, Comcast
Holdings Corporation (“Comcast Holdings”) and AT&T completed a transaction
that resulted in the combination of Comcast Holdings and Broadband (the “Broadband
acquisition”). Upon completion of the Broadband acquisition, Comcast Holdings and
Broadband are our wholly owned subsidiaries, with Comcast Holdings as our predecessor.
Accordingly, the accompanying financial statements include the results of Comcast
Holdings for all periods presented and the results of Broadband from the date of the
Broadband acquisition (see

Note 5

).

Our
cable business is principally involved in the development, management and operation of
broadband communications networks in the United States. Our consolidated cable operations
served approximately 21.5 million subscribers as of December 31, 2003. Our cable business
represents our only reportable segment (see

Note 14

).

We
conduct the national networks of our content business through our consolidated
subsidiaries E! Entertainment Television, Inc., The Golf Channel (“TGC”),
Outdoor Life Network (“OLN”), and G4 Media, LLC. Our content business also
includes Comcast Spectator, our three 24-hour regional sports programming networks,
Comcast SportsNet (“CSN”), Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic (“CSN
Mid-Atlantic”) and Cable Sports Southeast (“CSS”), a fourth 24-hour
regional sports network, Comcast SportsNet Chicago (“CSN Chicago”), that we
anticipate will launch in October 2004, and our regional network, CN8. Our regional
networks are included in our cable segment as they derive a substantial portion of their
revenues from our cable operations and are managed by cable segment management.

On
September 17, 2003, we sold our approximate 57% interest in QVC, Inc., which markets a
wide variety of products directly to consumers primarily on merchandise-focused
television programs. Accordingly, we present QVC as a discontinued operation pursuant to
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 144, “Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (see

Note 5

).

SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of
Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include our accounts and all entities that we directly
or indirectly control. We have eliminated all significant intercompany accounts and
transactions among consolidated entities.

Variable Interest
Entities

We
account for our interests in variable interest special purpose entities (“SPEs”)
in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation
No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN 46”). We
consolidate all SPEs for which we are the primary beneficiary and for which the entities
do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved. We do not consolidate
variable interest entities that effectively disperse risks unless we hold an interest or
combination of interests that effectively recombines risks that were previously
dispersed. We adopted the initial recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 46
effective January 1, 2002. The adoption of FIN 46 had no impact on our financial
condition or results of operations. See

Note 3

for further discussion of FIN 46
interpretations and amendments.

Our Use of Estimates

We
prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Estimates are used when accounting for certain items, such as allowances for
doubtful accounts, investments and derivative financial instruments, depreciation and
amortization, asset impairment, non-monetary transactions, certain acquisition-related
liabilities, pensions and other postretirement benefits, income taxes and contingencies.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001 (Continued)

Fair Values

We
have determined the estimated fair value amounts presented in these consolidated
financial statements using available market information and appropriate methodologies.
However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the
estimates of fair value. The estimates presented in these consolidated financial
statements are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a
current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation
methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. We based
these fair value estimates on pertinent information available to us as of December 31,
2003 and 2002. We have not comprehensively updated these fair value estimates for
purposes of these consolidated financial statements since such dates.

Cash Equivalents

Cash
equivalents consist principally of commercial paper, money market funds, US Government
obligations and certificates of deposit with maturities of three months or less when
purchased. The carrying amounts of our cash equivalents approximate their fair values.

Investments

Investments
in entities in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the
operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for under the equity
method. Equity method investments are recorded at original cost and adjusted periodically
to recognize our proportionate share of the investees’ net income or losses after
the date of investment, amortization of basis differences, additional contributions made
and dividends received, and impairment losses resulting from adjustments to net
realizable value. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets,” on January 1, 2002, the goodwill resulting from differences
between our recorded investments and our proportionate interests in the book value of the
investees’ net assets were amortized to equity in net income or loss, primarily over
a period of 20 years. Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, we no longer amortize
such equity method goodwill (see

Notes 6

and 7

).

Unrestricted
publicly traded investments are classified as available for sale or trading securities
and recorded at their fair value. Unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in
fair value between measurement dates for available for sale securities are recorded as a
component of other comprehensive income (loss). Unrealized gains or losses resulting from
changes in fair value between measurement dates for trading securities are recorded as a
component of investment income (loss), net. Cash flows from all trading securities are
classified as cash flows from operating activities while cash flows from all other
investment securities are classified as cash flows from investing activities in our
statement of cash flows.

Restricted
publicly traded investments and investments in privately held companies are stated at
cost, adjusted for any known decrease in value (see

Note 6

).

Property and
Equipment

Depreciation
is recorded using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives and the
significant components of property and equipment are as follows (in millions):

- 40 -

COMCAST CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001 (Continued)

We
capitalize improvements that extend asset lives and expense other repairs and maintenance
charges as incurred. The cost and related accumulated depreciation applicable to assets
sold or retired are removed from the accounts and the gain or loss on disposition is
recognized as a component of depreciation expense.

We
capitalize the costs associated with the construction of cable transmission and
distribution facilities and new cable service installations. Costs include all direct
labor and materials, as well as certain indirect costs.

Intangible Assets

Cable
franchise rights represent the value attributed to agreements with local authorities that
allow access to homes in cable service areas acquired in connection with business
combinations. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, we amortized the value of these
rights over periods related to the term of the related franchise agreements. Subsequent
to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, we no longer amortize cable franchise rights because we
have determined that they have an indefinite life. We reassess this determination
periodically for each franchise based on the factors included in SFAS No. 142. Costs we
incur in negotiating and renewing cable franchise agreements are included in other
intangible assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the
franchise renewal period, generally 10 to 15 years.

Goodwill
is the excess of the acquisition cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the
identifiable net assets acquired. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, we amortized
goodwill over estimated useful lives ranging principally from 20 to 30 years. Subsequent
to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, we no longer amortize goodwill.

We
are required to test our goodwill and intangible assets that are determined to have an
indefinite life for impairment at least annually. The provisions of SFAS No. 142 required
the completion of an initial transitional impairment assessment, with any impairments
identified treated as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. We
completed this assessment in 2002 and determined that no cumulative effect resulted from
adopting this change in accounting principle. The provisions of SFAS No. 142 also require
the completion of an annual impairment test, with any impairments recognized in current
earnings.

Other
intangible assets consist principally of franchise related customer relationships
acquired in business combinations subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 141, “Business
Combinations,” on July 1, 2001, cable and satellite television distribution rights,
cable franchise renewal costs, contractual operating rights, computer software,
programming costs and rights, and non-competition agreements. We record these costs as
assets and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the term of the related agreements
or estimated useful life, which generally range from 2 to 20 years.

Certain
of our content subsidiaries have entered into multi-year affiliation agreements with
various cable and satellite television system operators for carriage of their respective
programming. We capitalize cable or satellite television distribution rights and amortize
them on a straight-line basis over the term of the related distribution agreements of 5
to 11 years. We classify the amortization of distribution fees paid by our content
subsidiaries pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) 01-09, “Accounting
for Consideration Given to a Customer (including a reseller of the Vendors Products)".
Under EITF 01-09, the amortization of such fees is classified as a reduction of revenue
unless the content subsidiary receives, or will receive, an identifiable benefit from the
cable or satellite system operator separate from the distribution fee, in which case we
recognize the fair value of the identified benefit as an operating expense in the period
in which it is received.

Certain
direct development costs associated with internal-use software are capitalized, including
external direct costs of material and services, and payroll costs for employees devoting
time to the software projects. Such costs are included within other assets and are
amortized over a period not to exceed five years beginning when the asset is
substantially ready for use. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage, as well
as maintenance and training costs, are expensed as incurred. Initial operating-system
software costs are capitalized and amortized over the life of the associated hardware.

Valuation of
Long-Lived and Indefinite-Lived Assets

We
periodically evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets, including property and
equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Our evaluations
include analyses based on the cash flows generated by the underlying assets,
profitability information, including estimated future operating results, trends or other
determinants of fair value. If the total of the expected future undiscounted cash flows
is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference
between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset. Unless presented separately,
the loss is included as a component of either depreciation expense or amortization
expense, as appropriate.

We evaluate the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets
annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
asset might be impaired. We perform the impairment assessment of our goodwill one level
below the business segment level, except for our cable business. In our cable business,
components one level below the segment level are not separate reporting units and also
have similar economic characteristics that allow them to be aggregated into one reporting
unit at the cable segment level. During 2002 and 2003, we performed the impairment
assessment of our cable franchise rights at the cable segment level based on our analysis
of the factors outlined in EITF 02-07, “Unit of Accounting for Testing Impairment of
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets.” Effective in the first quarter of 2004, we will
change the unit of accounting used for testing impairment to geographic regions and will
perform impairment testing on our cable franchise rights.  We do not anticipate
recording any impairment charge in connection with the impairment testing.

We
estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on multiples of
operating income before depreciation and amortization generated by the underlying assets,
discounted cash flow analyses, analyses of current market transactions and profitability
information, including estimated future operating results, trends or other determinants
of fair value. If the value of our cable franchise rights determined by these evaluations
is less than its carrying amount, an impairment charge would be recognized for the
difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets.

Foreign Currency
Translation

We
translate assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries, where the functional
currency is the local currency, into US dollars at the December 31 exchange rate and
record the related translation adjustments as a component of other comprehensive income.
We translate revenues and expenses using average exchange rates prevailing during the
year. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in other income.

Revenue Recognition

We
recognize video, high-speed Internet, and phone revenues as service is provided. We
manage credit risk by disconnecting services to customers who are delinquent. We
recognize advertising sales revenue at estimated realizable values when the advertising
is aired. Installation revenues obtained from the connection of subscribers to our
broadband communications network are less than related direct selling costs. Therefore,
such revenues are recognized as connections are completed. Revenues derived from other
sources are recognized when services are provided or events occur. Under the terms of our
franchise agreements, we are generally required to pay up to 5% of our gross revenues
derived from providing cable services to the local franchising authority. We normally
pass these fees through to our cable subscribers. We classify fees collected from cable
subscribers as a component of revenues pursuant to EITF 01-14, “Income Statement
Characterization of Reimbursements Received for ‘Out-of-Pocket’ Expenses
Incurred.”

Our
content businesses recognize affiliate fees from cable and satellite television system
operators as programming is provided. Advertising revenue is recognized in the period in
which commercial announcements or programs are telecast in accordance with the broadcast
calendar. In certain instances, our content businesses guarantee viewer ratings for their
programming. A liability for deferred revenue is provided for estimated shortfalls, which
are primarily settled by providing additional advertising time.

Programming Costs

Our
cable subsidiaries have received or may receive distribution fees from programming
networks for carriage of their programming. We reflect the deferred portion of these fees
within noncurrent liabilities and recognize the fees as a reduction of programming costs
(which are included in operating expenses) over the term of the programming contract.

Stock-Based
Compensation

We
account for stock-based compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (“APB”)
Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,”and related
interpretations, as permitted by SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” as amended. Compensation expense for stock options is measured as the
excess, if any, of the quoted market price of our stock at the date of the grant over the
amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. We record compensation expense for
restricted stock awards based on the quoted market price of our stock at the date of the
grant and the vesting period. We record compensation expense for stock appreciation
rights based on the changes in quoted market prices of our stock or other determinants of
fair value (see

Note 10

).

The
following table illustrates the effect on net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share
if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock-based
compensation. Upon further analysis during 2003, it was determined that the expected
option lives for options granted in prior years should have been 7 years
rather than the 8 years used previously. The amounts in the table reflect this revision
for all periods presented. Total stock-based compensation expense was determined under
the fair value method for all awards using the accelerated recognition method as
permitted under SFAS No. 123 (dollars in millions, except per share data):

The
weighted-average fair value at date of grant of a Class A common stock option granted
under our option plans during 2003 was $9.81 and during 2002 was previously presented as
$10.72, and was recalculated as $9.81 based on the revised estimate of expected option
life. The weighted-average fair value at date of grant of a Class A Special common stock
option granted under the option plans during 2002 and 2001 was previously presented as
$14.93 and $19.07, respectively, and was recalculated as $13.72 and $17.73, respectively,
based on the revised estimate of expected option life. The fair value of each option
granted during 2003, 2002 and 2001 was estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

the pro forma effect on net income or loss in future years since SFAS No. 123 does not

January 1, 1995 and also because additional awards in future years are anticipated.

Postretirement and
Postemployment Benefits

We
charge to operations the estimated costs of retiree benefits and benefits for former or
inactive employees, after employment but before retirement, during the years the
employees provide services (see

Note 9

).

Investment Income
(Loss), Net

Investment
income (loss), net includes interest income, dividend income, and gains and losses on the
sales and exchanges of marketable securities and long-term investments. We recognize
realized gains and losses using the specific identification method. Investment income
(loss), net also includes unrealized gains or losses on trading securities, fair value
adjustments on derivative instruments and hedged items, and impairment losses resulting
from adjustments to the net realizable value of certain of our investments (see

Note 6

).

Income Taxes

We
recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the
financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and expected
benefits of utilizing net operating loss carryforwards. The impact on deferred taxes of
changes in tax rates and laws, if any, applied to the years during which temporary
differences are expected to be settled, are reflected in the consolidated financial
statements in the period of enactment (see

Note 11

).

Derivative Financial
Instruments

We
use derivative financial instruments for a number of purposes. We manage our exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates by entering into interest rate exchange agreements (“Swaps”),
interest rate lock agreements (“Rate Locks”), interest rate cap agreements (“Caps”)
and interest rate collar agreements (“Collars”). We manage the cost of our
share repurchases through the sale of equity put option contracts (“Comcast Put
Options”). We manage our exposure to fluctuations in the value of certain of our
investments by entering into equity collar agreements (“Equity Collars”) and
equity put option agreements (“Equity Put Options”). We make investments in
businesses, to some degree, through the purchase of equity call option or call warrant
agreements (“Equity Warrants”). We have issued indexed debt instruments (“Exchangeable
Notes” and “ZONES”) and entered into prepaid forward sale agreements (“Prepaid
Forward Sales”) whose value, in part, is derived from the market value of certain
publicly traded common stock, and have also sold call options on certain of our
investments in equity securities in order to monetize a portion of those investments.
Equity hedges are used to manage exposure to changes in equity prices associated with
stock appreciation rights of certain of Broadband’s previously affiliated companies.
These equity hedges are recorded at fair value based on market quotes.

On
January 1, 2001, we adopted SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities.” SFAS No. 133 established accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments, including certain derivative

- 45 -

COMCAST CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001 (Continued)

instruments embedded in other
contracts and hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires that all derivative instruments,
whether designated in hedging relationships or not, be recorded on the balance sheet at
their fair values. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 133, we recognized as income a cumulative
effect of accounting change, net of related income taxes, of $385 million. The increase
in income consisted of a $400 million adjustment to record the debt component of indexed
debt at a discount from its value at maturity and $192 million principally related to the
reclassification of gains previously recognized as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) on our equity derivative instruments, net of related income
taxes of $207 million.

For
derivative instruments designated and effective as fair value hedges, such as our Equity
Collars, Equity Put Options and Fixed to Variable Swaps, changes in the fair value of the
derivative instrument are substantially offset in the consolidated statement of
operations by changes in the fair value of the hedged item. For derivative instruments
designated as cash flow hedges, such as our Variable to Fixed Swaps and Rate Locks, the
effective portion of any hedge is reported in other comprehensive income (loss) until it
is recognized in earnings during the same period in which the hedged item affects
earnings. The ineffective portion of all hedges is recognized in current earnings each
period. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as a
hedge are recorded each period in current earnings.

When
a fair value hedge is terminated, sold, exercised or has expired, the adjustment in the
carrying amount of the fair value hedged item is deferred and recognized into earnings
when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. When a hedged item is settled or sold,
the adjustment in the carrying amount of the hedged item is recognized in earnings. When
hedged variable rate debt is settled, the previously deferred effective portion of the
hedge is written off similar to debt extinguishment costs.

Equity
Warrants and Equity Collars are adjusted to estimated fair value on a current basis with
the result included in investment income (loss), net in our consolidated statement of
operations.

Derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts, such as our Exchangeable Notes, ZONES and
Prepaid Forward Sales, are separated into their host and derivative financial instrument
components. The derivative component is recorded at its estimated fair value in our
consolidated balance sheet with changes in estimated fair value recorded in investment
income (loss), net.

We
periodically examine those instruments we use to hedge exposure to interest rate and
equity price risks to ensure that the instruments are matched with underlying assets or
liabilities, reduce our risks relating to interest rates or equity prices and, through
market value and sensitivity analysis, maintain a high correlation to the risk inherent
in the hedged item. For those instruments that do not meet the above criteria, variations
in their fair value are reflected on a current basis in our consolidated statement of
operations.

We
do not hold or issue any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and are
not a party to leveraged instruments (see

Note 8

). We manage the credit risks associated
with our derivative financial instruments through the evaluation and monitoring of the
creditworthiness of the counterparties. Although we may be exposed to losses in the event
of nonperformance by the counterparties, we do not expect such losses, if any, to be
significant.

Sale of Stock by a
Subsidiary or Equity Method Investee

Changes
in our proportionate share of the underlying equity of a consolidated subsidiary or
equity method investee that result from the issuance of additional securities by such
subsidiary or investee are recognized as gains or losses in our consolidated statement of
operations unless gain realization is not assured in the circumstances. Gains for which
realization is not assured are credited directly to additional capital.

Securities Lending
Transactions

We
may enter into securities lending transactions pursuant to which we require the borrower
to provide cash collateral equal to the value of the loaned securities, as adjusted for
any changes in the value of the underlying

- 46 -

loaned securities. Loaned securities for which
we maintain effective control are included in investments in our consolidated balance
sheet.

Reclassifications

Certain
reclassifications have been made to the prior years’ consolidated financial
statements to conform to those classifications used in 2003.

RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

SFAS No. 143

The FASB issued SFAS No. 143,
“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” in
June 2001. SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset
retirement costs. SFAS No. 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2002. We adopted SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003. SFAS No. 143 requires that a
liability be recognized for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is
incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Certain of our
franchise agreements and leases contain provisions requiring us to restore facilities or
remove equipment in the event that the franchise or lease agreement is not renewed. We
expect to continually renew our franchise agreements and have concluded that the related
franchise right is an indefinite-lived intangible asset.  Accordingly, it is remote
that we would be required to incur significant restoration or removal costs. We
would record an estimated liability in the unlikely event a franchise agreement
containing such a provision is no longer expected to be renewed. We also expect to
renew many of our lease agreements related to the continued operation of our cable
business in the franchise areas. For our lease agreements, the liabilities related
to the removal provisions, if any, are either not estimable due to the wide range of
potential expiration dates or are not material.

SFAS No. 148

The
FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition
and Disclosure,” in December 2002. SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123 to provide
alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair
value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. SFAS No. 148 also
amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123 to require disclosure about the effects
on reported net income of an entity’s stock-based employee compensation in interim
financial statements. SFAS No. 148 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
31, 2002. We adopted SFAS No. 148 on January 1, 2003. We did not change to the fair
value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. Accordingly, the
adoption of SFAS No. 148 would only affect our financial condition or results of
operations if we elect to change to the fair value method specified in SFAS No. 123.

SFAS No. 149

In
April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities.” The Statement amends and clarifies accounting
for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 149 is effective for
contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, for hedging relationships
designated after June 30, 2003, and to certain preexisting contracts. We adopted SFAS No.
149 on July 1, 2003 on a prospective basis in accordance with the new
statement. The adoption of SFAS No. 149 did not have a material impact on our financial
condition or results of operations.

SFAS No. 150

In
May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.” This Statement
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial
instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 requires
that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability
or, in some circumstances, as an asset, with many such financial instruments having been
previously classified as equity. We adopted SFAS No. 150 on July 1, 2003. In connection
with the adoption of SFAS No. 150, we reclassified our subsidiary preferred shares
totaling

approximately $1.6 billion previously included in minority interest to other
noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.

The
FASB is addressing certain implementation issues associated with the application of SFAS
No. 150. In October 2003, the FASB decided to defer certain provisions of SFAS No. 150
related to mandatorily redeemable financial instruments representing non-controlling
interests in subsidiaries included in consolidated financial statements. We will monitor
the actions of the FASB and assess the impact, if any, that these actions may have on our
financial statements.

FIN 45

In
November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness
of Others” (“FIN 45”). FIN 45 expands on the accounting guidance of SFAS
No.‘s 5, 57, and 107 and supercedes FIN 34. FIN 45 clarifies that a guarantor is
required to disclose in its interim and annual financial statements its obligations under
certain guarantees that it has issued, including the nature and terms of the guarantee,
the maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantee, the carrying amount,
if any, for the guarantor’s obligations under the guarantee, and the nature and
extent of any recourse provisions or available collateral that would enable the guarantor
to recover the amounts paid under the guarantee. FIN 45 also clarifies that, for certain
guarantees, a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a
liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. FIN
45 does not prescribe a specific approach for subsequently measuring the guarantor’s
recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee. The initial recognition and
initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 apply on a prospective basis to certain
guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements in FIN
45 are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after
December 15, 2002. We adopted the disclosure provisions of FIN 45 in the fourth quarter
of 2002 and adopted the initial recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 45 on
January 1, 2003, as required by the Interpretation (see

Note 13

). The impact of the
adoption of FIN 45 will depend on the nature and terms of guarantees into which we enter
or modify in the future.

FIN 46/FIN 46R

In
January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities” (“FIN 46”). We adopted the provisions of FIN 46
effective January 1, 2002. Since our initial application of FIN 46, the FASB addressed
various implementation issues regarding the application of FIN 46 to entities outside its
originally interpreted scope, focusing on SPEs. In December 2003, the FASB revised FIN 46
(“FIN 46R”), which delayed the required implementation date for entities that
are not SPEs. We have elected to defer the adoption of FIN 46R until March 31, 2004 for
our non-SPE entities, such as our equity method investments in operating companies. We
are analyzing the effect of FIN 46R on the accounting for our equity method investments
and do not believe it will have a material impact on our financial condition or results
of operations.

EARNINGS
PER SHARE

Earnings
(loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for common stockholders
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period on a basic
and diluted basis. Weighted average shares outstanding for 2002 include 158.8 million of
the 1.348 billion of our Class A common stock we issued in connection with the Broadband
acquisition on November 18, 2002.

Our
potentially dilutive securities include potential common shares related to our Zero
Coupon Convertible Debentures due 2020 (the “Zero Coupon Debentures” — see

Note 8

), stock options, restricted stock, Series B convertible preferred stock, and
Comcast Put Options. Diluted earnings for common stockholders per common share (“Diluted
EPS”) considers the impact of potentially dilutive securities except in periods in
which there is a loss as the inclusion of the potential common shares would have an
antidilutive effect. Diluted EPS excludes the impact of potential common shares related
to our Zero Coupon Debentures in periods in which the weighted average closing sale price
of our Class A Special common stock during the period is not greater than 110% of the
accreted

price. Diluted EPS excludes the impact of potential common shares related to our stock
options in periods in which the option exercise price is greater than the average market
price of our common stock for the period. Diluted EPS excludes the impact of potential
common shares related to Comcast Put Options in periods in which the Comcast Put Options’ exercise
price was less than the average market price of our Class A Special common stock during
the period. Diluted EPS excludes the impact of potential common shares related to our
Class A Special common stock held in treasury because it is our intent to settle the
related Comcast exchangeable notes using cash (see

Note 8

).

Diluted
EPS for 2003 and 2002 excludes approximately 145.5 million and 90.8 million potential
common shares, respectively, related to our stock option plans, restricted stock plan and
Zero Coupon Debentures because the assumed issuance of such potential common shares is
antidilutive in periods in which there is a loss from continuing operations.

Diluted
EPS for 2001 excludes approximately 25.9 million potential common shares related to our
Zero Coupon Debentures, our stock option plans and our Put Options.

The
following table reconciles the numerator and denominator of the computations of Diluted
EPS for common stockholders from continuing operations before cumulative effect of

ACQUISITIONS
AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT EVENTS

Acquisition of
Broadband

On
November 18, 2002, we completed the acquisition of Broadband. The results of the
Broadband operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since
that date. The acquisition created the largest cable operator in the United States by
combining Broadband’s and our cable networks.

The
consideration to complete the acquisition of Broadband was $50.660 billion, consisting of
$25.495 billion of our common stock and options, $24.740 billion of assumed debt, and
$425 million of transaction costs directly related to the acquisition. We issued
approximately 1.348 billion shares of our common stock (excluding shares of Class A
common stock issued and classified as treasury stock) consisting of 1.233 billion shares
of our Class A common stock to Broadband shareholders in exchange for all of AT&T’s
interests in Broadband, and the issuance of

- 49 -

SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001 (Continued)

approximately 100.6 million shares and 14.4
million shares of our Class A and Class A Special common stock, respectively, to
Microsoft in exchange for Broadband shares that Microsoft received immediately prior to
the completion of the Broadband acquisition for settlement of its $5 billion aggregate
principal amount in quarterly income preferred securities. We also issued 61.1 million
options in exchange for outstanding Broadband options. The shares issued for Broadband
were valued based on a price per share of $18.80 that reflects the weighted average
market price of Comcast Holdings common stock during the period beginning two days before
and ending two days after August 12, 2002. The acquisition was structured as a tax-free
transaction to us, to Comcast Holdings and to AT&T. The identification of Comcast
Holdings as the acquiring entity was made after careful consideration of all facts and
circumstances, including those outlined in SFAS No. 141 related to voting rights, the
existence of a large minority voting interest, governance arrangements and composition of
senior management.

Under
the terms of the original merger agreement dated December 19, 2001, we were to assume
public debt of Broadband’s subsidiaries and fund Broadband’s intercompany
payable due to AT&T. Subsequent to the original merger agreement, economic and
business factors changed resulting in a modification of the consideration to be
exchanged. On August 12, 2002, in connection with the filing of a proposed exchange offer
by AT&T, the form of consideration to be exchanged was modified to provide for the
assumption by Broadband of a portion of AT&T’s public debt securities, thereby
increasing the amount of debt assumed by us by $3.5 billion and reducing the amount of
intercompany indebtedness paid at closing. This modification represented a substantive
change in the non-equity, or “other” consideration, being paid, resulting in a
new measurement date for determining the value of the common stock issued in the
acquisition. Accordingly, the fair value of the shares issued for Broadband was based on
the August 12, 2002 measurement date.

Purchase
Price Allocation.

The application of purchase accounting under SFAS No. 141 requires
that the total purchase price be allocated to the fair value of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the acquisition date. The allocation
process requires an analysis of acquired contracts, franchise related customer
relationships, employee benefit plans, contractual commitments and legal contingencies to
identify and record the fair value of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In
valuing acquired assets and liabilities, fair value estimates are based on, but are not
limited to: future expected cash flows; market rate assumptions for contractual
obligations; actuarial assumptions for benefit plans; settlement plans for litigation and
contingencies; and appropriate discount rates. During 2003, we finalized the purchase
price allocation except for certain of the litigation contingencies relating to our share
of AT&T’s potential liability associated with the At Home Corporation litigation
where we are waiting for additional information that we have arranged with AT&T to
obtain. We expect to obtain this information during 2004 (see

Note 13

).

As
of the acquisition date, we initiated certain integration activities based on a
preliminary plan to terminate employees and exit certain contractual obligations. Under
the guidance in EITF 95-3 “Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase
Business Combination,” the plan must be finalized within one year of the acquisition
date and must identify all significant actions to be taken to complete the plan.
Therefore, costs related to terminating employees and exiting contractual obligations of
the acquired entity are included in the purchase price allocation. Changes to these
estimated termination or exit costs are reflected as adjustments to the purchase price
allocation to the extent they occur within one year of the acquisition date or if there
are reductions in the amount of estimated termination or exit costs accrued. Otherwise,
changes will affect results of operations.

The
following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
and the related deferred income taxes as of the acquisition date and reflects adjustments
to the purchase price allocation during 2003.

In
the aggregate, the intangible assets that are subject to amortization have a weighted
average useful life of 4 years. Franchise related customer relationships have a weighted
average useful life of 4 years. The $9.178 billion of goodwill, none of which was
deductible for income tax purposes, was assigned to our cable segment.

Liabilities
associated with exit activities originally recorded in the purchase price allocation
consist of accrued employee termination and related costs of $602 million and $929
million associated with either the cost of terminating contracts or the present value of
remaining amounts payable under non-cancelable contracts. Amounts paid, adjustments made
against these accruals and interest accretion during 2003 were as follows (in millions):

and White Sox professional sports teams, formed Comcast SportsNet Chicago. This new
24-hour regional sports network will be available to approximately 1.5 million of our
Chicago-area subscribers upon its launch in October 2004. We acquired our controlling
interest in this network for approximately $87 million in cash. The preliminary purchase

price allocation resulted in the recording of $87 million of contract-related intangibles
to be amortized over a period of 15 years.

In
December 2003, we acquired the approximate 8.6% interest in TGC previously held by the
Tribune Company for $100 million in cash. This amount has been allocated to cable and
satellite television distribution rights and goodwill pending completion of a valuation.
As a result, we now own 99.9% of TGC.

Bresnan Transaction

On
March 20, 2003, we completed the previously announced transaction with Bresnan Broadband
Holdings, LLC and Bresnan Communications, LLC (together, “Bresnan”) pursuant to
which we transferred cable systems serving approximately 314,000 subscribers in Montana,
Wyoming, Colorado and Utah to Bresnan that we had acquired in connection with the
Broadband acquisition. We received $525 million in cash, plus preferred and common equity
interests in Bresnan in exchange for these cable systems. The assets of $613 million
(which consist primarily of cable franchise rights, other intangible assets and property
and equipment) were reported as current assets held for sale in accordance with SFAS No.
144 in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2002. The transfer of these
cable systems was accounted for at fair value with no gain or loss recognized. The
results of operations for these cable systems for the first quarter of 2003 were not
significant and were included in equity in net losses of affiliates in our consolidated
statement of operations.

TWE Restructuring

On
March 31, 2003, we completed the restructuring of our investment in Time Warner
Entertainment Company L.P. (“TWE”). As a result of the restructuring, Time
Warner Inc. (“Time Warner”) assumed complete control over TWE’s content
assets, including Home Box Office, Warner Bros., and stakes in The WB Network, Comedy
Central and Court TV. All of Time Warner’s interests in cable, including those held
through TWE, are now held through or for the benefit of a new subsidiary of Time Warner
called Time Warner Cable Inc. (“TWC”). In exchange for our 27.6% interest in
TWE, we received common-equivalent preferred stock of Time Warner, which will be
converted into $1.5 billion of Time Warner common stock valued upon completion of an
effective registration statement filing with the SEC, and we received a 21% economic
stake in the business of TWC. In addition, we received $2.1 billion in cash that was used
immediately to repay amounts outstanding under certain of our credit facilities (see
Notes 6 and 8). The TWE restructuring was accounted for as a fair value exchange with no
gain or loss recognized. Under the restructuring agreement, we have registration rights
that should facilitate the disposal or monetization of our shares in TWC and in Time
Warner. On December 29, 2003, demand registration rights were exercised to start the
registration process for the sale of up to 17.9% of TWC.

As
part of the process of obtaining approval of the Broadband acquisition from the Federal
Communications Commission (“FCC”), at the closing of the Broadband acquisition,
we placed our entire interest in TWE in trust for orderly disposition. Any non-cash
consideration received in respect of such interest as a result of the TWE restructuring,
including the Time Warner and TWC stock, will remain in trust until disposed of or FCC
approval is obtained to remove such interests from the trust.

Under
the trust, the trustee has exclusive authority to exercise any management or governance
rights associated with the securities in trust. The trustee also has the obligation,
subject to our rights as described in the last sentence of this paragraph, to exercise
available registration rights to effect the sale of such interests in a manner intended
to maximize the value received consistent with the goal of disposing such securities in
their entirety by November 2007. Following this time, if any securities remain in trust,
the trustee will be obligated to dispose of the remaining interests as quickly as
possible, and in any event by May 2008. The trustee is also obligated, through November
2007, to effect certain specified types of sale or monetization transactions with respect
to the securities as may be proposed by us from time to time.

Sale of QVC

On
September 17, 2003, we completed the sale to Liberty Media Corporation (“Liberty”)
of all shares of QVC common stock held by a number of our direct wholly-owned
subsidiaries for an aggregate value of approximately $7.7 billion, consisting of $4
billion principal amount of Liberty’s Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2006 (the “Liberty
Notes”), $1.35 billion in cash and approximately 218 million shares of Liberty
Series A common stock. The shares had a fair value on the closing date of $10.73 per
share. As a condition of closing, certain equity awards were required to be settled. The
cost of settling the awards was included in costs of the transaction. The consideration
received, net of transaction costs, over our carrying value of the net assets of QVC
resulted in a gain of approximately $3.290 billion, net of approximately $2.865 billion
of related income taxes.

Acquisitions and Exchanges

In 2001, we acquired the regional sports programming
network Home Team Sports (“HTS”) from Viacom, Inc. (“Viacom”) and
Affiliated Regional Communications, Ltd. (“ARC”), various cable systems serving
an aggregate of 697,000 subscribers from AT&T, and additional interests in
programming networks TGC and OLN from Fox Entertainment Group, Inc. (“Fox
Entertainment”). Upon closing of the OLN acquisition, we exchanged our 14.5%
interest in the Speedvision Network (“SVN”), together with a previously made
loan, for Fox Entertainment’s interest in OLN and recorded to other income a pre-tax
gain of $107 million, representing the difference between the estimated fair value of our
interest in SVN as of the closing date of the transaction and our cost basis in SVN. In
2001, we also completed our cable systems exchange with Adelphia Communications
Corporation (“Adelphia”). We recorded to other income a pre-tax gain of $1.199
billion, representing the difference between the estimated fair value of $1.799 billion
as of the closing date of the transaction and our cost basis in the systems exchanged.

The
acquisitions we completed during 2001 were accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting. As such, our results include the operating results of the acquired businesses
from the dates of acquisition. A summary of our acquisitions and cable systems exchange
for 2001 is as follows (dollars in millions):

2001 were $27 million, ($48) million and $10 million, respectively.

Our

with a
single bank counterparty that limit our exposure to and benefits from price fluctuations
in the Microsoft common stock and Vodafone ADRs. The Microsoft Collars and Vodafone
Collars are recorded in investments at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses being
recorded to investment income (loss), net. These unrealized gains or losses are
substantially offset by the changes in the fair value of shares of Microsoft common stock
and Vodafone ADRs.

The
Liberty Notes and shares of Liberty common stock received in the sale of QVC have been
registered with the SEC pursuant to the sale agreement. During 2003, we sold all $4.0
billion principal amount of the Liberty Notes for net proceeds of approximately $4.0
billion. In December 2003, we entered into a ten year prepaid forward sale of 100 million
shares of Liberty common stock and we received $894 million in cash. At maturity, the
counterparty is entitled to receive between 71 million and 100 million shares of Liberty
common stock, or an equivalent amount of cash at our option, based upon the market value
of Liberty common stock at the time. The shares of Liberty common stock are classified as
trading securities.

In
August 2001, we entered into a ten year prepaid forward sale of 4.0 million shares of
Sprint PCS common stock and we received $78 million in cash. At maturity, the
counterparty is entitled to receive between 2.5 million and 4.0 million shares of Sprint
PCS common stock, or an equivalent amount of cash at our option, based upon the market
value of Sprint PCS common stock at that time.

We
separated both of the prepaid forward sales into their liability and derivative
components and recorded both components of the prepaid forward sales obligations to other
long-term liabilities. We record the change in the fair value of the derivative component
and the accretion of the liability component to investment income (loss), net.

We
reclassified our investment in Sprint PCS from an available for sale security to a
trading security in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 133 in 2001. In connection
with this reclassification, we recorded to investment income (loss), net the accumulated
unrealized gain of $1.092 billion on our investment in Sprint PCS, which was previously
recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Equity Method

Our
recorded investments exceed our proportionate interests in the book value of the investees’ net
assets by $1.696 billion and $1.623 billion as of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively (principally related to our 50% owned investments in Texas Cable Partners,
Kansas City Cable Partners and Insight Midwest). A portion of this basis difference has
been attributed to franchise related customer relationships of the investees. This
difference is amortized to equity in net income or loss of affiliates over a period of
four years. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142, we do not amortize the portion
of the basis difference attributable to goodwill but will continue to test such excess
for impairment in accordance with APB Opinion 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting
for Investments in Common Stock.”

Equity

GSI Commerce,  Inc. was an equity method  investment  of QVC, and such amounts are
included  within  discontinued      operations for all periods through QVC's sale date
(see

Note 5

).

Cost Method

In
connection with the TWE Restructuring, we received a 21% economic stake in the business
of TWC. This investment is accounted for under the cost method because we do not have the
ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of
TWC (see

Note 5

).

We
hold two series of preferred stock of AirTouch Communications, Inc., a subsidiary of
Vodafone, that are recorded at $1.409 billion and $1.394 billion as of December 31, 2003
and 2002, respectively. The dividend and redemption activity of the AirTouch preferred
stock is tied to the dividend and redemption payments associated with substantially all
of the preferred shares issued by one of our subsidiaries. The subsidiary has outstanding
three series of preferred stock with an aggregate redemption value of $1.750 billion.
Substantially all of the preferred shares are redeemable in April 2020 at a redemption
value of $1.650 billion with one of the series bearing a 9.08% dividend rate. The
subsidiary preferred shares are recorded at $1.520 billion and $1.511 billion,
respectively, and such amounts are included in other noncurrent liabilities as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002.

In
connection with the Broadband acquisition, we acquired an indirect interest in CC VIII,
LLC, a cable joint venture with Charter Communications, Inc. In April 2002, AT&T
exercised its rights to cause Paul G. Allen, Charter’s Chairman, or his designee to
purchase this indirect interest. In June 2003, Paul Allen purchased our interest in CC
VIII for $728 million in cash. We accounted for the sale of our interest in CC VIII at
fair value with no gain or loss recognized. We used the proceeds from the sale to repay a
portion of the amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities (see

Note 8

).

GOODWILL
AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

The
changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by business segment (see

Note

) for the periods presented are as follows (in millions):

During
2003, we adjusted our purchase price allocation of the Broadband acquisition. The
decrease to goodwill primarily relates to the changes in values assigned to property and
equipment, franchise rights and franchise-related customer relationship intangible assets
as a result of obtaining updated valuation reports. Additionally, a portion of this
change relates to the reduction in our estimated liabilities associated with employee
termination costs, estimated contractual obligations assumed in the acquisition and the
impact of the adjustments on deferred taxes.

During
2003, we acquired an additional interest in TGC (see

Note 5

). A portion of the purchase
price was allocated to goodwill.

The Cross-Guarantee
Structure

To
simplify our capital structure, we and a number of our wholly-owned subsidiaries that
hold substantially all of our cable communications assets have unconditionally guaranteed
each other’s debt securities and indebtedness for borrowed money, including amounts
outstanding under the new credit facilities. As of December 31, 2003, $20.866
billion of our debt was included in the cross-guarantee structure.

Comcast
Holdings is not a guarantor and none of its debt is guaranteed under the cross-guarantee
structure. As of December 31, 2003, $1.024 billion of our debt was outstanding at
Comcast Holdings.

Debt Borrowings,
Repayments and Refinancings

During
2003, we borrowed $9.398 billion and repaid $16.465 billion of our debt. We reduced our
total debt outstanding by $7.913 billion primarily as a result of our net debt repayments
and the settlements of portions of our Exchangeable Notes upon maturity of the
instruments (see

Notes Exchangeable into Common Stock

below).

We
used the proceeds from these borrowings and substantially all of the proceeds received
from the following transactions, which are more fully described in Notes

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001 (Continued)

In
January 2004, we entered into a new $4.5 billion, five-year revolving bank credit
facility. Interest rates on this facility vary based on an underlying base rate (“Base
Rate”), chosen at our option, plus a borrowing margin. The Base Rate is either LIBOR
or the greater of the prime rate or the Federal Funds rate plus 0.5%. The borrowing
margin is based on our senior unsecured debt ratings. The interest rate for borrowings
under this revolver is LIBOR plus 0.625% based on our current credit ratings. This
revolver replaces three previously existing revolvers that bore interest at LIBOR plus
0.875% and aggregated $6.0 billion which were terminated simultaneously with the
effectiveness of the new facility (see

Lines and Letters of Credit

below).

Notes Exchangeable
into Common Stock

Our
Exchangeable Notes are mandatorily redeemable at our option into shares of Cablevision
Class A common stock or its cash equivalent, Microsoft common stock or its cash
equivalent, (i) Vodafone ADRs, (ii) the cash equivalent, or (iii) a combination of cash
and Vodafone ADRs, and Comcast Class A Special common stock or its cash equivalent. The
maturity value of the Exchangeable Notes varies based upon the fair market value of the
security to which it is indexed. Our Exchangeable Notes are collateralized by our
investments in Cablevision, Microsoft and Vodafone, respectively, and the Comcast Class A
Special common stock held in treasury (see

Note 6

).

During
2003, we settled an aggregate of $1.851 billion of our obligations relating to our
Exchangeable Notes. We settled an aggregate of $1.213 billion of our obligations relating
to Microsoft and Vodafone exchangeable notes by delivering the underlying shares of
common stock to the counterparty upon maturity of the instruments, and the equity collar
agreements related to the underlying shares expired. We also settled an aggregate of $638
million of our obligations relating to Comcast exchangeable notes by paying $498 million
in cash and by exercising our options to put the underlying equity collar agreements,
which had a value of $140 million, to the counterparty. The Microsoft and Vodafone
transactions, and the put option exercises in the Comcast transactions, represented
non-cash investing and financing activities and had no effect on our statement of cash
flows due to their non-cash nature. As of December 31, 2003, the securities we hold
collateralizing the Exchangeable Notes were sufficient to satisfy the debt obligations
associated with the outstanding Exchangeable Notes (see

Notes 6

and 12

).

ZONES

At
maturity, holders of our 2.0% Exchangeable Subordinated Debentures due 2029 (the “ZONES”)
are entitled to receive in cash an amount equal to the higher of the principal amount of
the ZONES or the market value of Sprint PCS common stock. Prior to maturity, each ZONES
is exchangeable at the holders’ option for an amount of cash equal to 95% of the
market value of Sprint PCS Stock. As of December 31, 2003, the number of Sprint PCS
shares we held exceeded the number of ZONES outstanding.

We
separated the accounting for the Exchangeable Notes and the ZONES into derivative and
debt components. We record the change in the fair value of the derivative component of
the Exchangeable Notes and the ZONES (see

Note 6

) and the change in the carrying value of
the debt component of the Exchangeable Notes and the ZONES as follows (in millions):

Interest Rates

Excluding
the derivative component of the Exchangeable Notes and the ZONES whose changes in fair
value are recorded to investment income (loss), net, our effective weighted average
interest rate on our total debt outstanding was 7.08% and 6.00% as of December 31, 2003
and 2002, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on our short-term debt was
2.53% as of December 31, 2002.

Interest Rate Risk
Management

We
are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates. To manage the
volatility relating to these exposures, our policy is to maintain a mix of fixed and
variable rate debt and to enter into various interest rate derivative transactions as
described below.

Using
Swaps, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and
variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal
amount. Rate Locks are used to hedge the risk that the cash flows related to the interest
payments on an anticipated issuance or assumption of fixed rate debt may be adversely
affected by interest rate fluctuations. Caps are used to lock in a maximum interest rate
should variable rates rise, but enable us otherwise to pay lower market rates. Collars
limit our exposure to and benefits from interest rate fluctuations on variable rate debt
to within a certain range of rates.

All
derivative transactions must comply with a board-approved derivatives policy. In addition
to prohibiting the use of derivatives for trading purposes or that increase risk, this
policy requires quarterly monitoring of the portfolio, including portfolio valuation,
measuring counterparty exposure and performing sensitivity analyses.

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001 (Continued)

The
notional amounts of interest rate instruments, as presented in the above table, are used
to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the amount of exposure to
credit loss. The estimated fair value approximates the proceeds (costs) to settle the
outstanding contracts. While Swaps, Rate Locks, Caps and Collars represent an integral
part of our interest rate risk management program, their effect on interest expense for
the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was not significant.

In
2002, we entered into Rate Locks to hedge the risk that the cash flows related to the
interest payments on an anticipated issuance or assumption of certain fixed rate debt in
connection with the Broadband acquisition may be adversely affected by interest rate
fluctuations. To the extent the Rate Locks are effective in offsetting the variability of
the hedged cash flows, changes in the fair value of the Rate Locks are not included in
earnings but are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss). Upon the assumption of certain fixed rate debt in connection with the Broadband
acquisition, the value of the Rate Locks is being recognized as an adjustment to interest
expense, similar to a deferred financing cost, over 15 years, which is the same period in which the related
interest costs on the debt are recognized in earnings. The unrealized pre-tax losses on
cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 of $213 million and $228 million,
respectively, have been reported in our balance sheet as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss), net of related deferred income taxes of $75 million and $80
million, respectively.

Estimated Fair Value

Our
debt had estimated fair values of $30.218 billion and $36.826 billion as of December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively. The estimated fair value of our publicly traded debt is
based on quoted market prices for that debt. Interest rates that are currently available
to us for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to
estimate fair value for debt issues for which quoted market prices are not available.

Debt Covenants

Certain
of our and our subsidiaries’ loan agreements require that we maintain financial
ratios based on debt, interest and operating income before depreciation and amortization,
as defined in the agreements. In addition, certain of our subsidiary loan agreements
contain restrictions on dividend payments and advances of funds to us. We were in
compliance with all financial covenants for all periods presented.

As
of December 31, 2003, $50 million of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments is restricted under contractual or other arrangements. Restricted net assets
of our subsidiaries were approximately $368 million as of December 31, 2003.

Lines and Letters of
Credit

As
of December 31, 2003, certain of our subsidiaries had unused lines of credit of
$5.876 billion under their respective credit facilities.

On
January 8, 2004, we refinanced three of our existing revolving credit facilities with a
new $4.5 billion, five-year revolving bank credit facility due January 2009. As of
January 8, 2004, amounts available under our lines of credit totaled $4.381 billion.

As
of December 31, 2003, we and certain of our subsidiaries had unused irrevocable standby
letters of credit totaling $419 million to cover potential fundings under various
agreements.

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Preferred Stock

We
are authorized to issue, in one or more series, up to a maximum of 20 million shares of
preferred stock. We can issue the shares with such designations, preferences,
qualifications, privileges, limitations, restrictions, options, conversion rights and
other special or related rights as our board of directors shall from time to time fix by
resolution.

Our
Series B Preferred Stock had a 5.25% pay-in-kind annual dividend. Dividends were paid
quarterly through the issuance of additional shares of our Series B Preferred Stock. In
March 2001, we issued approximately 4.2 million shares of our Class A Special common
stock to the holder in connection with the holder’s election to convert the
remaining $60 million at redemption value of Series B Preferred Stock.

Common Stock

Our
Class A Special common stock is generally nonvoting. Holders of our Class A common stock
in the aggregate hold 66 2/3% of the aggregate voting power of our capital stock. The
number of votes that each share of our Class A common stock will have at any given time
will depend on the number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock then
outstanding. Each share of our Class B common stock is entitled to fifteen votes and all
shares of our Class B common stock in the aggregate have 33 1/3% of the voting power of
all of our common stock. The 33 1/3% aggregate voting power of our Class B common stock
will not be diluted by additional issuances of any other class of our common stock. Our
Class B common stock is convertible, share for share, into Class A or Class A Special
common stock, subject to certain restrictions.

Treasury Stock

Certain
Broadband subsidiaries held AT&T preferred stock convertible into AT&T common
stock. Prior to the closing of the Broadband acquisition, these subsidiaries converted
the AT&T preferred stock into AT&T common stock. Upon closing of the Broadband
acquisition, the shares of Broadband common stock were exchanged for approximately 243.6
million shares of our Class A common stock. We classified these shares, which are held by
certain of our subsidiaries, as treasury stock within stockholders’ equity. The
shares were valued at $6.391 billion based on the closing share price of our Class A
common stock as of the closing date of the Broadband acquisition and will continue to be
carried at this amount. The shares are deemed issued but not outstanding and are not
included in the computation of Diluted EPS.

Prior
to the Broadband acquisition, Broadband held approximately 47.3 million shares of our
Class A Special common stock that collateralize the related Comcast exchangeable notes
(see

Note 8

). Upon closing of the Broadband acquisition, we classified these shares,
which are held by our subsidiary, as treasury stock within stockholders’ equity. The
shares were valued based on the closing share price of our Class A Special common stock
as of the closing date of the Broadband acquisition and will continue to be carried at
this amount. The shares are deemed issued but not outstanding and are not included in the
computation of Diluted EPS because it is our intent to settle the related Comcast
exchangeable notes using cash.

Board-Authorized
Repurchase Programs

In
December 2003, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of
our outstanding common equity securities. We expect such repurchases to occur from time
to time, in the open market or in private transactions, subject to market conditions.

As
part of a previous Board-authorized repurchase program, we sold Comcast Put Options on
shares of our Class A Special common stock that expired unexercised in 2001.

Option Plans.

We maintain stock option plans for certain employees, directors and
other persons under which fixed stock options are granted and the option price is
generally not less than the fair value of a share of the underlying stock at the date of
grant (collectively, the “Comcast Option Plans”). Under the Comcast Option
Plans, 204 million shares of our Class A and Class A Special common stock were reserved
for issuance upon the exercise of options, including those outstanding as of December 31,
2003. Option terms are generally ten years, with options generally becoming exercisable

The
following table summarizes information about the options outstanding under the Comcast
Option Plans as of December 31, 2003 (options in thousands):

Subsidiary
Option Plans

. Certain of our subsidiaries maintain combination stock option/stock
appreciation rights (“SAR”) plans (collectively, the “Tandem Plans”)
for employees, officers, directors and other designated persons. Under the Tandem Plans,
the option price is generally not less than the fair value, as determined by an
independent appraisal, of a share of the underlying common stock at the date of grant. If
the eligible participant elects the SAR feature of the Tandem Plans, the participant
receives 75% of the excess of the fair value of a share of the underlying common stock
over the exercise price of the option to which it is attached at the exercise date. The
holders of a majority of the outstanding options have stated an intention not to exercise
the SAR feature of the Tandem Plans. Because the exercise of the option component is more
likely than the exercise of the SAR feature, compensation expense is measured based on
the stock option component. Under the Tandem Plans, option/SAR terms are ten years from
the date of grant, with options/SARs generally becoming exercisable over four to five
years from the date of grant.

Other Stock-Based
Compensation Plans

We
maintain a restricted stock plan under which management employees may be granted
restricted share awards in our Class A or Class A Special common stock (the “Restricted
Stock Plan”). The share awards vest annually, generally over a period not to exceed
five years from the date of the award, and do not have voting rights. At December 31,
2003, there were 312,000 shares of our Class A common stock and 573,000 shares of our
Class A Special common stock issuable in connection with restricted share awards under
the Restricted Stock Plan, of which 35,000 shares and 172,000 shares were issued in
January 2004, respectively.

We
also maintain a deferred stock option plan for certain employees, officers and directors
that provides the optionees with the opportunity to defer the receipt of shares of our
Class A or Class A Special common stock which would otherwise be deliverable upon
exercise by the optionees of their stock options. As of December 31, 2003, 6.1

Our
net deferred tax liability consists of the following components (in millions):

We
recorded $820 million and $837 million of deferred income tax liabilities in 2003 through
income tax benefit and gain on discontinued operations, respectively. We increased
deferred income tax liabilities by an additional $713 million in 2003, principally in
connection with adjustments made to the Broadband purchase price allocation. We recorded
an increase (decrease) of $3 million, ($152) million and ($149) million to deferred
income tax liabilities in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, in connection with
unrealized gains (losses) on marketable securities and cash flow hedges that are included
in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We recorded $207 million of deferred
income tax liabilities in 2001 in connection with the cumulative effect of accounting
change related to the adoption of SFAS No. 133 (see

Note 2

).

We
have recorded net deferred tax liabilities of $679 million and $1.105 billion, as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, that have been included in current
liabilities, related primarily to our current investments. We have net operating loss
carryforwards, primarily state, that expire in periods through 2023. The determination of
the state net operating loss carryforwards are dependent upon the subsidiaries’taxable
income or loss, apportionment percentages and other respective state laws, which can
change year-to-year and impact the amount of such carryforward.

COMMITMENTS
AND CONTINGENCIES

Commitments

Our
programming networks have entered into license agreements for programs and sporting
events that are available for telecast. In addition, we, through Comcast-Spectacor, have
employment agreements with both players and coaches of our professional sports teams.
Certain of these employment agreements, which provide for payments that are guaranteed
regardless of employee injury or termination, are covered by disability insurance if
certain conditions are met.

Certain
of our subsidiaries support debt compliance with respect to obligations of certain cable
television partnerships and investments in which we hold an ownership interest (see

Note

). The obligations expire between May 2008 and September 2010. Although there can be no
assurance, we believe that we will not be required to meet our obligations under such
commitments. The total notional amount of our commitments was $1.021 billion as of
December 31, 2003, at which time there were no quoted market prices for similar
agreements.

Contingencies

We
and the minority owner group in Comcast Spectacor each have the right to initiate an
“exit” process under which the fair market value of Comcast Spectacor would be
determined by appraisal. Following such determination, we would have the option to
acquire the interests in Comcast Spectacor owned by the minority owner group based on the
appraised fair market value. In the event we do not exercise this option, we and the
minority owner group would then be required to use our best efforts to sell Comcast
Spectacor. This exit process includes the minority owner group’s interest in CSN.

We
hold the majority of our interest in E! Entertainment through Comcast Entertainment
Holdings, LLC (“Entertainment Holdings”), which is owned 50.1% by us and 49.9%
by The Walt Disney Company (“Disney”). Under a limited liability company
agreement between us and Disney, we control E! Entertainment’s operations. As a
result of the Broadband acquisition and in certain other circumstances, under the
agreement Disney is entitled to trigger a potential exit process in which Entertainment
Holdings would have the right to purchase Disney’s entire interest in Entertainment
Holdings at its then fair market value (as determined by an appraisal process). If Disney
exercises this right within a specified time period, and Entertainment Holdings elects
not to purchase Disney’s interest, Disney then has the right to purchase, at
appraised fair market value, either our entire interest in Entertainment Holdings or all
of the shares of stock of E! Entertainment held by Entertainment Holdings. In the event
that Disney exercises its right and neither Disney’s nor our interest is purchased,
Entertainment Holdings will continue to be owned as it is today, as if the exit process
had not been triggered.

At
Home.

Litigation
has been filed against us as a result of our alleged conduct with respect to our
investment in and distribution relationship with At Home Corporation. At Home was a
provider of high-speed Internet services that filed for bankruptcy protection in
September 2001. Filed actions are: (i) class action lawsuits against us, Brian L. Roberts
(our President and Chief Executive Officer and a director), AT&T (the former
controlling shareholder of At Home and also a former distributor of the At Home service)
and other corporate and individual defendants in the Superior Court of San Mateo County,
California, alleging breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with transactions agreed to
in March 2000 among At Home, AT&T, Cox Communications, Inc. (Cox is also an investor
in At Home and a former distributor of the At Home service) and us; (ii) class action
lawsuits against Comcast Cable Communications, LLC, AT&T and others in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging securities law
violations and common law fraud in connection with disclosures made by At Home in 2001;

- 73 -

COMCAST CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001 (Continued)

(iii) a lawsuit brought in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware
in the name of At Home by certain At Home bondholders against us, Brian L. Roberts, Cox
and others, alleging breaches of fiduciary duty relating to the March 2000 transactions
and seeking recovery of alleged short-swing profits of at least $600 million pursuant to
Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 purported to have arisen in
connection with certain transactions relating to At Home stock effected pursuant to the
March 2000 agreements; and (iv) a lawsuit brought in the United States Bankruptcy Court
for the Northern District of California by certain At Home bondholders against Comcast
Cable Holdings, LLC and Comcast Cable Communications Holdings, Inc., as well as AT&T,
AT&T Credit Holdings, Inc. and AT&T Wireless Services, Inc., seeking to avoid and
recover certain alleged “preference” payments in excess of $89 million
allegedly made to the defendants prior to the At Home bankruptcy filing. The actions in
San Mateo County, California have been stayed by the United States Bankruptcy Court for
the Northern District of California, the court in which At Home filed for bankruptcy, as
violating the automatic bankruptcy stay. In the Southern District of New York actions,
the court ordered the actions consolidated into a single action. All of the defendants
served motions to dismiss on February 11, 2003. The court dismissed the common law claims
against us and Mr. Roberts, leaving only a claim against them for “control person” liability
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In a subsequent decision, the court limited
the remaining claim against us and Mr. Roberts to disclosures that are alleged to have
been made by At Home prior to August 28, 2000. The Delaware case has been transferred to
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and we have moved
to dismiss the Section 16(b) claims.

Under
the terms of the Broadband acquisition, we are generally contractually liable for 50% of
any liabilities of AT&T relating to At Home, including most liabilities resulting
from any pending or threatened litigation, with the exception, among other things, of
liabilities arising out of contracts between At Home and AT&T (or its affiliates) for
the benefit of the businesses retained by AT&T following the divestiture of
Broadband. In those situations where we are contractually liable for 50% of any
liabilities, AT&T will be liable for the other 50% of these liabilities. In addition
to the actions against AT&T described above, where we are also a defendant, there are
two additional actions brought by At Home’s bondholders’ liquidating trust
against AT&T, not naming us: (i) a lawsuit filed against AT&T and certain of its
senior officers in Santa Clara, California state court alleging various breaches of
fiduciary duties, misappropriation of trade secrets and other causes of action in
connection with the transactions in March 2000 described above, and prior and subsequent
alleged conduct on the part of the defendants, and (ii) an action filed against AT&T
in the District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that AT&T
infringes an At Home patent by using its broadband distribution and high-speed Internet
backbone networks and equipment. Both of these actions are in the discovery stage.

We
deny any wrongdoing in connection with the claims that have been made directly against
us, our subsidiaries and Brian L. Roberts, and intend to defend all of these claims
vigorously. In our opinion, the final disposition of these claims is not expected to have
a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, but could possibly be
material to our consolidated results of operations of any one period. Further, no
assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our consolidated
financial position.

We
are currently waiting to obtain additional information, and, therefore, are unable to
determine what impact, if any, the final resolution of our share of these AT&T At
Home potential liabilities would have on our consolidated financial position or results
of operations. No assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material.

AT&T.

We,
in connection with our acquisition of Broadband, are potentially responsible for a
portion of the liabilities arising from two purported securities class action lawsuits
brought against AT&T and others and consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United
States District Court for the District of New Jersey. These lawsuits assert claims under
Section 11, Section 12(a)(2) and Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
The first lawsuit, for which our portion of the

- 74 -

COMCAST CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001 (Continued)

exposure is up to 15%, alleges, among
other things, that AT&T made material misstatements and omissions in the Registration
Statement and Prospectus for the AT&T Wireless initial public offering. The second
lawsuit, for which our portion of the exposure is up to 50%, alleges, among other things,
that AT&T knowingly provided false projections relating to AT&T common stock. The
complaints seek damages in an unspecified amount, but because the trading activity during
the purported class periods was extensive the amounts ultimately demanded may be
significant. We and AT&T believe that AT&T has meritorious defenses and these
actions are being vigorously defended. The parties are currently engaged in discovery and
motions for summary judgment were filed in March 2004.

On
June 24, 1998, the first of a number of purported class action lawsuits was filed by
then-shareholders of Tele-Communications, Inc. (“TCI”) Series A TCI Group
Common Stock (“Common A”) against AT&T and the directors of TCI relating to
the acquisition of TCI by AT&T. A consolidated amended complaint combining the
various different actions was filed on February 10, 1999 in the Delaware Court of
Chancery. The consolidated amended complaint alleges that former members of the TCI board
of directors breached their fiduciary duties to Common A shareholders by agreeing to
transaction terms whereby holders of the Series B TCI Group Common Stock received a 10%
premium over what Common A shareholders received in connection with the transaction. The
complaint further alleges that AT&T aided and abetted the TCI directors’ breach.

In
connection with the TCI acquisition, which was completed in early 1999, AT&T agreed
under certain circumstances to indemnify TCI’s former directors for certain losses,
expenses, claims or liabilities, potentially including those incurred in connection with
this action. In connection with the Broadband acquisition, Broadband agreed to indemnify
AT&T for certain losses, expenses, claims or liabilities. Those losses and expenses
potentially include those incurred by AT&T in connection with this action, both as a
defendant and in connection with any obligation that AT&T may have to indemnify the
former TCI directors for liabilities incurred as a result of the claims against them in
this action.

On
September 8, 1999, AT&T moved to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a
cause of action against AT&T. On July 7, 2003, the Delaware Court of Chancery granted
AT&T’s motion to dismiss on the ground that the complaint failed to adequately
plead AT&T’s “knowing participation,” as required to state a claim for
aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty. The other claims made in the complaint
remain outstanding. Discovery in this matter is now closed.

In
our opinion, the final disposition of these claims is not expected to have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, but could possibly be material to
our consolidated results of operations of any one period. Further, no assurance can be
given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our consolidated financial
position.

Liberty
Digital.

On
January 8, 2003, Liberty Digital, Inc. filed a complaint in Colorado state court against
us and Comcast Cable Holdings, LLC. The complaint alleges that Comcast Cable Holdings
breached a 1997 “contribution agreement” between Liberty Digital and Comcast
Cable Holdings and that we tortiously interfered with that agreement. The complaint
alleges that this purported agreement obligates Comcast Cable Holdings to pay fees to
Liberty Digital totaling $18 million (increasing at CPI) per year through 2017. Liberty
Digital seeks, among other things, compensatory damages, specific performance of the
purported agreement, a declaration that the agreement is valid and enforceable going
forward, and an unspecified amount of exemplary damages from us based on the alleged
intentional interference claim. We and Comcast Cable Holdings filed our answer to the
complaint on March 5, 2003, in which we denied the essential allegations of the complaint
and asserted various affirmative defenses.

On
November 6, 2003, Liberty Digital was granted leave to file an amended complaint that
contained one minor revision to the original complaint. On December 16, 2003, we and
Comcast Cable Holdings filed our answer to the

amended complaint, in which we again
denied the essential allegations of the complaint and asserted various affirmative
defenses. Discovery in this matter is currently underway and a trial is scheduled to
commence on May 31, 2004.

In
our opinion, the final disposition of these claims is not expected to have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, but could possibly be material to
our consolidated results of operations of any one period. Further, no assurance can be
given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our consolidated financial
position.

Other.

We
are subject to other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of
our business. In our opinion, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such
actions is not expected to materially affect our financial position, results of
operations or liquidity.

Assets included in this caption consist primarily of our investments and

) and,
as of December 31, 2002, $3.689 billion of assets associated with discontinued

of assets associated with discontinued operations.

Non-US
revenues were not significant in any period. No single customer accounted for a
significant amount of our revenue in any period.

(3)

Operating
income (loss) before depreciation and amortization is defined as operating
income before depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, if any,
related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses from the sale of
assets, if any. As such, it eliminates the significant level of non-cash depreciation
and amortization expense that results from the capital intensive nature of
our businesses and intangible assets recognized in business combinations,
and is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities.
Our management and Board of Directors use this measure in evaluating our consolidated
operating performance and the operating performance of all of our operating
segments. This metric is used to allocate resources and capital to our
operating segments and is a significant component of our annual incentive
compensation programs. We believe that this measure is also useful to
investors as it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance
with other companies in our industries, although our measure may not be
directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. This
measure should not be considered as a substitute for operating income (loss),
net income (loss), net cash provided by operating activities or other
measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.

effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by

controls and procedures were adequate and designed to ensure that material information
relating to us and our consolidated subsidiaries would be made known to them by others
