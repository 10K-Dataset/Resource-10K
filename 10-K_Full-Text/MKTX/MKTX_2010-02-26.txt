PART I

Forward-Looking
    Statements

This report contains certain “forward-looking
    statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities
    Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be
    identified by words such as “expects,”
    “intends,” “anticipates,” “plans,”
    “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,”
    “will,” or words of similar meaning and include, but
    are not limited to, statements regarding the outlook for our
    future business and financial performance. Forward-looking
    statements are based on management’s current expectations
    and assumptions, which are subject to inherent uncertainties,
    risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to
    predict. It is routine for our internal projections and
    expectations to change as the year or each quarter in the year
    progresses, and therefore it should be clearly understood that
    the internal projections and beliefs upon which we base our
    expectations may change prior to the end of each quarter or the
    year. Although these expectations may change, we are under no
    obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements
    contained in this report. Our company policy is generally to
    provide our expectations only once per quarter, and not to
    update that information until the next quarter. Actual future
    events or results may differ, perhaps materially, from those
    contained in the projections or forward-looking statements.
    Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences
    include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report,
    particularly in Item 1A “Risk Factors.”

Item 1.

Business.

MarketAxess operates a leading electronic trading platform that
    allows investment industry professionals to efficiently trade
    corporate bonds and other types of fixed-income instruments. Our
    730 active institutional investor clients (firms that executed
    at least one trade in U.S. or European fixed-income
    securities through our electronic trading platform during
    2009) include investment advisers, mutual funds, insurance
    companies, public and private pension funds, bank portfolios,
    broker-dealers and hedge funds. Our 67 broker-dealer
    market-maker clients provide liquidity on the platform and
    include most of the leading broker-dealers in global
    fixed-income trading. Our
    DealerAxess

®

trading service allows dealers to trade fixed-income securities
    and credit default swaps with each other on our platform.
    Through our Corporate
    BondTicker

tm

service, we provide fixed-income market data, analytics and
    compliance tools that help our clients make trading decisions.
    In addition, we provide FIX (Financial Information eXchange)
    message management tools, connectivity solutions and ancillary
    technology services that facilitate the electronic communication
    of order information between trading counterparties. Our
    revenues are primarily generated from the trading of
    U.S. and European high-grade corporate bonds.

Our multi-dealer trading platform allows our institutional
    investor clients to simultaneously request competing, executable
    bids or offers from our broker-dealer clients and execute trades
    with the broker-dealer of their choice from among those that
    choose to respond. We offer our broker-dealer clients a solution
    that enables them to efficiently reach our institutional
    investor clients for the distribution and trading of bonds. In
    addition to U.S. high-grade corporate bonds, European
    high-grade corporate bonds and emerging markets bonds, including
    both investment-grade and non-investment grade debt, we also
    offer our clients the ability to trade crossover and high-yield
    bonds, agency bonds and credit default swaps (“CDS”).

The majority of our revenues are derived from monthly
    distribution fees and commissions for trades executed on our
    platform that are billed to our broker-dealer clients on a
    monthly basis. We also derive revenues from technology products
    and services, information and user access fees, investment
    income and other income. Our expenses consist of employee
    compensation and benefits, depreciation and amortization,
    technology and communication expenses, professional and
    consulting fees, occupancy, marketing and advertising and other
    general and administrative expenses.

Traditionally, bond trading has been a manual process, with
    product and price discovery conducted over the telephone between
    two or more parties. This traditional process has a number of
    shortcomings resulting primarily from the lack of a central
    trading facility for these securities, which creates difficulty
    matching buyers and sellers for particular issues. Many
    corporate bond trading participants use

e-mail

and
    other electronic means of communication for trading corporate
    bonds. While this has addressed some of the shortcomings
    associated with traditional corporate bond trading, we believe
    that the process is still hindered by limited liquidity, limited
    price



transparency, significant transaction costs, compliance and
    regulatory challenges, and difficulty in executing numerous
    trades at one time.

Through our disclosed multi-dealer Request For Quote
    (“RFQ”) trading functionality, our institutional
    investor clients can determine prices available for a security,
    a process called price discovery, as well as trade securities
    directly with our broker-dealer clients. The price discovery
    process includes the ability to view indicative prices from the
    broker-dealer clients’ inventory available on our platform,
    access to real-time pricing information and analytical tools
    (including

spread-to-Treasury

data, search capabilities and independent third-party credit
    research) available on our Corporate
    BondTicker

tm

service and the ability to request executable bids and offers
    simultaneously from up to 50 of our broker-dealer clients during
    the trade process. On average, institutional investor clients
    receive several bids or offers from broker-dealer clients in
    response to trade inquiries. However, some trade inquiries may
    not receive any bids or offers. Our services relating to trade
    execution include single and multiple-dealer inquiries; list
    trading, which is the ability to request bids and offers on
    multiple bonds at the same time; and swap trading, which is the
    ability to request an offer to purchase one bond and a bid to
    sell another bond, in a manner such that the two trades will be
    executed simultaneously, with payment based on the price
    differential of the bonds. Once a trade is completed on our
    platform, the broker-dealer client and institutional investor
    client may settle the trade with the assistance of our automated
    post-trade messaging, which facilitates the communication of
    trade acknowledgment and allocation information between our
    institutional investor and broker-dealer clients.

Typically, we are not a party to the trades that occur on our
    platform between institutional investor clients and
    broker-dealer clients; rather, we serve as an intermediary
    between broker-dealers and institutional investors, enabling
    them to meet, agree on a price and then transact with each
    other. However, we also execute certain bond transactions
    between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer
    clients on a riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty
    to both the buyer and the seller in matching

back-to-back

trades, which are then settled through a third-party clearing
    organization. These are primarily voice-assisted trades, a
    service that we introduced as an adjunct to RFQ trading during
    late 2008 in response to the adverse effect of the credit crisis
    on dealer liquidity in corporate bonds. MarketAxess Corporation,
    our U.S. subsidiary, acts as intermediary on a riskless
    principal basis in these bond transactions by serving as
    counterparty to the two clients involved.

Our broker-dealer clients accounted for approximately 97.2% of
    the underwriting of newly-issued U.S. high-grade corporate
    bonds and approximately 69.6% of the underwriting of newly
    issued European high-grade corporate bonds in 2009. We believe
    these broker-dealers also represent the principal source of
    secondary market liquidity in the other markets in which we
    operate. Secondary market liquidity refers to the ability of
    market participants to buy or sell a security quickly and in
    large volume subsequent to the original issuance of the
    security, without substantially affecting the price of the
    security. In addition to trading fixed-income securities by
    traditional means, including the telephone and

e-mail,

our
    broker-dealer clients use proprietary single-dealer systems and
    other trading platforms as well as our electronic trading
    platform. We believe that the traditional means of trading
    remain the manner in which the majority of bonds are traded
    between institutional investors and broker-dealers. Our volume
    in U.S. high-grade corporate bonds represented
    approximately 6.2% of the total U.S. high-grade corporate
    bond volume, excluding convertible bonds, for 2009 as reported
    by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
    (“FINRA”) Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine
    (“TRACE”), which includes inter-dealer and retail
    trading as well as trading between institutional investors and
    broker-dealers. We have not identified a reliable source of data
    relating to the size of most of the other markets we serve and
    therefore we are unable to accurately determine the total volume
    of secondary trading of these bonds or the portion of such
    trading conducted on our platform.

Industry
    Background

Fixed-income securities are issued by corporations, governments
    and other entities, and pay a pre-set absolute or relative rate
    of return. As of September 30, 2009 there were
    approximately $34.6 trillion of fixed-income securities
    outstanding in the U.S. market, including $6.9 trillion of
    U.S. corporate bonds.

The U.S. and European credit markets have been through a
    period of significant turmoil since the third quarter of 2007,
    especially in short-term funding and floating rate note
    instruments. A widespread retrenchment in the credit markets
    resulted in increased credit spreads and significantly higher
    credit spread volatility across a wide range of asset classes.
    Credit yield spreads in U.S. corporate bonds, as measured
    by the Credit Suisse Liquid



U.S. Corporate Index, increased from 1.0% over
    U.S. Treasuries in June 2007 to a peak of 5.4% in December
    2008. The credit markets demonstrated significant improvement
    throughout 2009, with net inflows to taxable bond funds and
    corporate and international bond exchange-traded funds, and an
    increase in the volume of new issues of high-grade corporate
    bonds compared to the second half of 2008. Credit yield spreads
    in U.S. corporate bonds declined to 1.2% over
    U.S. Treasuries as of December 31, 2009. The average
    daily trading volume of U.S. high-grade corporate bonds for
    the quarter ended December 31, 2009, as measured by TRACE,
    was $11.0 billion, compared to $8.0 billion in the
    quarter ended December 31, 2008.

U.S.
    High-Grade Corporate Bond Market

The total amount of U.S. corporate bonds outstanding has
    grown from $3.0 trillion as of December 31, 1999 to $6.9
    trillion as of September 30, 2009. The average daily
    trading volume of U.S. corporate bonds (investment grade
    and high yield), as measured by TRACE, has decreased from
    approximately $17.9 billion in 2002 (the first calendar
    year for which such data are available) to $16.5 billion in
    2009. We believe that this decline in average daily trading
    volumes is due to cyclical credit market conditions, including
    the recent turmoil in the credit markets.

The U.S. corporate bond market consists of three broad
    categories of securities: investment-grade debt (so-called
    “high-grade”), which typically refers to debt rated
    BBB- or better by Standard & Poor’s or Baa3 or
    better by Moody’s Investor Service; debt rated below
    investment-grade (so-called “high-yield”), which
    typically refers to debt rated lower than BBB- by
    Standard & Poor’s or Baa3 by Moody’s
    Investor Service; and debt convertible into equity (so-called
    “convertible debt”).

The U.S. high-grade corporate bond market, which represents
    the largest subset of the U.S. corporate bond market, has
    undergone significant change over the last decade, which has
    been driven by a number of factors, including:

•

Improved price transparency

— In 2002, FINRA
    adopted TRACE reporting, which requires FINRA members to report
    secondary market transactions in certain fixed-income securities
    to FINRA. The list of TRACE-eligible bonds includes 27,000
    unique securities, representing the majority of the daily
    trading volume of high-grade bonds.

•

Introduction of electronic trading platforms

— Electronic trading platforms act as central
    facilities to bring together buyers and sellers. The actions of
    participants on these platforms are facilitated by an electronic
    medium that improves some of the manual processes that might
    otherwise be required, such as searching for securities with
    specific characteristics, the coordination of multiple bilateral
    telephone calls or electronic communications, the sorting and
    analysis of competing bids or offers, and the entry of orders
    into the trading system after verbal or

e-mail

trade
    agreement. As a result, these platforms typically provide a
    lower-cost and more efficient means of enhanced distribution and
    trade execution than previously possible.

•

Introduction of credit derivatives

— Credit
    derivatives can provide increased flexibility and liquidity for
    investors and lenders to diversify their credit exposures. The
    notional amount of outstanding CDS transactions grew rapidly
    between 2002 and 2007. However, activity in the CDS market has
    since fallen substantially due to concern over the risks
    associated with these products, in particular the counterparty
    credit risks.

•

Growth in the total amount of debt outstanding

— The total size of the U.S. high-grade
    corporate bond market had increased significantly from
    approximately $753 billion in gross amount of new bonds
    issued in 2005 to $1,128 billion in 2007. During 2008,
    high-grade corporate bond issuance declined to $706 billion
    as risk aversion among corporate bond investors limited the
    ability of issuers across a wide range of industries, in
    particular the financial services industry, to issue new
    corporate bonds. The credit markets demonstrated significant
    improvement throughout 2009 and an increase in new issues of
    high-grade corporate bonds



compared to 2008. Approximately 30% of the total corporate bond
    issuance in 2009 was government guaranteed.

European
    High-Grade Corporate Bond Market

The European high-grade corporate bond market consists of a
    broad range of products, issuers and currencies. We define the
    European high-grade corporate bond market generally to consist
    of bonds intended to be distributed to European investors,
    primarily bonds issued by European corporations, excluding bonds
    that are issued by a corporation domiciled in an emerging
    markets country and excluding most government bonds that trade
    in Europe. Examples include:

•

bonds issued by European corporations, denominated in any
    currency;

•

bonds generally denominated in Euros, U.S. dollars or
    Pounds Sterling, excluding bonds that are issued by a
    corporation domiciled in an emerging market;

•

bonds issued by supra-national organizations (entities that
    include a number of central banks or government financial
    authorities, such as the World Bank), agencies and governments
    located in Europe, generally denominated in Euros,
    U.S. dollars or Pounds Sterling, provided that such
    currency is not the currency of the country where the bond was
    issued; and

•

floating-rate notes issued by European corporations.

We believe that the European high-grade corporate bond market is
    impacted by many of the same factors as the U.S. high-grade
    corporate bond market. In addition, we believe the following
    factors are unique to the European high-grade corporate bond
    market:

•

Regulatory environment

— Certain European Union
    countries have eased restrictions that required institutional
    investors to invest primarily in domestic securities. This has
    provided European institutional investors with increased
    flexibility to invest in securities issued by entities domiciled
    in other countries within the European Union. On
    November 1, 2007, the Markets in Financial Instruments
    Directive (“MiFID”) came into effect. MiFID is
    designed to further harmonize the financial markets of the
    member states of the European Union and introduces new pre- and
    post-trade transparency requirements.

•

Common liquidity pool

— The larger capital pool
    created by the common currency and changes in the regulatory
    environment have facilitated bond issuance by European
    corporations.



Emerging
    Markets Bond Market

We define the emerging markets bond market generally to include
    U.S. dollar, Euro or local currency denominated bonds
    issued by sovereign entities or corporations domiciled in a
    developing country. These issuers are typically located in Latin
    America, Asia, or Central and Eastern Europe. Examples of
    countries we classify as emerging markets include: Brazil,
    Colombia, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Turkey and
    Venezuela.

The institutional investor base for emerging markets bonds
    includes many crossover investors from the high-yield and
    high-grade investment areas. Institutional investors have been
    drawn to emerging markets bonds by their high returns and high
    growth potential. Demand for emerging markets bonds declined
    significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008 as the turmoil in
    the credit markets and the world-wide recession impacted the
    emerging markets. As a result, emerging markets bond prices as
    measured by the JPMorgan emerging markets sovereign external
    debt and corporate bond indices fell steeply in 2008 but have
    now recovered and as of December 31, 2009 were up 13.7% and
    14.4%, respectively, from December 31, 2007 levels.

Crossover
    and High-Yield Bond Market

We define the high-yield bond market generally to include all
    debt rated lower than BBB- by Standard & Poor’s
    or Baa3 by Moody’s Investor Service. We define the
    crossover market to include any debt issue rated below
    investment grade by one agency but investment grade by the
    other. The total amount of high-yield corporate bonds yearly
    issuance has grown from $130.9 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2003 to approximately $136.3 billion for
    the year ended December 31, 2007. During 2008, high-yield
    corporate bond issuance declined to $52.2 billion,
    primarily due to the risk aversion among corporate bond
    investors that severely limited the ability of high-yield
    issuers to raise new debt. The high-yield corporate bond markets
    demonstrated significant improvement throughout 2009, with new
    issuance for the year ended December 31, 2009 increasing to
    $180.7 billion.

FINRA publicly disseminates real-time price information on
    approximately 12,000 high-yield corporate bond issues and
    certain other transactions on a delayed basis. Trades in bonds
    rated BB and lower are subject to immediate dissemination if the
    trade size is less than $1 million, or greater than
    $1 million and trades an average of once or more a day. The
    average daily trading volume of high-yield bonds reported by
    FINRA for the year ended December 31, 2009 was
    $5.0 billion.

Agency
    Bond Market

We define the agency bond market to include debt issued by a
    U.S. government-sponsored enterprise. Some prominent
    issuers of agency bonds are the Federal National Mortgage
    Association (“Fannie Mae”) and Federal Home Loan
    Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”). The total amount
    of U.S. agency bonds outstanding has grown from $1.9
    trillion as of December 31, 2000 to $2.8 trillion as of
    September 30, 2009 but is $0.4 trillion below the total
    amount outstanding as of September 30, 2008. The Federal
    Reserve Bank of New York reported average daily trading volume
    in federal agency and government sponsored enterprise coupon
    securities (excluding mortgage-backed securities) for 2009 of
    $18.2 billion.

Credit
    Default Swap Market

Credit default swaps are contracts on an underlying asset that
    transfer risk and return from one party to another without
    transferring ownership of the underlying asset, allowing market
    participants to obtain credit protection or assume credit
    exposure associated with a broad range of issuers of
    fixed-income securities and other debt obligations. The trading
    volumes and notional amount outstanding in CDS transactions grew
    rapidly between 2002 and 2007. However, since 2007 activity in
    the CDS market has declined substantially due to concern over
    the risks associated with these products, in particular the
    counterparty credit risks. As a result, the notional amount of
    CDS outstanding declined to $31.2 trillion as of June 30,
    2009 from $62.2 trillion as of December 31, 2007. To
    address the counterparty credit concerns, structural changes are
    occurring in the CDS market that include the creation of CDS
    clearing houses that serve as central counterparties for CDS
    transactions. We believe that the introduction of the clearing
    houses is likely to result in more standardized contracts and
    greater price transparency. Further regulatory reform in the CDS
    markets has been proposed to address the risks associated with
    these products.



Our
    Competitive Strengths

Our electronic trading platform provides solutions to some of
    the shortcomings of traditional bond trading methods. The
    benefits of our solution are demonstrable throughout the trading
    cycle:

•

Pre-trade

— gathering real-time and historical
    pricing information, identifying interested buyers and sellers
    in a particular security, and obtaining research and analysis;

•

Trade

— single and multiple security trade
    execution; and

•

Post-trade

— trade detail matching, account
    allocation and automated audit trail.

We believe that we are well positioned to strengthen our market
    position in electronic trading in our existing products and to
    extend our presence into new products and services by
    capitalizing on our competitive strengths, including:

Significant
    Trading Volumes with Participation by Leading Broker-Dealers and
    Institutional Investors

Our electronic trading platform provides access to the liquidity
    provided through the participation on our platform of 67
    broker-dealers, including the majority of the leading
    broker-dealers in global fixed-income trading, and 730 active
    institutional investor firms. We believe these broker-dealers
    represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity for
    U.S. high-grade corporate bonds, European high-grade
    corporate bonds, emerging markets bonds and the other markets in
    which we operate. Our broker-dealer clients are motivated to
    continue to utilize our platform due to the presence on the
    platform of our large network of institutional investor clients.
    We believe that our addition of 19 new broker-dealer clients
    during 2009, has improved and will continue to improve the
    liquidity on our electronic trading platform for institutional
    investors further motivating them to use our platform. The
    number of our active institutional investor clients for the past
    five years has been as follows:



Our total trading volume over the past five years is indicated

Our volume in U.S. high-grade corporate bonds grew from
    approximately 7.6% of total U.S. high-grade corporate bond
    volume, excluding convertible bonds, in 2005 as reported by
    FINRA TRACE, which includes inter-dealer and retail trading as
    well as trading between institutional investors and
    broker-dealers, to approximately 9.4% in 2007. However,
    following the turmoil and resultant lack of liquidity in the
    credit markets since the third quarter of 2007, our estimated
    market share declined to approximately 6.2% for the full year
    2009. Our volume in U.S. high-grade floating rate note
    bonds declined from $46.0 billion in 2007 to
    $6.6 billion in 2009. The credit markets demonstrated
    significant improvement throughout 2009 and our estimated share
    grew substantially during the second half of the year. Our
    estimated share of total U.S. high-grade corporate bond
    volume for the fourth quarter of 2009 was approximately 8.1%.
    Our estimated market share from 2005 to 2009 is shown in the
    chart below:

We have not identified a reliable source of data relating to the
    size of most of the other markets we serve and therefore we are
    unable to accurately determine the total volume of secondary
    trading of these bonds or the portion of such trading conducted
    on our platform.



Execution
    Benefits to Clients

Benefits
    to Institutional Investor Clients

We believe we provide numerous benefits to our institutional
    investor clients over traditional fixed-income trading methods,
    including:

Competitive Prices.

By enabling institutional
    investors to simultaneously request bids or offers from our
    broker-dealer clients, we believe our electronic trading
    platform creates an environment that motivates our broker-dealer
    clients to provide competitive prices and gives institutional
    investors confidence that they are obtaining a competitive
    price. For typical MarketAxess multi-dealer corporate bond
    inquiries prior to 2008, the range of competitive

spread-to-Treasury

responses was, on average, approximately 10 basis points (a
    basis point is


/


of 1% in yield), although in 2008 that range widened to
    35 basis points and it declined to 25 basis points in
    2009. As an example of the potential cost savings to
    institutional investors, a one basis point savings on a
    $1 million face amount trade of a bond with 10 years
    to maturity translates to aggregate savings of approximately
    $750.00.

Transparent Pricing on a Range of
    Securities.

The commingled multi-dealer inventory
    of bonds posted by our broker-dealer clients on our platform
    consists of a daily average of more than $70 billion in
    indicative bids and offers. Subject to applicable regulatory
    requirements, institutional investors can search bonds in
    inventory based on any combination of issuer, issue, rating,
    maturity,

spread-to-Treasury,

size and dealer providing the listing, in a fraction of the time
    it takes to do so manually. Institutional investor clients can
    also request executable bids and offers on our electronic
    trading platform on any debt security in a database of
    U.S. and European corporate bonds, although there can be no
    assurance as to the number of broker-dealers who will choose to
    provide an executable price. Our platform transmits bid and
    offer requests in real-time to broker-dealer clients, who may
    respond with executable prices within a time period specified by
    the institutional investor. Institutional investors may also
    elect to display live requests for bids or offers anonymously to
    all other users of our electronic trading platform, in order to
    create broader visibility of their inquiry among market
    participants and increase the likelihood that the request
    results in a trade. We believe that broader participation in
    client inquiries will result in more trade matches and lower
    transaction costs.

Improved Cost Efficiency.

We believe that we
    provide improved efficiency by reducing the time and labor
    required to conduct broad product and price discovery.
    Single-security and multi-security (bid or offer lists)
    inquiries can be efficiently conducted with multiple
    broker-dealers. In addition, our Corporate
    BondTicker

tm

eliminates the need for manually-intensive phone calls or

e-mail

communication to gather, sort and analyze information concerning
    historical transaction prices.

Benefits
    to Broker-Dealer Clients

We also provide substantial benefits to our broker-dealer
    clients over traditional fixed-income trading methods, including:

Greater Sales Efficiency.

We offer our
    broker-dealer clients broad connectivity with their
    institutional investor clients. Through this connectivity, our
    broker-dealer clients are able to efficiently display their
    indications of interest to buy and sell various securities. We
    also enable broker-dealers to broaden their distribution by
    participating in transactions to which they otherwise may not
    have had access. In addition, the ability to post prices and
    electronically execute on straightforward trades enables bond
    sales professionals at broker-dealer firms to focus their
    efforts on more profitable activities, such as higher
    value-added trades and more complex transactions.

More Efficient Inventory Management.

The
    posting of inventory to, and the ability to respond to inquiries
    from, a broad pool of institutional investors, creates an
    increased opportunity for broker-dealers to identify demand for
    their inventory, particularly in less liquid securities. As a
    result, we believe they can achieve enhanced bond inventory
    turnover, which may limit credit exposure.



Benefits
    to Both Institutional Investor and Broker-Dealer
    Clients

We offer additional benefits over traditional fixed-income
    trading methods that are shared by both institutional investor
    and broker-dealer clients, including:

Greater Trading Accuracy.

Our electronic
    trading platform includes verification mechanisms at various
    stages of the execution process which result in greater accuracy
    in the processing, confirming and clearing of trades between
    institutional investor and broker-dealer clients. These
    verification mechanisms are designed to ensure that our
    broker-dealer and institutional investor clients are sending
    accurate trade messages by providing multiple opportunities to
    verify they are trading the correct bond, at the

agreed-upon

price and size. Our platform assists our institutional investor
    clients in automating the transmittal of order tickets from the
    portfolio manager to the trader, and from the trader to
    back-office personnel. This automation provides more timely
    execution and a reduction in the likelihood of errors that can
    result from information being manually entered into different
    systems.

Efficient Risk Monitoring and
    Compliance.

Institutional investors and their
    regulators are increasingly focused on ensuring that best
    execution is achieved for fixed-income trades. Our electronic
    trading platform offers both institutional investors and
    broker-dealers an automated audit trail for each stage in the
    trading cycle. This enables compliance personnel to review
    information relating to trades more easily and with greater
    reliability. Trade information including time, price and

spread-to-Treasury

is stored securely and automatically on our electronic trading
    platform. This data represents a valuable source of information
    for our clients’ compliance personnel. Importantly, we
    believe the automated audit trail, together with the competitive
    pricing that is a feature of our electronic trading platform,
    gives fiduciaries the ability to demonstrate that they have
    achieved best execution on behalf of their clients.

Other
    Service Offerings

In addition to services directly related to the execution of
    trades, we offer our clients several other services, including:

Information Services.

The information and
    analytical tools we provide to our clients help them make
    investment and trading decisions. Our Corporate
    BondTicker

tm

provides access to real-time and historical price, yield and
    MarketAxess estimated

spread-to-Treasuries

for publicly disseminated FINRA TRACE-eligible bonds. Corporate
    BondTicker

tm

combines publicly-available TRACE data with the prices for
    trades executed on our U.S. high-grade electronic trading
    platform, integrating the two data sources and providing
    real-time TRACE data with associated analytical tools that are
    not otherwise available. Corporate
    BondTicker

tm

provides

end-of-day

CDS pricing data combined with CDS analytics and screening tools
    that incorporate cash bond and equity market data. In addition,
    Corporate
    BondTicker

tm

provides indicative prices for secondary loans, through
    arrangements with certain of our broker-dealer clients, and
    independent third-party credit research. Our electronic trading
    platform allows institutional investors to compile, sort and use
    information to discover investment opportunities that might have
    been difficult or impossible to identify using a manual
    information gathering process or other electronic services.

We offer a comprehensive set of reports designed to review and
    monitor credit trading activity for institutional investor
    clients. It utilizes extensive TRACE information and has a
    flexible interface to run and save reports in a variety of
    formats for both compliance and management reporting. For
    example, the best execution report provides a view of the
    savings generated by trading on our electronic trading platform
    and offers a quantitative measure of the value of price
    discovery from multiple dealers. The report allows clients to
    monitor performance against their own best execution policy. Our
    compliance product provides a printed history of each inquiry
    submitted through the MarketAxess trading platform.

Straight-Through Processing.

Straight-through
    processing (“STP”) refers to the integration of
    systems and processes to automate the trade process from

end-to-end —

trade execution, confirmation and settlement — without
    the need for manual intervention. Our electronic trading
    platform provides broker-dealers and institutional investors
    with the ability to automate portions of their transaction
    processing requirements, improving accuracy and efficiency.
    Through electronic messaging, institutional investors can submit
    inquiries to, and receive electronic notices of execution from
    us, in industry standard protocols, complete with all relevant
    trade details. Institutional



investors can download trade messages, allocate trades to

sub-accounts

on whose behalf the trades were made and send the allocations to
    broker-dealers for confirmation.

Technology Products and Services.

In addition
    to our trading platform, we provide a suite of technology
    products. In November 2007, we formed a new subsidiary,
    MarketAxess Technologies Inc., which acquired certain assets of
    Trade West Systems, LLC (“TWS”). TWS is an Utah-based
    financial software and technology services provider focused on
    providing gateway adapters for connecting order management
    systems and trading systems to fixed-income trading venues. In
    March 2008, we acquired Greenline Financial Technologies, Inc.
    (“Greenline”), an Illinois-based provider of
    integration, testing and management solutions for FIX-related
    products and services designed to optimize the electronic
    trading of fixed-income, equity and other exchange-based
    products.

Robust,
    Scalable Technology

We have developed proprietary technology that is highly secure,
    fault-tolerant and provides adequate capacity for our current
    operations, as well as for substantial growth. Our highly
    scalable systems are designed to accommodate additional volume,
    products and clients with relatively little modification and low
    incremental costs.

Proven
    Innovator with an Experienced Management Team

Since our inception, we have been an innovator in the
    fixed-income securities markets. Our management team is
    comprised of executives with an average of more than
    20 years’ experience in the securities industry. We
    have consistently sought to benefit participants in the markets
    we serve by attempting to replicate the essential features of
    fixed-income trading, including the existing relationships
    between broker-dealers and their institutional investor clients,
    while applying technology to eliminate weaknesses in traditional
    trading methods. In 2009,

Credit

magazine recognized
    MarketAxess as “Best Trading Platform (Multi-Dealer to
    Client)” in the U.S. and “Best

e-Trading

Platform for Corporate Bonds and CDS” in Europe.

Some of the innovations we have introduced to electronic trading
    include:

•

the first multi-dealer disclosed trading platform for
    U.S. high-grade corporate bonds;

•

the first electronic Treasury benchmarking for
    U.S. high-grade corporate bond trades;

•

Corporate
    BondTicker

TM

,

    our information services product, combining FINRA TRACE bond
    data with MarketAxess data and analytical tools;

•

bid and offer list technology for corporate bond trading,
    enabling institutional investors to request executable prices
    for multiple securities simultaneously;

•

the first disclosed client to multi-dealer trading platform for
    CDS indices; and

•

public Market Lists for corporate bonds, giving institutional
    investors the ability to display their bid and offer lists
    anonymously to the entire MarketAxess trading community.

Our
    Strategy

Our objective is to provide the leading global electronic
    trading platform for fixed-income securities, connecting
    broker-dealers and institutional investors more easily and
    efficiently, while offering a broad array of information,
    trading and technology services to market participants across
    the trading cycle. The key elements of our strategy are:

Enhance
    the Liquidity of Securities Traded on Our Platform and Broaden
    Our Client Base in Our Existing Markets

We intend to further enhance the liquidity of securities traded
    on our leading electronic, multi-dealer to client fixed-income
    platform. Our ability to innovate and efficiently add new
    functionality and product offerings to the MarketAxess platform
    will help us deepen our market share with our existing clients,
    as well as expand our client base, which we believe will in turn
    lead to even further increases in the liquidity of the
    securities provided by our



broker-dealer clients and available on our platform. We will
    seek to increase the number of active European institutional
    investor clients using our U.S. electronic trading
    platform, subject to regulatory requirements.

Leverage
    our Existing Technology and Client Relationships to Expand into
    New Sectors of the

Fixed-Income

Securities Market

We intend to leverage our technology, as well as our strong
    broker-dealer and institutional investor relationships, to
    deploy our electronic trading platform into additional product
    segments within the fixed-income securities markets and deliver
    fixed-income securities-related technical services and products.
    Due in part to our highly scalable systems, we believe we will
    be able to enter new markets efficiently.

Leverage
    our Existing Technology and Client Relationships to Expand into
    New Client Segments

We intend to leverage our technology and client relationships to
    deploy our electronic trading platform into new client segments.
    As an example, in 2008 and 2009 we expanded the base of
    broker-dealers on our platform to include both regional and
    diversity dealers.

Continue
    to Strengthen and Expand our Trade-Related Service
    Offerings

We plan to continue building our existing service offerings so
    that our electronic trading platform is more fully integrated
    into the workflow of our broker-dealer and institutional
    investor clients. We also plan to continue to add functionality
    to enhance the ability of our clients to achieve a fully
    automated,

end-to-end

straight-through processing solution (automation from trade
    initiation to settlement). We are continually considering the
    introduction of new trading techniques. As an example, in the
    fourth quarter of 2008, we introduced public Market Lists for
    corporate bonds that give institutional investors the ability to
    display live requests for bids and offers anonymously to the
    entire MarketAxess trading community.

Expand
    our Data and Information Services Offerings

We regularly add new content and analytical capabilities to
    Corporate
    BondTicker

tm

in order to improve the value of the information we provide to
    our clients. We intend to continue to widen the user base of our
    data products and to continue adding new content and analytical
    capabilities. As the use of our electronic trading platform
    continues to grow, we believe that the amount and value of our
    proprietary trading data will also increase, further enhancing
    the value of our information services offerings to our clients.

Expand
    our Technology Services Offerings

We intend to leverage our technology expertise and our client
    relationships to provide technology solutions to our clients
    that enhance their electronic trading capabilities and
    facilitate the electronic communication of order information
    with their trading counterparties. In November 2007, we acquired
    TWS, a financial software and technology services provider
    focused on providing gateway adapters for connecting order
    management systems and trading systems to fixed-income trading
    venues. In March 2008, we acquired Greenline, an Illinois-based
    provider of integration, testing and management solutions for
    FIX-related products and services.

Pursue
    Strategic Alliances and Select Acquisitions

We plan to continue to increase and supplement our internal
    growth by entering into strategic alliances, or acquiring
    businesses or technologies, that will enable us to enter new
    markets, provide new products or services, or otherwise enhance
    the value of our platform to our clients. Examples of this are
    our acquisitions of TWS and Greenline.



MarketAxess
    Electronic Trading Platform

Key
    Trading Functionalities

The key trading functionalities are detailed below.

Single
    Inquiry Trading Functionality

We currently offer institutional investors the ability to
    request bids or offers in a single inquiry from up to 50 of our
    broker-dealer clients for U.S. high-grade corporate bonds,
    from up to six of our broker-dealer clients for European
    high-grade corporate bonds and from up to eight of our
    broker-dealer clients in emerging markets bonds. Institutional
    investors can obtain bids or offers on any security posted in
    inventory or included in the database available on our platform.

ASAP and
    Holding Bin Trading Functionalities

We provide both ASAP (“as soon as possible”) and
    Holding Bin trading protocols. In the Holding Bin trading
    protocol, institutional investor clients set the time when they
    would like all of the broker-dealers’ prices or spreads
    returned to them, in order to have the ability to see all
    executable prices available at the same time. In the ASAP
    trading protocol, institutional investor clients see each
    broker-dealer’s price or spread as soon as it is entered by
    the broker-dealer.

List
    Trading Functionality

We currently offer institutional investors the ability to
    request bids or offers on a list of up to 40 bonds depending on
    the market. This facilitates efficient trading for institutional
    investors such as investment advisors, mutual funds and hedge
    funds. Institutional investors are able to have multiple lists
    executable throughout the trading day, enabling them to manage
    their daily cash flows, portfolio duration, and credit and
    sector exposure.

Swap
    Trading Functionality

We currently offer institutional investors the ability to
    request an offer to purchase one bond and a bid to sell another
    bond, in a manner such that the two trades will be executed
    simultaneously, with payment based on the price or yield
    differential of the securities.

Market
    Lists

We offer institutional investors the ability to display live
    requests for bids and offers anonymously to the entire
    MarketAxess trading community through our Market List
    functionality, thereby creating broader visibility of their
    inquiry among market participants and increasing the likelihood
    that the request results in a trade.

Markets

U.S.
    High-Grade Corporate Bonds

Our U.S. high-grade corporate bond business consists of
    U.S. dollar-denominated investment-grade debt issued by
    corporations for distribution in the U.S. Both domestic and
    foreign institutional investors have access to
    U.S. high-grade corporate bond trading on our electronic
    trading platform. We use the terms high-grade debt and
    investment-grade debt interchangeably in this annual report on

Form 10-K.

Our 2009 trading volume in the U.S. high-grade corporate
    bond market was $177.1 billion.

In the U.S. high-grade corporate bond market, 50
    broker-dealers utilize our platform, including 18 of the top 20
    broker-dealers as ranked by 2009 investment grade new-issue
    underwriting volume. We added 19 dealers during 2009. Our
    broker-dealer clients accounted for approximately 97.2% of the
    underwriting of newly-issued U.S. high-grade corporate
    bonds in 2009.

We offer our institutional investor clients access to a broad
    inventory of U.S. high-grade corporate bonds, which is
    provided and updated daily by our broker-dealer clients. Our
    electronic trading platform allows



institutional investors to view bids and offers from one or more
    of our broker-dealer clients while permitting each party to know
    the identity of its counter-party throughout the trading
    process. Our disclosed inquiry trading functionality combines
    the strength of existing offline client/dealer relationships
    with the efficiency and transparency of an electronic trading
    platform. This enables institutional investors to instantly
    direct trade inquiries and negotiations to their traditional
    broker-dealer or to any of the substantial majority of the
    world’s leading broker-dealers who provide liquidity in
    these securities. Through our Market List functionality, we also
    offer institutional investors the ability to display their live
    requests for bid and offer lists anonymously to the entire
    MarketAxess trading community as a means of creating broader
    visibility of their inquiry among market participants and
    increasing the likelihood that the request results in a trade.
    Institutional investors have access to the commingled inventory
    of our broker-dealer clients, representing indicative bids and
    offers. Each line item of inventory represents an indicative bid

and/or

offer
    on a particular bond issue by a particular broker-dealer client.
    Institutional investor clients are not restricted to trading
    only the bonds posted as inventory, although many of the trades
    conducted on our platform are made from the posted inventory. To
    transact in a specific bond that does not appear in inventory,
    institutional investors can easily search our database and
    submit an online inquiry to their chosen broker-dealers, who can
    respond with live, executable prices. While, on average,
    institutional investor clients receive several bids or offers
    from broker-dealers in response to trade inquiries, some
    inquiries may not receive any bids or offers.

Eurobonds

MarketAxess Europe Limited, our wholly-owned U.K. subsidiary,
    commenced trading operations in August 2001. MarketAxess Europe
    Limited received Financial Services Authority (“FSA”)
    regulatory approval and began to offer European secondary
    trading functionality in U.S. dollar- and Euro-denominated
    European corporate bonds to our broker-dealer and institutional
    investor clients in September 2001. We offered the first
    platform in Europe with a multi-dealer disclosed counterparty
    trading capability for corporate bonds. In 2003, we added
    trading in other European high-grade corporate bonds, including
    bonds issued in Pounds Sterling and floating rate notes. In
    2008, we introduced trading in European government bonds and in
    2009 introduced trading in bonds denominated in non-core
    currencies. In 2009, MarketAxess Europe Limited received FSA
    regulatory approval to trade on a riskless principal basis.

In the Eurobond credit market, defined as including European
    high-grade, high yield and government bonds, 21 broker-dealers
    utilize our platform, including 16 of the top 20 broker-dealers
    as ranked by 2009 European investment grade new-issue
    underwriting volume. On a typical day, institutional investors
    on our European corporate bond trading platform have access to
    8,000 line items of commingled inventory, representing an
    aggregate of approximately $27 billion of indicative bids
    and offers. In a single inquiry, institutional investors can
    request bids or offers from up to six of the broker-dealers who
    participate on the European platform. While many of the trades
    conducted on our platform are made from the posted inventory,
    institutional investor clients are not restricted to trading
    only the bonds posted as inventory. To transact in a specific
    bond that does not appear in inventory, institutional investors
    can easily search our database and submit an online inquiry to
    their chosen broker-dealers, who can respond with live,
    executable prices. While, on average, institutional investor
    clients receive several bids or offers from broker-dealers in
    response to trade inquiries, some inquiries may not receive any
    bids or offers. Our 2009 trading volume in the Eurobond market
    was $56.8 billion.

Emerging
    Markets Bonds

Twenty-nine of our U.S. broker-dealer clients use our
    platform to trade emerging markets bonds. 302 active
    institutional investor clients (firms that executed at least one
    trade through our electronic trading platform between January
    2009 and December 2009) utilize our electronic trading
    platform to trade emerging markets bonds. These institutional
    investor clients are located in both the U.S. and Europe.
    The emerging markets countries whose bonds were most frequently
    traded on our platform in 2009 were Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela,
    Russia and Colombia.

In December 2007, we introduced local markets emerging market
    debt trading, which allows our institutional investor clients to
    transact Euroclear-eligible local currency denominated bonds
    issued by sovereign entities or corporations in countries that
    include Mexico, Brazil and Argentina.



Crossover
    and High-Yield Bonds

Forty-six of our U.S. broker-dealer clients use our
    platform to trade crossover and high-yield bonds. Trading in
    crossover and high-yield bonds uses many of the same features
    available in our U.S. high-grade corporate bond offering.

Agency
    Bonds

Twenty-five of our U.S. broker-dealer clients use our
    platform to trade agency bonds. Trading in agency bonds uses
    many of the same features available in our U.S. high-grade
    corporate bond offering.

Credit
    Default Swaps

We offer CDS index trading on our platform and also offer the
    capacity to trade lists of single-name CDS. In addition to the
    trading features, the index trading platform also offers STP
    connectivity for dealers and institutional investor clients. In
    2009, we conformed our platform to the new standardized credit
    default swap calculation methodologies.

Corporate
    BondTicker

TM

provides real-time FINRA TRACE data and enhances it with
    MarketAxess trade data and analytical tools to provide
    professional market participants with a comprehensive set of
    corporate bond price information. The data include trade time
    and sales information, including execution prices, as well as
    MarketAxess-estimated

spread-to-Treasuries,

for trades disseminated by the FINRA TRACE system. The data also
    include actual execution prices and

    on the MarketAxess platform. Corporate
    BondTicker

TM

allows institutional investors to search for and sort bonds
    based upon specific criteria, such as volume, time/date of
    transaction, spread change, issuer or security. This search
    function allows institutional investors to compile information
    relating to potential securities trades in a fraction of the
    time that it takes to manually compile this information from
    disparate sources or other electronic databases, including
    direct TRACE feeds. Corporate
    BondTicker

TM

also offers

end-of-day

CDS pricing data provided by Credit Market Analysis Ltd.

End-of-day

    bonds and equities to provide relative value analysis to our
    clients. In addition, Corporate
    BondTicker

TM

provides independent third-party credit research as well as
    indicative prices for secondary markets in loans and CDS.

TRACE facilitates the mandatory reporting of

over-the-counter

secondary market transactions in eligible fixed-income
    securities. All broker-dealers that are FINRA member firms have
    an obligation to report transactions in corporate bonds to TRACE
    under a set of rules approved by the U.S. Securities and
    Exchange Commission (“SEC”). FINRA then publicly
    disseminates a portion of this data, which is available free of
    charge on a delayed basis through the FINRA website or available
    immediately for a set fee.

    the information via an easy-to-use browser-based interface.

We provide Corporate
    BondTicker

    distribution agreements with other information service providers
    and through bulk data sales to third parties. Seat license fees
    are waived for clients that transact a sufficient volume of
    trades through MarketAxess.

Additional analytical capabilities of our information services
    offerings aim to provide clients with more information regarding
    bond prices and market activity, including asset swap spreads,
    turnover percentage and liquidity ratios. These statistics
    measure a security’s trading activity relative to its
    amount outstanding and relative



to the overall market, respectively, providing an additional
    perspective on relative liquidity. In addition, we provide
    pricing measures to help institutional investors better assess
    the relative value of a corporate bond, providing more
    consistent relative pricing information for institutional
    investors, such as offering spread data versus the interest rate
    swap curve and versus the U.S. Treasury curve. Users are
    also able to download a variety of MarketAxess-compiled trade
    reports containing a comprehensive review of trading activity.
    Corporate
    BondTicker

TM

is currently the source of corporate bond trading information
    for

The Wall Street Journal.

We also offer a comprehensive set of reports designed to review
    and monitor credit trading activity for institutional investor
    clients. It utilizes extensive TRACE information and has a
    flexible interface to run and save reports in a variety of
    formats for both compliance and management reporting. For
    example, the best execution report provides a view of the
    savings generated by trading on our electronic trading platform
    and offers a quantitative measure of the value of price
    discovery from multiple dealers. The report allows clients to
    monitor performance against their own best execution policy. Our
    compliance product provides a printed history of each inquiry
    submitted through the MarketAxess trading platform.

My
    Portfolio

Institutional investors are able to upload their corporate bond
    portfolio to our electronic trading platform utilizing the
    “My Portfolio” trading feature. Institutional
    investors who utilize “My Portfolio” benefit from the
    ability to automatically match inventory on our platform to
    bonds held in their portfolio, allowing them to more efficiently
    launch an inquiry and transact in these securities. Users of
    this feature can also directly access Corporate
    BondTicker

tm

to obtain the trading history of the securities in their
    portfolio.

Straight-Through
    Processing

Straight-through processing refers to the integration of systems
    and processes to automate the trade process from

end-to-end —

trade execution, confirmation and settlement — without
    the need for manual intervention. There are two elements of
    straight-through processing: internal straight-through
    processing and external straight-through processing. Internal
    straight-through processing relates to the trade and settlement
    processes that are internal to an industry participant. For
    example, in the case of an institutional investor, this includes
    authorization of orders, placement of orders with
    broker-dealers, receipt of execution details and allocation of
    trades. External straight-through processing refers to
    connecting seamlessly to all external counterparts in the
    trading and settlement process.

Automation by way of straight-through processing improves
    efficiency throughout the trade cycle. We provide broker-dealers
    and institutional investors with a range of tools that
    facilitate straight-through processing, including order upload,
    easy-to-use online allocation tools and pre- and post-trade
    messaging features that enable institutional investors to
    communicate electronically between front- and back-office
    systems, thereby integrating the order, portfolio management and
    accounting systems of our broker-dealer and institutional
    investor clients in real time. Our straight-through processing
    tools can be customized to meet specific needs of clients. We
    continue to build industry partnerships to assist our clients in
    creating connectivity throughout the trade cycle. Through these
    partnerships, we are increasingly providing solutions that can
    quickly be deployed within our clients’ trading operations.

Usage of our straight-through processing tools increased
    significantly during the last several years. The number of
    investor client STP connections increased to 210 as of
    December 31, 2009 from 134 as of December 31, 2007. In
    our U.S. high-grade corporate bond business between 2006
    and 2009, the number of trades completed through our
    straight-through processing capabilities increased from 32,056
    to 95,169. The number of online allocations increased from
    83,501 to 166,161 between 2006 and 2009.

Dealer
    API

We offer Application Programming Interface (“API”)
    services to our broker-dealer clients for pre-trade, trade
    negotiation and post-trade services. This allows for
    straight-through processing, which improves efficiency and
    reduces errors in processing.



Technology
    Services

In November 2007, we formed a new subsidiary company,
    MarketAxess Technologies Inc., which acquired TWS, a financial
    software and technology services company focused on providing
    gateway adapters to connect order management and trading systems
    to fixed-income trading venues.

In March 2008, we acquired Greenline, an Illinois-based provider
    of integration, testing and management solutions for FIX related
    products and services. The FIX protocol is a messaging standard
    developed specifically for the real-time electronic exchange of
    securities transaction information. Greenline’s CertiFIX
    product enables firms to provide a reliable FIX certification
    environment for their trading counterparties. The VeriFIX
    product is a testing suite that allows firms to thoroughly test
    counterparty FIX interfaces, protocol formats and supported
    messages. Greenline’s MagniFIX product allows firms to
    monitor their enterprise-wide FIX installations on a real-time
    basis. In addition, Greenline provides strategic consulting and
    custom development for their clients.

We also provide technology consulting and customized development
    services to our clients that leverage our trading technology
    expertise and our existing technology solutions. Fees for such
    services are charged based upon the complexity and extent of the
    services provided.

Sales and
    Marketing

We promote our products and services using a variety of direct
    and indirect sales and marketing strategies. Our sales force is
    responsible for client acquisition activity and for increasing
    use of our platform by our existing clients. Their goal is to
    train and support existing and new clients on how to use the
    system and to educate them as to the benefits of utilizing an
    electronic fixed-income trading platform. We employ various
    strategies, including advertising, direct marketing, promotional
    mailings and participation in industry conferences, to increase
    awareness of our brand and our electronic trading platform. For
    example, we have worked with

The Wall Street Journal

to
    establish Corporate
    BondTicker

TM

as the source of information for its daily corporate bond and
    high-yield tables.

Competition

The electronic trading industry is highly competitive and we
    expect competition to intensify in the future. We face five main
    areas of competition:

•

Telephone

— We compete with bond trading
    business conducted over the telephone between broker-dealers and
    their institutional investor clients. Institutional investors
    have historically purchased fixed-income securities by
    telephoning bond sales professionals at one or more
    broker-dealers and inquiring about the price and availability of
    individual bonds. This remains the manner in which the majority
    of corporate bonds are still traded between institutional
    investors and broker-dealers.

•

E-mail

— We compete with bond trading business conducted
    via

e-mail

between broker-dealers and their institutional investor clients.

E-mail

provides an efficient means of initiating product and price
    discovery with a large universe of potential trading partners.

•

Other electronic trading platforms

— There are
    numerous other electronic trading platforms currently in
    existence. These include: Thomson TradeWeb, a multi-dealer to
    institutional investor trading platform that has historically
    focused on government bond trading; Bloomberg, which provides
    electronic trading functionality; and the New York Stock
    Exchange, which launched a retail corporate bond trading
    platform in April 2007. In addition, some broker-dealers operate
    proprietary electronic trading systems that enable institutional
    investors to trade directly with a broker-dealer over an
    electronic medium. We believe that we are currently the only
    platform primarily focused on multi-party disclosed trading of
    credit products between broker-dealers and institutional
    investors, though others have or may seek to expand their
    product offerings to compete in this market. Additionally, as we
    expand our business into new products, we will likely come into
    more direct competition with other electronic trading platforms
    or firms offering traditional services.

•

Market data and information vendors

— Several
    large market data and information providers currently have a
    data and analytics relationship with virtually every
    institutional firm. Some of these entities, including Bloomberg,
    currently offer varying forms of electronic trading of
    fixed-income securities, mostly on a



single-dealer basis. Some of these entities have announced their
    intention to expand their electronic trading platforms or to
    develop new platforms. These entities are currently direct
    competitors to our information services business and may in the
    future become direct competitors to our electronic trading
    platform.

•

Technology vendors

— We compete with numerous
    providers of FIX message management tools and connectivity
    solutions. The market for our technology products and services
    is fragmented and includes FIX engine providers, testing,
    monitoring, certification and professional services firms and
    in-house technology and development groups at virtually every
    institutional firm.

Competitors, including companies in which some of our
    broker-dealer clients have invested, have developed electronic
    trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore
    the development of electronic trading platforms that compete or
    will compete with us. Furthermore, our broker-dealer clients
    have made, and may in the future make investments in or enter
    into agreements with other businesses that directly or
    indirectly compete with us.

In general, we compete on the basis of a number of key factors,
    including:

•

broad network of broker-dealer and institutional investor
    clients using our electronic trading platform;

•

liquidity provided by the participating broker-dealers;

•

magnitude and frequency of price improvement;

•

facilitating the quality and speed of execution;

•

compliance benefits;

•

total transaction costs;

•

technology capabilities, including the reliability and ease of
    use of our electronic trading platform; and

•

range of products and services offered.

We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these
    factors and continue to proactively build technology solutions
    that serve the needs of the credit markets.

Our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and
    integration of our broker-dealer and institutional investor
    clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems.
    We have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we
    serve in the development of our platform, working closely with
    our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs.

Our broker-dealer clients have invested in building API’s
    with us for inventory contributions, electronic trading,
    government bond benchmark pricing and post-trade messaging. We
    believe that we have successfully built deep roots with our
    broker-dealer clients, increasing our level of service to them
    while at the same time increasing their commitment to our
    services.

Furthermore, 210 of our institutional investor clients have
    built interfaces to enable them to communicate electronically
    between our platform and their order, portfolio management and
    accounting systems. We believe that this increases the reliance
    of these institutional investor clients on our services and
    creates significant competitive barriers to entry.

Technology

The design and quality of our technology are critical to our
    growth and our ability to execute our business strategy. Our
    electronic trading platform has been designed with secure,
    scalable client-server architecture that makes broad use of
    distributed computing to achieve speed, reliability and fault
    tolerance. The platform is built on industry-standard
    technologies and has been designed to handle many multiples of
    our current trading volume.

All critical server-side components, primarily our networks,
    application servers and databases, have backup equipment running
    in the event that the main equipment fails. This offers fully
    redundant system capacity to maximize uptime and minimize the
    potential for loss of transaction data in the event of an
    internal failure. We also seek to minimize the impact of
    external failures by automatically recovering connections in the
    event of a



communications failure. The majority of our broker-dealer
    clients have dedicated high-speed T-1 communication lines to our
    network in order to provide fast data transfer. Our security
    measures include industry-standard communications encryption.

We have designed our application with an easy-to-use,
    Windows-based interface. Through a secure, single sign-on, our
    clients are able to access our electronic trading platform.
    Clients are also able to execute transactions over our platform
    directly from their order management systems. We provide users
    an automatic software update feature that does not require
    manual intervention.

Intellectual
    Property

We rely upon a combination of copyright, patent, trade secret
    and trademark laws, written agreements and common law to protect
    our proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual
    property. Our software code, elements of our electronic trading
    platform, Web site and other proprietary materials are protected
    by copyright laws. We received five patents in 2009 covering our
    most significant trading protocols and other aspects of our
    trading system technology, and other patents are pending.

The written agreements upon which we rely to protect our
    proprietary technology, processes and intellectual property
    include agreements designed to protect our trade secrets.
    Examples of these written agreements include third party
    nondisclosure agreements, employee nondisclosure and inventions
    assignment agreements, and agreements with customers,
    contractors and strategic partners. Other written agreements
    upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology,
    processes and intellectual property take many forms and contain
    provisions related to patent, copyright, trademark or trade
    secret rights.

We have obtained U.S. federal registration of the
    MarketAxess

®

name and logo, and the same mark and logo have been registered
    in several foreign jurisdictions. We have pending registrations
    for the
    MarketAxess

is a trademark we use, but it has not been registered.

In addition to our efforts to register our intellectual
    property, we believe that factors such as the technological and
    creative skills of our personnel, new product and service
    developments, frequent enhancements and reliability with respect
    to our services are essential to establishing and maintaining a
    technology and market leadership position.

Government
    Regulation

The securities industry and financial markets in the
    U.S. and elsewhere are subject to extensive regulation. As
    a matter of public policy, regulatory bodies in the
    U.S. and the rest of the world are charged with
    safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial
    markets and with protecting the interests of investors
    participating in those markets. Our active broker-dealer
    subsidiaries fall within the scope of their regulations.

Regulation
    of the U.S. Securities Industry and Broker-Dealers

In the U.S., the SEC is the governmental agency responsible for
    the administration of the federal securities laws. One of our
    U.S. subsidiaries, MarketAxess Corporation, is registered
    with the SEC as a broker-dealer. It is also a member of FINRA, a
    self-regulatory organization to which most broker-dealers
    belong. In addition, MarketAxess Corporation is a member of the
    Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which provides
    certain protection for clients’ accounts in the event of a
    liquidation of a broker-dealer to the extent any such accounts
    are held by the broker-dealer.

Additionally, MarketAxess Corporation is registered with certain
    states and the District of Columbia as a broker-dealer. The
    individual states and the District of Columbia are responsible
    for the administration of their respective “blue sky”
    laws, rules and regulations.



Regulation
    of the

Non-U.S.

Securities Industries and Investment Service
    Providers

The securities industry and financial markets in the U.K., the
    European Union and elsewhere are subject to extensive
    regulation. MarketAxess Europe Limited may fall within the scope
    of those regulations depending upon the extent to which it is
    characterized as providing a regulated investment service.

Our principal regulator in the U.K. is the FSA. Our subsidiary,
    MarketAxess Europe Limited, is registered as a Multilateral
    Trading Facility (“MTF”) with the FSA.

The securities industry in the member states of the European
    Union is regulated by agencies in each member state. European
    Union measures provide for the mutual recognition of regulatory
    agencies and of prudential supervision making possible the grant
    of a single authorization for providers of investment services,
    which, in general, is valid throughout the European Union. As an
    FSA-approved MTF, MarketAxess Europe Limited receives the
    benefit of this authorization.

Our Canadian subsidiary, MarketAxess Canada Limited, is
    registered as an Alternative Trading System under the Securities
    Act of Ontario and is a member of the Investment Industry
    Regulatory Organization of Canada.

Employees

As of December 31, 2009, we had 212 employees, 178 of
    whom were based in the U.S. and 34 of whom were based
    outside of the U.S., principally in the U.K. None of our
    employees is represented by a labor union. We consider our
    relationships with our employees to be good and have not
    experienced any interruptions of operations due to labor
    disagreements.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

Risks
    Related to Our Business

We
    face substantial competition that could reduce our market share
    and harm our financial performance.

The fixed-income securities industry generally, and the
    electronic financial services markets in which we operate in
    particular, are highly competitive, and we expect competition to
    intensify in the future. We will continue to compete with bond
    trading conducted directly between broker-dealers and their
    institutional investor clients over the telephone or
    electronically. In addition, our current and prospective
    competitors are numerous and include:

•

other multi-dealer trading companies;

•

market data and information vendors;

•

securities and futures exchanges;

•

inter-dealer brokerage firms;

•

electronic communications networks;

•

technology, software, information and media or other companies
    that have existing commercial relationships with broker-dealers
    or institutional investors; and

•

other electronic marketplaces that are not currently in the
    securities business.

Many of our current and potential competitors are more
    established and substantially larger than we are and have
    substantially greater market presence, as well as greater
    financial, technical, marketing and other resources. These
    competitors may aggressively reduce their pricing to enter into
    market segments in which we have a leadership position today,
    potentially subsidizing any losses with profits from trading in
    other fixed-income or equity securities. In addition, many of
    our competitors offer a wider range of services, have broader
    name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do. Some
    of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving
    opportunities, technologies and customer requirements than we
    can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional
    activities.

Any combination of our competitors may enter into joint ventures
    or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by
    us. Current and new competitors can launch new platforms at a
    relatively low cost. Others may acquire the capabilities
    necessary to compete with us through acquisitions. We expect
    that we will potentially compete with a variety of companies
    with respect to each product or service we offer. If we are not
    able to compete successfully in the future, our business,
    financial condition and results of operations would be adversely
    affected.

Neither
    the sustainability of our current level of business nor any
    potential growth can be assured. Even if we do experience
    growth, we cannot assure you that we will grow
    profitably.

The success of our business strategy depends, in part, on our
    ability to maintain and expand the network of broker-dealer and
    institutional investor clients that use our electronic trading
    platform. Our business strategy also depends on increasing the
    use of our platform by these clients. Individuals at
    broker-dealers or institutional investors may have conflicting
    interests, which may discourage their use of our platform.

Our growth is also dependent on our ability to diversify our
    revenue base. We currently derive approximately half of our
    revenues from secondary trading in U.S. high-grade
    corporate bonds. Our long-term business strategy is dependent on
    expanding our service offerings and increasing our revenues from
    other fixed-income products and other sources. We cannot assure
    you that our efforts will be successful or result in increased
    revenues or continued profitability.



Because
    we operate in a rapidly evolving industry, it is difficult to
    evaluate our business and prospects.

We face risks and difficulties frequently experienced by
    companies operating in rapidly evolving industries, such as the
    electronic financial services industry. These risks and
    difficulties include, but are not limited to, our ability to:

•

attract and retain broker-dealers and institutional investors on
    a cost-effective basis;

•

expand and enhance reliable and cost-effective product and
    service offerings to our clients;

•

respond effectively to competitive pressures;

•

diversify our sources of revenues;

•

maintain adequate control of our expenses;

•

operate, support, expand and develop our operations, website,
    software, communications and other systems;

•

manage growth in personnel and operations;

•

increase awareness of our brand or market positioning;

•

expand our sales and marketing programs; and

•

respond to regulatory changes or demands.

If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks or in executing
    our business strategy, our business, financial condition and
    results of operations may suffer.

Decreases
    in trading volumes in the fixed-income markets generally or on
    our platform would harm our business and
    profitability.

We have experienced significant decreases in overall trading
    volume in past periods, and may experience decreases in trading
    volume in the future. Declines in the overall volume of
    fixed-income securities trading and in market liquidity
    generally, as well as declines in interest rate volatility,
    result in lower revenues from commissions for trades executed on
    our electronic trading platform and fees generated from related
    activities.

Likewise, decreases in our share of the segments of the
    fixed-income trading markets in which we operate, or shifts in
    trading volume to segments of clients which we have not
    penetrated, could result in lower trading volume on our platform
    and, consequently, lower commissions and other revenue. During
    periods of increased volatility in credit markets, the use of
    electronic trading platforms by market participants may decrease
    dramatically as institutional investors seek to obtain
    additional information during the trade process through
    conversations with broker-dealers. In addition, during rapidly
    moving markets, broker-dealers are less likely to post prices
    electronically.

A decline in trading volumes on our platform for any reason may
    have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

We may
    enter into new fee plans, the impact of which may be difficult
    to evaluate.

We anticipate that from time to time we will introduce new fee
    plans for the U.S. high-grade corporate bond, Eurobond and
    other market segments in which we operate. Any new fee plan may
    include different fee structures or provide volume incentives.

We cannot assure you that any new fee plans will result in an
    increase in the volume of transactions effected on our platform
    or that our revenues will increase as a result of the
    implementation of any such fee plans. Furthermore, resistance to
    the new fee plans by our broker-dealer or institutional investor
    clients or a reduction in the number of dealers participating on
    our platform could have an adverse impact on our distribution
    fees and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations.



We are
    exposed to risks resulting from non-performance by
    counterparties to certain transactions executed between our
    clients in which we act as an intermediary in matching back-to
    back bond trades.

We execute certain bond transactions between and among
    institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a riskless
    principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and
    the seller in matching

back-to-back

trades, which are then settled through a third-party clearing
    organization. MarketAxess Corporation, our U.S. subsidiary,
    acts as intermediary on a riskless principal basis in these bond
    transactions by serving as counterparty to the two clients
    involved. Settlement typically occurs within one to three
    trading days after the trade date. Cash settlement of the
    transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying
    instrument that was traded.

We are exposed to credit risk in our role as trading
    counterparty to our clients executing bond trades on our
    platform. We are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe
    us money, securities or other assets will not perform their
    obligations. These parties may default on their obligations to
    us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or
    other reasons. Adverse movements in the prices of securities
    that are the subject of these transactions can increase our
    risk. Where the unmatched position or failure to deliver is
    prolonged there may also be regulatory capital charges required
    to be taken by us. The policies and procedures we use to manage
    this credit risk are new and untested. There can be no assurance
    that these policies and procedures will effectively mitigate our
    exposure to credit risk.

We are
    dependent on our broker-dealer clients, who are not restricted
    from buying and selling fixed-income securities, directly or
    through their own proprietary or third-party platforms, with
    institutional investors.

We rely on our broker-dealer clients to provide product and
    liquidity on our electronic trading platform by posting bond
    prices on our platform for bonds in their inventory and
    responding to institutional investor client inquiries. The
    contractual obligations of our broker-dealer clients to us are
    minimal, non-exclusive and terminable by such clients. Our
    broker-dealer clients buy and sell fixed-income securities
    through traditional methods, including by telephone and

e-mail

messaging, and through other electronic trading platforms. Some
    of our broker-dealer clients have developed electronic trading
    networks which compete with us or have announced their intention
    to explore the development of such electronic trading networks,
    and most of our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients
    are involved in other ventures, including other electronic
    trading platforms or other distribution channels, as trading
    participants

and/or

as
    investors. These competing trading platforms may offer some
    features that we do not currently offer. Accordingly, there can
    be no assurance that such broker-dealers’ primary
    commitments will not be to one of our competitors.

Any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by
    our broker-dealer clients would reduce the number of different
    bond issues and the volume of trading in those bond issues on
    our platform, which could, in turn, reduce the use of our
    platform by our institutional investor clients. The occurrence
    of any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on
    our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We
    derive a significant percentage of our total revenues, and an
    even greater percentage of our commissions, from broker-dealer
    clients who are also our stockholders.

We have historically earned a substantial portion of our
    commissions from broker-dealer clients that were our
    stockholders. For the year ended December 31, 2009,
    $14.1 million or 14.7% of our commissions, for the year
    ended December 31, 2008, $12.5 million or 17.0% of our
    commissions, and for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    $31.4 million or 39.2% of our commissions, were generated
    by these stockholder broker-dealer clients. None of our
    broker-dealer clients is contractually or otherwise obligated to
    continue to use our electronic trading platform. Reduced
    involvement of these broker-dealer clients due to the reduction
    in the level of their equity ownership may cause them to reduce
    or discontinue their use of our electronic trading platform and
    other services, which could negatively impact the use of our
    platform by our institutional investor clients. The loss of, or
    a significant reduction of, participation on our platform by
    these broker-dealer clients may have a material adverse effect
    on our business, financial condition and results of operations.



We
    could lose significant sources of revenue and trading volume if
    we lose any of our significant institutional investor
    clients.

We rely on our institutional investor clients to launch
    inquiries over our trading platform. A limited number of such
    clients can account for a significant portion of our trading
    volume. The contractual obligations of our institutional
    investor clients to us are minimal, non-exclusive and terminable
    by such clients. Our institutional investor clients buy and sell
    fixed-income securities through traditional methods, including
    by telephone and

e-mail

messaging, and through other electronic trading platforms.

There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our
    major institutional investor clients or that such clients will
    continue to use our trading platform. The loss of any major
    institutional investor client or any reduction in the use of our
    electronic trading platform by such clients could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

If we
    experience significant fluctuations in our operating results or
    fail to meet revenues and earnings expectations, our stock price
    may fall rapidly and without advance notice.

Due to the unpredictability of our industry and our evolving
    business model, we have and may continue to experience
    significant fluctuations in our operating results. We base our
    current and future expense levels and our investment plans on
    estimates of future revenues and future rate of growth. Our
    expenses and investments are, to a large extent, fixed and we
    expect that these expenses will increase in the future. We may
    not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our
    revenues fall short of our expectations.

Our revenues and operating results may also fluctuate due to
    other factors, including:

•

our ability to retain existing broker-dealer and institutional
    investor clients and attract new broker-dealer and institutional
    investor clients;

•

our ability to drive an increase in use of our electronic
    trading platform by new and existing broker-dealer and
    institutional investor clients;

•

changes in our pricing policies;

•

the introduction of new features on our electronic trading
    platform;

•

the effectiveness of our sales force;

•

new product and service introductions by our competitors;

•

fluctuations in overall market trading volume;

•

technical difficulties or interruptions in our service;

•

general economic conditions in our geographic markets;

•

additional investment in our services or operations; and

•

regulatory compliance costs.

As a result, our operating results may fluctuate significantly
    on a quarterly basis, which could result in decreases in our
    stock price.

We may
    not be able to introduce enhanced versions of our electronic
    trading platform, new services and/or service enhancements in a
    timely or acceptable manner, which could harm our competitive
    position.

Our business environment is characterized by rapid technological
    change, changing and increasingly sophisticated client demands
    and evolving industry standards. Our future will depend on our
    ability to develop and introduce new features to, and new
    versions of, our electronic trading platform. The success of new
    features and versions depends on several factors, including the
    timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the
    feature or version. In addition, the market for our electronic
    trading platform may be limited if prospective clients require
    customized features or functions that we are unable or unwilling
    to provide. If we are unable to anticipate



and respond to the demand for new services, products and
    technologies and develop new features and enhanced versions of
    our electronic trading platform that achieve widespread levels
    of market acceptance on a timely and cost-effective basis, it
    could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

As we
    enter new markets, we may not be able to successfully attract
    clients and adapt our technology and marketing strategy for use
    in those markets.

Our strategy includes leveraging our electronic trading platform
    to enter new markets. We cannot assure you that we will be able
    to successfully adapt our proprietary software and technology
    for use in other markets. Even if we do adapt our software and
    technology, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract
    clients and compete successfully in any such new markets. We
    cannot assure you that our marketing efforts or our pursuit of
    any of these opportunities will be successful. If these efforts
    are not successful, we may realize less than expected earnings,
    which in turn could result in a decrease in the market value of
    our common stock. Furthermore, these efforts may divert
    management attention or inefficiently utilize our resources.

Rapid
    market or technological changes may render our technology
    obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our products and
    services to our broker-dealer and institutional investor
    clients.

We must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading
    platform. The electronic financial services industry is
    characterized by significant structural changes, increasingly
    complex systems and infrastructures and new business models. If
    new industry standards and practices emerge, our existing
    technology, systems and electronic trading platform may become
    obsolete or our existing business may be harmed. Our future
    success will depend on our ability to:

•

enhance our existing products and services;

•

develop

and/or

license new products and technologies that address the
    increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our broker-dealer
    and institutional investor clients and prospective
    clients; and

•

respond to technological advances and emerging industry
    standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis.

Developing our electronic trading platform and other technology
    entails significant technical and business risks. We may use new
    technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our
    electronic trading platform, information databases and network
    infrastructure to broker-dealer or institutional investor client
    requirements or emerging industry standards. For example, our
    electronic trading platform functionality that allows searches
    and inquiries on bond pricing and availability is a critical
    part of our service, and it may become

out-of-date

or insufficient from our broker-dealer clients’ or
    institutional investor clients’ perspective and in relation
    to the inquiry functionality of our competitors’ systems.
    If we face material delays in introducing new services, products
    and enhancements, our broker-dealer and institutional investor
    clients may forego the use of our products and use those of our
    competitors.

Further, the adoption of new Internet, networking or
    telecommunications technologies may require us to devote
    substantial resources to modify and adapt our services. We
    cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement
    new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology and
    transaction-processing systems to client requirements or
    emerging industry standards. We cannot assure you that we will
    be able to respond in a timely manner to changing market
    conditions or client requirements.

We
    depend on third-party suppliers for key products and
    services.

We rely on a number of third parties to supply elements of our
    trading, information and other systems, as well as computers and
    other equipment, and related support and maintenance. We cannot
    assure you that any of these providers will be able to continue
    to provide these services in an efficient, cost-effective
    manner, if at all, or that they will be able to adequately
    expand their services to meet our needs. If we are unable to
    make alternative arrangements for the supply of critical
    products or services in the event of a malfunction of a product
    or an



interruption in or the cessation of service by an existing
    service provider, our business, financial condition and results
    of operations could be materially adversely affected.

In particular, we depend on a third-party vendor for our
    corporate bond reference database. Disruptions in the services
    provided by that third party to us, including as a result of
    their inability or unwillingness to continue to license products
    that are critical to the success of our business, could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

We also rely, and expect in the future to continue to rely, on
    third parties for various computer and communications systems,
    such as telephone companies, online service providers, data
    processors, and software and hardware vendors. Other third
    parties provide, for instance, our data center,
    telecommunications access lines and significant computer systems
    and software licensing, support and maintenance services. Any
    interruption in these or other third-party services or
    deterioration in their performance could impair the quality of
    our service. We cannot be certain of the financial viability of
    all of the third parties on which we rely.

We license software from third parties, much of which is
    integral to our electronic trading platform and our business. We
    also hire contractors to assist in the development, quality
    assurance testing and maintenance of our electronic trading
    platform and other systems. Continued access to these licensors
    and contractors on favorable contract terms or access to
    alternative software and information technology contractors is
    important to our operations. Adverse changes in any of these
    relationships could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations.

We attempt to negotiate favorable pricing, service,
    confidentiality and intellectual property ownership or licensing
    and other terms in our contracts with our service providers.
    These contracts usually have multi-year terms. However, there is
    no guarantee that these contracts will not terminate and that we
    will be able to negotiate successor agreements or agreements
    with alternate service providers on competitive terms. Further,
    the existing agreements may bind us for a period of time to
    terms and technology that become obsolete as our industry and
    our competitors advance their own operations and contracts.

Our
    success depends on maintaining the integrity of our electronic
    trading platform, systems and infrastructure; our computer
    systems may suffer failures, capacity constraints and business
    interruptions that could increase our operating costs and cause
    us to lose clients.

In order to be successful, we must provide reliable, real-time
    access to our electronic trading platform for our broker-dealer
    and institutional investor clients. If our electronic trading
    platform is hampered by slow delivery times, unreliable service
    or insufficient capacity, our broker-dealer and institutional
    investor clients may decide to stop using our platform, which
    would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

As our operations grow in both size and scope, we will need to
    improve and upgrade our electronic trading platform and
    infrastructure to accommodate potential increases in order
    message volume and trading volume, the trading practices of new
    and existing clients, regulatory changes and the development of
    new and enhanced trading platform features, functionalities and
    ancillary products and services. The expansion of our electronic
    trading platform and infrastructure has required, and will
    continue to require, substantial financial, operational and
    technical resources. These resources will typically need to be
    committed well in advance of any actual increase in trading
    volumes and order messages. We cannot assure you that our
    estimates of future trading volumes and order messages will be
    accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate
    actual trading volumes and order messages without failure or
    degradation of performance. Furthermore, we use new technologies
    to upgrade our established systems, and the development of these
    new technologies also entails technical, financial and business
    risks. We cannot assure you that we will successfully implement
    new technologies or adapt our existing electronic trading
    platform, technology and systems to the requirements of our
    broker-dealer and institutional investor clients or to emerging
    industry standards. The inability of our electronic trading
    platform to accommodate increasing trading volume and order
    messages would also constrain our ability to expand our business.



We cannot assure you that we will not experience systems
    failures. Our electronic trading platform, computer and
    communication systems and other operations are vulnerable to
    damage, interruption or failure as a result of, among other
    things:

•

irregular or heavy use of our electronic trading platform during
    peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility;

•

power or telecommunications failures, hardware failures or
    software errors;

•

human error;

•

computer viruses, acts of vandalism or sabotage (and resulting
    potential lapses in security), both internal and external;

•

natural disasters, fires, floods or other acts of God;

•

acts of war or terrorism or other armed hostility; and

•

loss of support services from third parties, including those to
    whom we outsource aspects of our computer infrastructure
    critical to our business.

In the event that any of our systems, or those of our
    third-party providers, fail or operate slowly, it may cause any
    one or more of the following to occur:

•

unanticipated disruptions in service to our clients;

•

slower response times or delays in our clients’ trade
    execution;

•

incomplete or inaccurate accounting, recording or processing of
    trades;

•

financial losses and liabilities to clients;

•

litigation or other claims against us, including formal
    complaints to industry regulatory organizations; and

•

regulatory inquiries, proceedings or sanctions.

Any system failure that causes an interruption in service or
    decreases the responsiveness of our service, including failures
    caused by client error or misuse of our systems, could damage
    our reputation, business and brand name and lead our
    broker-dealer and institutional investor clients to decrease or
    cease their use of our electronic trading platform.

In these circumstances, our redundant systems or disaster
    recovery plans may not be adequate. Similarly, although many of
    our contracts with our service providers require them to have
    disaster recovery plans, we cannot be certain that these will be
    adequate or implemented properly. In addition, our business
    interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for
    losses that may occur.

We also cannot assure you that we have sufficient personnel to
    properly respond to system problems. We internally support and
    maintain many of our computer systems and networks, including
    those underlying our electronic trading platform. Our failure to
    monitor or maintain these systems and networks or, if necessary,
    to find a replacement for this technology in a timely and
    cost-effective manner would have a material adverse effect on
    our business, financial condition and results of operations.

If our
    security measures are breached and unauthorized access is
    obtained to our electronic trading platform, broker-dealers and
    institutional investors may become hesitant to use, or reduce or
    stop their use of, our trading platform.

Our electronic trading platform involves the storage and
    transmission of our clients’ proprietary information. The
    secure storage and transmission of confidential information over
    public networks is a critical element of our operations.
    Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this
    information, litigation and possible liability. If our security
    measures are breached as a result of third-party action,
    employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and, as a result,
    someone obtains unauthorized access to trading or other
    confidential information, our reputation could be damaged, our
    business may suffer and we could incur significant liability.
    Because techniques used to obtain



unauthorized access or to sabotage computer systems change
    frequently and generally are not recognized until launched
    against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these
    techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. If an
    actual, threatened or perceived breach of our security occurs,
    the market perception of the effectiveness of our security
    measures could be harmed and could cause our broker-dealer and
    institutional investor clients to reduce or stop their use of
    our electronic trading platform. We may be required to expend
    significant resources to protect against the threat of security
    breaches or to alleviate problems, including reputational harm
    and litigation, caused by any breaches. Although we intend to
    continue to implement industry-standard security measures, we
    cannot assure you that those measures will be sufficient.

We may
    not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or
    technology effectively, which would allow competitors to
    duplicate or replicate our electronic trading platform. This
    could adversely affect our ability to compete.

Intellectual property is critical to our success and ability to
    compete, and if we fail to protect our intellectual property
    rights adequately, our competitors might gain access to our
    technology. We rely primarily on a combination of patent,
    copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States
    and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements,
    third-party non-disclosure and other agreements and other
    contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our
    intellectual property rights. We attempt to negotiate beneficial
    intellectual property ownership provisions in our contracts and
    also require employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators
    to enter into confidentiality agreements in order to protect the
    confidentiality of our proprietary information. We have received
    five patents and have filed patent applications covering aspects
    of our technology

and/or

business, but can make no assurances that any such patents will
    protect our business and processes from competition or that the
    patents applied for will be issued. Additionally, laws and our
    contractual terms may not be sufficient to protect our
    technology from use or theft by third parties. For instance, a
    third party might reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use
    our technology without our permission and without our knowledge,
    thereby infringing our rights and allowing competitors to
    duplicate or replicate our products. Furthermore, we cannot
    assure you that these protections will be adequate to prevent
    our competitors from independently developing technologies that
    are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology.

We may have legal or contractual rights that we could assert
    against illegal use of our intellectual property rights, but
    lawsuits claiming infringement or misappropriation are complex
    and expensive, and the outcome would not be certain. In
    addition, the laws of some countries in which we now or in the
    future provide our services may not protect software and
    intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of
    the United States.

Defending
    against intellectual property infringement or other claims could
    be expensive and disruptive to our business. If we are found to
    infringe the proprietary rights of others, we could be required
    to redesign our products, pay royalties or enter into license
    agreements with third parties.

In the technology industry, there is frequent litigation based
    on allegations of infringement or other violations of
    intellectual property rights. As the number of participants in
    our market increases and the number of patents and other
    intellectual property registrations increases, the possibility
    of an intellectual property claim against us grows. Although we
    have never been the subject of a material intellectual property
    dispute, we cannot assure you that a third party will not assert
    in the future that our technology or the manner in which we
    operate our business violates its intellectual property rights.
    From time to time, in the ordinary course of our business, we
    may become subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to
    the intellectual property rights of others, and we expect that
    third parties may assert intellectual property claims against
    us, particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our
    business, the number of electronic trading platforms increases
    and the functionality of these platforms further overlaps. Any
    claims, whether with or without merit, could:

•

be expensive and time-consuming to defend;

•

prevent us from operating our business, or portions of our
    business;

•

cause us to cease developing, licensing or using all or any part
    of our electronic trading platform that incorporates the
    challenged intellectual property;



•

require us to redesign our products or services, which may not
    be feasible;

•

result in significant monetary liability;

•

divert management’s attention and resources; and

•

require us to pay royalties or enter into licensing agreements
    in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies,
    which may not be possible on commercially reasonable terms.

We cannot assure you that third parties will not assert
    infringement claims against us in the future with respect to our
    electronic trading platform or any of our other current or
    future products or services or that any such assertion will not
    require us to cease providing such services or products, try to
    redesign our products or services, enter into royalty
    arrangements, if available, or engage in litigation that could
    be costly to us. Any of these events could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

If we
    acquire or invest in other businesses, products or technologies,
    we may be unable to integrate them with our business, our
    financial performance may be impaired or we may not realize the
    anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such
    transactions.

If appropriate opportunities present themselves, we may acquire
    or make investments in businesses, products or technologies that
    we believe are strategic. We may not be able to identify,
    negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment
    successfully. Even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in
    a business, product or technology, such acquisitions and
    investments involve a number of risks, including:

•

we may find that the acquired company or assets do not further
    our business strategy, or that we overpaid for the company or
    assets, or the economic conditions underlying our acquisition
    decision may change;

•

we may have difficulty integrating the acquired technologies or
    products with our existing electronic trading platform, products
    and services;

•

we may have difficulty integrating the operations and personnel
    of the acquired business, or retaining the key personnel of the
    acquired business;

•

there may be client confusion if our services overlap with those
    of the acquired company;

•

our ongoing business and management’s attention may be
    disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and
    the complexity of managing geographically or culturally diverse
    enterprises;

•

we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards, controls,
    procedures and policies across locations;

•

an acquisition may result in litigation from terminated
    employees or third parties; and

•

we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated
    with product quality, technology and legal contingencies.

These factors could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or
    multiple acquisitions in a short period of time. From time to
    time, we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or
    investments that are not ultimately consummated. Such
    negotiations could result in significant diversion of management
    time, as well as

out-of-pocket

costs.

The consideration paid in connection with an investment or
    acquisition also affects our financial results. If we were to
    proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the
    consideration included cash, we could be required to use a
    substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any
    acquisition. To the extent we issue shares of capital stock or
    other rights to purchase capital stock, including options or
    other rights, existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings
    per share may decrease. In addition, acquisitions may result in
    the incurrence of debt, large one-time write-offs, such as of
    acquired in-process research and development costs, and
    restructuring charges. They may also result in goodwill and
    other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests,
    which could result in future impairment charges as was the case
    in 2008 with the write-down of certain TWS-related intangible
    assets.



We may
    be limited in our use of our U.S. net operating loss
    carryforwards.

As of December 31, 2009, we had U.S. net operating
    loss carryforwards of approximately $82.4 million that will
    begin to expire in 2019. A net operating loss carryforward
    enables a company to apply net operating losses incurred during
    a current period against future periods’ profits in order
    to reduce tax liability in those future periods.

Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that when
    a company undergoes an “ownership change,” that
    company’s use of its net operating losses is limited
    annually in each subsequent year. An “ownership
    change” occurs when, as of any testing date, the sum of the
    increases in ownership of each shareholder that owns five
    percent or more of the value of a company’s stock as
    compared to that shareholder’s lowest percentage ownership
    during the preceding three-year period exceeds
    50 percentage points. For purposes of this rule, certain
    shareholders who own less than five percent of a company’s
    stock are aggregated and treated as a single five-percent
    shareholder.

The issuance or repurchase of a significant number of shares of
    stock or purchases or sales of stock by significant shareholders
    could result in an additional “ownership change.” For,
    example, we may issue a substantial number of shares of our
    stock in connection with offerings, acquisitions and other
    transactions in the future and we could repurchase a significant
    number of shares in connection with a stock repurchase program,
    although no assurance can be given that any such offering,
    acquisition, other transaction or repurchase program will be
    undertaken. In addition, the exercise of outstanding options to
    purchase shares of our common stock may require us to issue
    additional shares of our common stock. The extent of the actual
    future use of our U.S. net operating loss carryforwards is
    subject to inherent uncertainty because it depends on the amount
    of otherwise taxable income we may earn. We cannot give any
    assurance that we will have sufficient taxable income in future
    years to use any of our federal net operating loss carryforwards
    before they would otherwise expire.

We are
    dependent on our management team, and the loss of any key member
    of this team may prevent us from implementing our business plan
    in a timely manner.

Our success depends largely upon the continued services of our
    executive officers and other key personnel, particularly Richard
    M. McVey, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of
    Directors. The terms of Mr. McVey’s employment
    agreement with us do not require him to continue to work for us
    and allow him to terminate his employment at any time, subject
    to certain notice requirements and forfeiture of non-vested
    equity options, performance shares and restricted stock. Any
    loss or interruption of Mr. McVey’s services or that
    of one or more of our other executive officers or key personnel
    could result in our inability to manage our operations
    effectively

and/or

pursue our business strategy.

Because
    competition for our employees is intense, we may not be able to
    attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to
    support our business.

We strive to provide high-quality services that will allow us to
    establish and maintain long-term relationships with our
    broker-dealer and institutional investor clients. Our ability to
    provide these services and maintain these relationships, as well
    as our ability to execute our business plan generally, depends
    in large part upon our employees. We must attract and retain
    highly qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel is
    intense, especially for software engineers with extensive
    experience in designing and developing software and
    Internet-related services, hardware engineers, technicians,
    product managers and senior sales executives.

The market for qualified personnel is increasingly competitive
    as the financial industry continues to recover and as electronic
    commerce continues to experience growth. Many of the companies
    with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater
    resources than we have and are longer established in the
    marketplace. In addition, in making employment decisions,
    particularly in the Internet, high-technology and financial
    services industries, job candidates often consider the total
    compensation package offered, including the value of the
    stock-based compensation they are to receive in connection with
    their employment. Significant volatility in the price of our
    common stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or
    retain key employees. The expensing of stock-based compensation
    may discourage us from granting the size or type of stock-based
    compensation that job candidates may require to join our company.



We cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts
    to recruit and retain the required personnel. The failure to
    attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current
    personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

Termination
    of employees may result in additional costs

We are currently involved in an arbitration case filed by a
    former employee. We believe that the claims are without merit
    and we intend to vigorously defend against them. However, an
    adverse settlement or judgment related to these or similar types
    of claims may have an adverse effect on our financial condition
    or results of operations. Regardless of the outcome of this
    case, we may incur significant expense and management time
    dealing with these and other such claims. In addition, we have
    paid severance amounts in connection with the involuntary
    termination of employees in the past and may offer severance
    packages in connection with future involuntary terminations, if
    any.

Our
    business is subject to increasingly extensive government and
    other regulation and our relationships with our broker-dealer
    clients may subject us to increasing regulatory
    scrutiny.

The financial industry is extensively regulated by many
    governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations,
    including the SEC and FINRA. As a matter of public policy, these
    regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding the integrity
    of the securities and other financial markets and protecting the
    interests of investors in those markets. These regulatory bodies
    have broad powers to promulgate and interpret, investigate and
    sanction non-compliance with their laws, rules and regulations.

Most aspects of our broker-dealer subsidiaries are highly
    regulated, including:

•

the way we deal with our clients;

•

our capital requirements;

•

our financial and regulatory reporting practices;

•

required record-keeping and record retention procedures;

•

the licensing of our employees; and

•

the conduct of our directors, officers, employees and affiliates.

We cannot assure you that we

and/or

our
    directors, officers and employees will be able to fully comply
    with these laws, rules and regulations. If we fail to comply
    with any of these laws, rules or regulations, we may be subject
    to censure, fines,

cease-and-desist

orders, suspension of our business, suspensions of personnel or
    other sanctions, including revocation of our membership in FINRA
    and registration as a broker-dealer.

We have two major operating subsidiaries, MarketAxess
    Corporation and MarketAxess Europe Limited. MarketAxess
    Corporation and MarketAxess Europe Limited are subject to
    U.S. and U.K. regulations as a registered broker-dealer and
    as a multilateral trading facility, respectively, which prohibit
    repayment of borrowings from the Company or affiliates, paying
    cash dividends, making loans to the Company or affiliates or
    otherwise entering into transactions that result in a
    significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial
    resources, without prior notification to or approval from such
    subsidiary’s principal regulator.

In addition, as a result of the global financial crisis and
    other recent events in the financial industry, there is a
    greater likelihood of legislative and regulatory action to
    increase government oversight of the financial services
    industry. Changes in laws or regulations or in governmental
    policies, including the rules relating to the maintenance of
    specific levels of net capital applicable to our broker-dealer
    subsidiaries, could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations. Our
    industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory
    changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in
    the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations, which
    could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause
    the development of affected markets to become impractical. In
    addition, as we expand our business into new markets, it is
    likely that we will be subject to additional laws, rules and
    regulations. We cannot predict the extent to which any future
    regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and
    operations.



Our disclosed trading system has not been subjected to
    regulation as an alternative trading system under
    Regulation ATS. A determination by the SEC to treat our
    trading platform as an alternative trading system subject to
    Regulation ATS would subject us to additional reporting
    obligations and other limitations on the conduct of our
    business, many of which could be material. Our anonymous

dealer-to-dealer

trading service,
    DealerAxess

®

,

    is regulated as an alternative trading system subject to
    Regulation ATS.

As an enterprise founded and historically controlled by
    broker-dealer that compete with each other, we may be subject to
    ongoing regulatory scrutiny of our business to a degree that is
    not likely to be experienced by some of our competitors. At any
    time, the outcome of investigations and other regulatory
    scrutiny could lead to compulsory changes to our business model,
    conduct or practices, or our relationships with our
    broker-dealer clients, or additional governmental scrutiny or
    private lawsuits against us, any of which could materially harm
    our revenues, impair our ability to provide access to the
    broadest range of fixed-income securities and impact our ability
    to grow and compete effectively, particularly as we implement
    new initiatives designed to enhance our competitive position.

The activities and consequences described above may result in
    significant distractions to our management and could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

We
    expect to continue to expand our operations outside of the
    United States; however, we may face special economic and
    regulatory challenges that we may not be able to
    meet.

We operate an electronic trading platform in Europe and we plan
    to further expand our operations throughout Europe and other
    regions. There are certain risks inherent in doing business in
    international markets, particularly in the financial services
    industry, which is heavily regulated in many jurisdictions.
    These risks include:

•

less developed technological infrastructures and generally
    higher costs, which could result in lower client acceptance of
    our services or clients having difficulty accessing our trading
    platform;

•

difficulty in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals for
    planned expansion, if at all, and the possibility that any
    approvals that are obtained may impose restrictions on the
    operation of our business;

•

the inability to manage and coordinate the various regulatory
    requirements of multiple jurisdictions that are constantly
    evolving and subject to unexpected change;

•

difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;

•

fluctuations in exchange rates;

•

reduced or no protection for intellectual property rights;

•

seasonal reductions in business activity; and

•

potentially adverse tax consequences.

Our inability to manage these risks effectively could adversely
    affect our business and limit our ability to expand our
    international operations, which could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

We
    cannot predict our future capital needs or our ability to obtain
    additional financing if we need it.

Our business is dependent upon the availability of adequate
    funding and regulatory capital under applicable regulatory
    requirements. Although we believe that our available cash
    resources are sufficient to meet our presently anticipated
    liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at
    least the next 12 months, we may in the future need to
    raise additional funds to, among other things:

•

support more rapid growth of our business;

•

develop new or enhanced services and products;

•

fund operating losses;

•

respond to competitive pressures;



•

acquire complementary companies or technologies;

•

enter into strategic alliances;

•

increase the regulatory net capital necessary to support our
    operations; or

•

respond to unanticipated capital requirements.

We may not be able to obtain additional financing, if needed, in
    amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If sufficient
    funds are not available or are not available on terms acceptable
    to us, our ability to fund our expansion, take advantage of
    acquisition opportunities, develop or enhance our services or
    products, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be
    significantly limited. These limitations could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

We are
    subject to the risks of litigation and securities laws
    liability.

Many aspects of our business, and the businesses of our clients,
    involve substantial risks of liability. Dissatisfied clients may
    make claims regarding quality of trade execution, improperly
    settled trades, mismanagement or even fraud against their
    service providers. We and our clients may become subject to
    these claims as the result of failures or malfunctions of our
    electronic trading platform and services provided by us. We
    could incur significant legal expenses defending claims, even
    those without merit. An adverse resolution of any lawsuits or
    claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations.

Risks
    Related to Our Industry

If the
    use of electronic trading platforms does not increase, we may
    not be able to achieve our business objectives.

The success of our business plan depends in part on our ability
    to create an electronic trading platform for a wide range of
    fixed-income products. Historically, fixed-income securities
    markets operated through telephone communications between
    institutional investors and broker-dealers. The utilization of
    our products and services depends on the acceptance, adoption
    and growth of electronic means of trading securities. We cannot
    assure you that the growth and acceptance of electronic means of
    trading securities will continue.

Economic,
    political and market factors beyond our control could reduce
    demand for our services and harm our business, and our
    profitability could suffer.

The global financial services business is, by its nature, risky
    and volatile and is directly affected by many national and
    international factors that are beyond our control. Any one of
    these factors may cause a substantial decline in the

U.S. and/or

global financial services markets, resulting in reduced trading
    volume. These events could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations. These
    factors include:

•

economic and political conditions in the United States and
    elsewhere;

•

adverse market conditions, including unforeseen market closures
    or other disruptions in trading;

•

consolidation or contraction in the number of broker-dealers;

•

actual or threatened acts of war or terrorism or other armed
    hostilities;

•

concerns over inflation and weakening consumer confidence levels;

•

the availability of cash for investment by mutual funds and
    other wholesale and retail investors;

•

the level and volatility of interest and foreign currency
    exchange rates; and

•

legislative and regulatory changes.



Any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced
    activity and prices in the securities markets generally. Our
    revenues and profitability are likely to decline significantly
    during periods of stagnant economic conditions or low trading
    volume in the U.S. and global financial markets.

Risks
    Related to Our Common Stock

Market
    volatility may cause our stock price and the value of your
    investment to decline.

The market price of our common stock may be significantly
    affected by volatility in the markets in general. The market
    price of our common stock likely will continue to fluctuate in
    response to factors including the following:

•

the other risk factors described in this annual report on

Form 10-K;

•

prevailing interest rates;

•

the market for similar securities;

•

additional issuances of common stock;

•

general economic conditions; and

•

our financial condition, performance and prospects, including
    our ability or inability to meet analyst expectations.

Most of these factors are beyond our control. In addition, the
    stock markets in general, including the NASDAQ Global Select
    Market, have experienced and continue to experience significant
    price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations have resulted
    in volatility in the market prices of securities for companies
    such as ours that often has been unrelated or disproportionate
    to changes in the operating performance of the affected
    companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may
    affect adversely the market price of our common stock regardless
    of our operating performance.

We may
    not pay dividends on our common stock in the
    future.

We initiated a dividend on our common stock in 2009. However,
    there is no assurance that we will continue to pay any dividends
    to holders of our common stock in the future. If we were to
    cease paying dividends, investors would need to rely on the sale
    of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never
    occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their
    investment.

If
    securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our
    business or if they downgrade our common stock, the price of our
    common stock could decline.

The trading market for our common stock relies in part on the
    research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish
    about us or our business. These analysts work independently of
    us. If one or more analysts who cover us downgrade our stock,
    our stock price could decline rapidly. If one or more of these
    analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility
    in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to
    decline.

Provisions
    in our stockholders rights plan, organizational documents and
    Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of
    control of our company or changes in our management, and
    therefore, depress the trading price of our common
    stock.

Our Board of Directors adopted and our stockholders subsequently
    ratified a stockholders rights plan, commonly referred to as a
    “poison pill.” This plan entitles existing
    stockholders to rights, including the right to purchase shares
    of common stock, in the event of an acquisition of 20% or more
    of our outstanding common stock. Our stockholders rights plan
    could prevent stockholders from profiting from an increase in
    the market value of their shares as a result of a change of
    control of us by delaying or preventing a change of control.



In addition, provisions of our certificate of incorporation and
    bylaws may make it substantially more difficult for a third
    party to acquire control of us and may prevent changes in our
    management, including provisions that:

•

prevent stockholders from calling special meetings;

•

allow the directors to amend the bylaws without stockholder
    approval; and

•

set forth advance notice procedures for nominating directors and
    submitting proposals for consideration at stockholders’
    meetings.

Provisions of Delaware law may also inhibit potential
    acquisition bids for us or prevent us from engaging in business
    combinations. In addition, we have severance agreements with
    several employees and a change of control severance plan that
    could require an acquiror to pay a higher price. Either
    collectively or individually, these provisions may prevent
    holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they may
    believe are the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers,
    including the potential realization of a higher rate of return
    on their investment from these types of transactions.

Properties.

Beginning February 2010, our corporate headquarters and
    principal U.S. offices are located at 299 Park Avenue, New
    York, New York, where we lease 27,900 square feet under
    sequential leases expiring in February 2022. We also
    collectively lease approximately 18,300 square feet for our
    other office locations in the U.S. and the United Kingdom
    under various leases expiring between May 2010 and March 2019.
    In addition, we lease another 17,000 square feet at 350
    Madison Avenue, New York, New York, which we currently sublet;
    the lease and sublease expire in April 2011.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings.

In January 2007, a former employee of MarketAxess Corporation
    commenced an arbitration proceeding before FINRA arising out of
    the May 2006 termination of such individual’s employment
    with MarketAxess Corporation. This individual subsequently
    amended his statement of claim to add MarketAxess Holdings Inc.
    as a party to the arbitration proceeding. FINRA consolidated all
    of the former employee’s claims into a single proceeding.
    The former employee alleges that we acted wrongfully as a result
    of, and in connection with, the decision by the Compensation
    Committee of our Board of Directors not to accede to the
    employee’s demand for alteration of the terms of certain
    stock option and restricted stock agreements in order to award
    the employee additional rights and benefits upon the termination
    of his employment,

i.e.

, accelerated vesting of all of
    his then unvested options and shares of restricted stock and
    waiver of the

90-day

time
    period within which he was contractually required to exercise
    his vested options. This former employee further alleges that he
    is entitled to a bonus for the approximately five months that he
    worked for MarketAxess Corporation during 2006. The alleged
    damages sought by the claimant total approximately
    $0.9 million, plus statutory interest, and an unstated
    amount of punitive damages, costs and expenses.

The FINRA hearing, originally scheduled for early February 2009,
    was further postponed in September 2009 and February 2010. New
    hearing dates have not yet been established. We believe that
    these claims are wholly without merit and have vigorously
    defended against them. Based on currently available information,
    we believe that the likelihood of a material loss is not
    probable. Accordingly, no amount has been provided in the
    financial statements. However, arbitration is subject to
    inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur.

Dividend
    Policy

Prior to 2009, we retained all earnings for investment in our
    business. In October 2009, our Board of Directors approved a
    regular quarterly dividend. The first quarterly cash dividend of
    $0.07 per share was paid to our stockholders in November 2009
    and a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share will be paid on
    March 3, 2010 to stockholders of record as of the close of
    business on February 17, 2010. We expect to continue paying
    regular cash dividends, although there is no assurance as to
    such dividends. Any future declaration and payment of dividends
    will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. Our
    Board of Directors may take into account such matters as general
    business conditions, our financial results, capital
    requirements, contractual, legal, and regulatory restrictions on
    the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our
    subsidiaries to us and any such other factors as our Board of
    Directors may deem relevant.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

You should read the following discussion and analysis of our
    financial condition and results of operations in conjunction
    with “Selected Financial Data” and our consolidated
    financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in
    this

Form 10-K.

In addition to historical information, this discussion and
    analysis contains forward-looking statements relating to future
    events and the future performance of MarketAxess that are based
    on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates and
    projections about us and our industry. These forward-looking
    statements involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results
    and timing of various events could differ materially from those
    anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of a
    variety of factors, as more fully described in this section, in
    “Item 1A. — Risk Factors” and elsewhere
    in this

Form 10-K.

We undertake no obligation to update publicly any
    forward-looking statements for any reason, even if new
    information becomes available or other events occur in the
    future.

Executive
    Summary

MarketAxess operates a leading electronic trading platform that
    allows investment industry professionals to efficiently trade
    corporate bonds and other types of fixed-income instruments. Our
    730 active institutional investor clients (firms that executed
    at least one trade in U.S. or European fixed-income
    securities through our electronic trading platform during
    2009) include investment advisers, mutual funds, insurance
    companies, public and private pension funds, bank portfolios,
    broker-dealers and hedge funds. Our 67 broker-dealer
    market-maker clients provide liquidity on the platform and
    include most of the leading broker-dealers in global
    fixed-income trading. Our
    DealerAxess

®

trading service allows dealers to trade fixed-income securities
    and credit default swaps with each other on our platform.
    Through our Corporate
    BondTicker

tm

service, we provide fixed-income market data, analytics and
    compliance tools that help our clients make trading decisions.
    In addition, we provide FIX (Financial Information eXchange)
    message management tools, connectivity solutions and ancillary
    technology services that facilitate the electronic communication
    of order information between trading counterparties. Our
    revenues are primarily generated from the trading of
    U.S. and European high-grade corporate bonds.

Our multi-dealer trading platform allows our institutional
    investor clients to simultaneously request competing, executable
    bids or offers from our broker-dealer clients and execute trades
    with the broker-dealer of their choice from among those that
    choose to respond. We offer our broker-dealer clients a solution
    that enables them to efficiently reach our institutional
    investor clients for the distribution and trading of bonds. In
    addition to U.S. high-grade corporate bonds, European
    high-grade corporate bonds and emerging markets bonds, including
    both investment-grade and non-investment grade debt, we also
    offer our clients the ability to trade crossover and high-yield
    bonds, agency bonds and credit default swap indices.

The majority of our revenues are derived from monthly
    distribution fees and commissions for trades executed on our
    platform that are billed to our broker-dealer clients on a
    monthly basis. We also derive revenues from technology products
    and services, information and user access fees, investment
    income and other income. Our expenses consist of employee
    compensation and benefits, depreciation and amortization,
    technology and communication expenses, professional and
    consulting fees, occupancy, marketing and advertising and other
    general and administrative expenses.

Our objective is to provide the leading global electronic
    trading platform for fixed-income securities, connecting
    broker-dealers and institutional investors more easily and
    efficiently, while offering a broad array of information,
    trading and technology services to market participants across
    the trading cycle. The key elements of our strategy are:

•

to innovate and efficiently add new functionality and product
    offerings to the MarketAxess platform that we believe will help
    to increase our market share with existing clients, as well as
    expand our client base;

•

to leverage our technology, as well as our strong broker-dealer
    and institutional investor relationships, to deploy our
    electronic trading platform into additional product segments
    within the fixed-income securities markets, deliver fixed-income
    securities-related technical services and products and deploy
    our electronic trading platform into new client segments;



•

to continue building our existing service offerings so that our
    electronic trading platform is fully integrated into the
    workflow of our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients
    and to continue to add functionality to allow our clients to
    achieve a fully automated

end-to-end

straight-through processing solution (automation from trade
    initiation to settlement);

•

to add new content and analytical capabilities to Corporate
    BondTicker

tm

in order to improve the value of the information we provide to
    our clients; and

•

to continue to supplement our internal growth by entering into
    strategic alliances, or acquiring businesses or technologies
    that will enable us to enter new markets, provide new products
    or services, or otherwise enhance the value of our platform to
    our clients.

Critical
    Factors Affecting Our Industry and Our Company

Economic,
    Political and Market Factors

The global fixed-income securities industry is risky and
    volatile and is directly affected by a number of economic,
    political and market factors that may result in declining
    trading volume. These factors could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations. These factors include, among others, credit market
    conditions, the current interest rate environment, including the
    volatility of interest rates and investors’ forecasts of
    future interest rates, economic and political conditions in the
    United States, Europe and elsewhere, and consolidation or
    contraction of broker-dealers.

Competitive
    Landscape

The global fixed-income securities industry generally, and the
    electronic financial services markets in which we engage in
    particular, are highly competitive, and we expect competition to
    intensify in the future. Sources of competition for us will
    continue to include, among others, bond trading conducted
    directly between broker-dealers and their institutional investor
    clients over the telephone or electronically and other
    multi-dealer trading companies. Competitors, including companies
    in which some of our broker-dealer clients have invested, have
    developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their
    intention to explore the development of electronic platforms
    that may compete with us.

In general, we compete on the basis of a number of key factors,
    including, among others, the liquidity provided on our platform,
    the magnitude and frequency of price improvement enabled by our
    platform and the quality and speed of execution. We believe that
    we compete favorably with respect to these factors. We continue
    to proactively build technology solutions that serve the needs
    of the credit markets.

Our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and
    integration of our broker-dealer and institutional investor
    clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems.
    We have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we
    serve in the development of our platform, working closely with
    our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs.

Regulatory
    Environment

Our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory
    changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in
    the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations, which
    could require us to incur significant costs.

Our U.S. subsidiary, MarketAxess Corporation, is a
    registered broker-dealer with the SEC and is a member of FINRA.
    Our U.K. subsidiary, MarketAxess Europe Limited, is registered
    as a multilateral trading facility dealer with the FSA in the
    U.K. MarketAxess Canada Limited, a Canadian subsidiary, is
    registered as an Alternative Trading System dealer under the
    Securities Act of Ontario and is a member of the Investment
    Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada. Relevant regulations
    prohibit repayment of borrowings from these subsidiaries or
    their affiliates, paying cash dividends, making loans to us or
    our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that
    result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or
    financial resources, without prior notification to or approval
    from such regulated entity’s principal regulator.



As a public company listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market,
    we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and NASDAQ
    rules. The requirements of these rules and regulations impose
    legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more
    difficult, time-consuming

and/or

costly and may also place a strain on our systems and resources.
    In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our
    disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
    financial reporting, significant resources and management
    oversight are required.

Rapid
    Technological Changes

We must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading
    platform. The electronic financial services industry is
    characterized by increasingly complex systems and
    infrastructures and new business models. Our future success will
    depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and
    services, develop

and/or

license new products and technologies that address the
    increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our broker-dealer
    and institutional investor clients and prospective clients and
    respond to technological advances and emerging industry
    standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis. We
    received five patents in 2009 covering our most significant
    trading protocols and other aspects of our trading system
    technology, and other patents are pending.

Trends in
    Our Business

The majority of our revenues are derived from monthly
    distribution fees and commissions for transactions executed on
    our platform between our institutional investor and
    broker-dealer clients. We believe that there are five key
    variables that impact the notional value of such transactions on
    our platform and the amount of commissions and distribution fees
    earned by us:

•

the number of institutional investor clients that participate on
    the platform and their willingness to originate transactions
    through the platform;

•

the number of broker-dealer clients on the platform and the
    frequency and competitiveness of the price responses they
    provide to the institutional investor clients;

•

the number of markets for which we make trading available to our
    clients;

•

the overall level of activity in these markets; and

•

the level of commissions that we collect for trades executed
    through the platform.

We believe that overall corporate bond market trading volume is
    affected by various factors including the absolute levels of
    interest rates, the direction of interest rate movements, the
    level of new issues of corporate bonds and the volatility of
    corporate bond spreads versus U.S. Treasury securities.
    Because a significant percentage of our revenue is tied directly
    to the volume of securities traded on our platform, it is likely
    that a general decline in trading volumes, regardless of the
    cause of such decline, would reduce our revenues and have a
    significant negative impact on profitability.

The U.S. and European credit markets have been through a
    period of significant turmoil since the third quarter of 2007,
    especially in short-term funding and floating rate note
    instruments. A widespread retrenchment in the credit markets
    resulted in increased credit spreads and significantly higher
    credit spread volatility across a wide range of asset classes.
    Credit yield spreads in U.S. corporate bonds, as measured
    by the Credit Suisse Liquid U.S. Corporate Index, increased
    from 1.0% over U.S. Treasuries in June 2007 to a peak of
    5.4% in December 2008. The credit markets demonstrated
    significant improvement throughout 2009, with net inflows to
    taxable bond funds and corporate and international bond
    exchange-traded funds, and an increase in the volume of new
    issues of high-grade corporate bonds compared to the second half
    of 2008. Credit yield spreads in U.S. corporate bonds
    declined to 1.2% over U.S. Treasuries as of
    December 31, 2009. The average daily trading volume of
    U.S. high-grade corporate bonds for the quarter ended
    December 31, 2009, as measured by the FINRA Trade Reporting
    and Compliance Engine (“TRACE”), was
    $11.0 billion, compared to $8.0 billion in the quarter
    ended December 31, 2008.



Commission
    Revenue

Commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the
    notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platform and vary
    based on the type, size, yield and maturity of the bond traded.
    The commission rates are based on a number of factors, including
    fees charged by inter-dealer brokers in the respective markets,
    average bid-offer spreads in the products we offer and
    transaction costs through alternative channels including the
    telephone. Under our transaction fee plans, bonds that are more
    actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally
    charged lower commissions, while bonds that are less actively
    traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher
    commissions.

U.S. High-Grade Corporate Bond
    Commissions.

Our U.S. high-grade corporate
    bond fee plans for fully electronic trades generally incorporate
    various monthly distribution fees and variable transaction fees
    billed to our broker-dealer clients on a monthly basis. The fee
    plans generally incorporate volume incentives to our
    broker-dealer clients that are designed to increase the volume
    of transactions effected on our platform. Under the fee plans,
    we electronically add the transaction fee to the spread quoted
    by the broker-dealer client. For trades that we execute between
    and among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a
    riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the
    buyer and the seller, we earn our commission through the
    difference in price between the two

back-to-back

trades.

Eurobond Commissions.

On June 1, 2007, we
    introduced a new fee plan for Eurobond trades for the majority
    of our European dealers. Similar to the U.S. high-grade
    plans, our European fee plan incorporates monthly distribution
    fees as well as variable transaction fees. The variable
    transaction fee under the new plan is dependent on the type of
    bond traded and the maturity of the issue. The combination of
    the distribution fees and transaction fees in the new plan
    results in higher total revenue to us at current or lower volume
    levels. If volume grows, total revenues could be less under the
    new plan than the previous plan due to the lower transaction
    fees. Under the fee plan in effect prior to June 1, 2007,
    broker-dealer transaction fees varied based on the type of bond
    traded and the maturity of the issue. This fee schedule applied
    a tiered fee structure, which reduced the fee per trade upon the
    attainment of certain specified amounts of monthly commissions
    generated by a particular broker-dealer and did not carry a
    monthly distribution fee.

Other Commissions.

Commissions for other bond
    and credit default swap trades generally vary based on the type
    and the maturity of the instrument traded. We generally operate
    using standard fee schedules that may include both transaction
    fees and monthly distribution fees that are charged to the
    participating dealers. For trades that we execute between and
    among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a
    riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the
    buyer and the seller, we earn our commission through the
    difference in price between the two

back-to-back

trades.

We anticipate that average fees per million may change in the
    future. Consequently, past trends in commissions are not
    necessarily indicative of future commissions.

Other
    Revenue

In addition to the commissions discussed above, we earn revenue
    from technology products and services, information services fees
    paid by institutional investor and broker-dealer clients, income
    on investments and other income.

Technology Products and Services.

Technology
    products and services includes software licenses, maintenance
    and support services and professional consulting services, In
    March 2008, we acquired Greenline Financial Technologies, Inc.
    (“Greenline”), an Illinois-based provider of
    integration, testing and management solutions for FIX-related
    products and services. In November 2007, we acquired certain
    assets of Trade West Systems, LLC (“TWS”), a
    Utah-based financial software and technology services provider
    focused on providing gateway adapters for connecting order
    management systems and trading systems to fixed-income trading
    venues.

Information and User Access Fees.

We charge
    information services fees for Corporate
    BondTicker

tm

to our broker-dealer clients, institutional investor clients and
    data-only subscribers. The information services fee is a flat
    monthly fee, based on the level of service. We also generate
    information services fees from the sale of bulk data to certain
    institutional investor clients and data-only subscribers.
    Institutional investor clients trading U.S. high-grade



corporate bonds are charged a monthly user access fee for the
    use of our platform. The fee, billed quarterly, is charged to
    the client based on the number of the client’s users. To
    encourage institutional investor clients to execute trades on
    our platform, we reduce these information and user access fees
    for such clients once minimum quarterly trading volumes are
    attained.

Investment Income.

Investment income consists
    of income earned on our investments.

Other.

Other revenues include fees from
    telecommunications line charges to broker-dealer clients,
    initial

set-up

fees
    and other miscellaneous revenues.

Expenses

In the normal course of business, we incur the following
    expenses:

Employee Compensation and Benefits.

Employee
    compensation and benefits is our most significant expense and
    includes employee salaries, stock compensation costs, other
    incentive compensation, employee benefits and payroll taxes.

Depreciation and Amortization.

We depreciate
    our computer hardware and related software, office hardware and
    furniture and fixtures and amortize our capitalized software
    development costs on a straight-line basis over three to seven
    years. We amortize leasehold improvements on a straight-line
    basis over the lesser of the life of the improvement or the
    remaining term of the lease. Intangible assets with definite
    lives, including purchased technologies, customer relationships
    and other intangible assets, are amortized over their estimated
    useful lives, ranging from five to ten years. Intangible assets
    are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances
    indicate a possible impairment.

Technology and Communications.

Technology and
    communications expense consists primarily of costs relating to
    maintenance on software and hardware, our internal network
    connections, data center hosting costs and data feeds provided
    by outside vendors or service providers. The majority of our
    broker-dealer clients have dedicated high-speed communication
    lines to our network in order to provide fast data transfer. We
    charge our broker-dealer clients a monthly fee for these
    connections, which is recovered against the relevant expenses we
    incur.

Professional and Consulting Fees.

Professional
    and consulting fees consist primarily of accounting fees, legal
    fees and fees paid to information technology and non-information
    technology consultants for services provided for the maintenance
    of our trading platform and information services products.

Occupancy.

Occupancy costs consist primarily
    of office and equipment rent, utilities and commercial rent tax.

Marketing and Advertising.

Marketing and
    advertising expense consists primarily of print and other
    advertising expenses we incur to promote our products and
    services. This expense also includes costs associated with
    attending or exhibiting at industry-sponsored seminars,
    conferences and conventions, and travel and entertainment
    expenses incurred by our sales force to promote our trading
    platform and information services.

General and Administrative.

General and
    administrative expense consists primarily of general travel and
    entertainment, board of directors expenses, charitable
    contributions, provision for doubtful accounts, and various
    state franchise and U.K. value-added taxes.

Expenses may grow in the future, primarily due to investment in
    new products, notably in employee compensation and benefits,
    professional and consulting fees, and general and administrative
    expense. However, as demonstrated by our 2009 operating results,
    we believe that operating leverage can be achieved by increasing
    volumes in existing products and adding new products without
    substantial additions to our infrastructure.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates

This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations discusses our Consolidated
    Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States, also referred to as U.S. GAAP. The preparation of
    these financial statements requires management to make estimates
    and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses
    during the reporting periods. We base our estimates and
    judgments on



historical experience and on various other factors that we
    believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results
    may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or
    conditions. Note 2 of the Notes to our Consolidated
    Financial Statements includes a summary of the significant
    accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Use of
    Estimates

On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and
    judgments, particularly as they relate to accounting policies
    that management believes are critical. That is, these accounting
    policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial
    condition and results of operations and they require
    management’s most difficult, subjective or complex
    judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about
    the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

We continually monitor collections and payments from our
    customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts. The
    allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the historical
    collection experience and specific collection issues that have
    been identified.

Software
    Development Costs

We capitalize certain costs associated with the development of
    internal use software at the point at which the conceptual
    formulation, design and testing of possible software project
    alternatives have been completed. We capitalize employee
    compensation and related benefits and third party consulting
    costs incurred during the preliminary software project stage.
    Once the product is ready for its intended use, such costs are
    amortized on a straight-line basis over three years. We review
    the amounts capitalized for impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of
    the assets may not be recoverable.

Revenue
    Recognition

The majority of our revenues are derived from monthly
    distribution fees and commissions for trades executed on our
    platform that are billed to our broker-dealer clients on a
    monthly basis. We also derive revenues from technology products
    and services, information and user access fees, investment
    income and other income.

Commission revenue.

Commissions are generally
    calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of
    bonds traded on the platform and vary based on the type and
    maturity of the bond traded. Under our transaction fee plans,
    bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter
    maturities are generally charged lower commissions, while bonds
    that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities
    generally command higher commissions. For trades that we execute
    between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer
    clients on a riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty
    to both the buyer and the seller, we earn the commission through
    the difference in price between the two

back-to-back

trades.

Technology products and services.

We generate
    revenues from technology software licenses, maintenance and
    support services (referred to as post-contract technical support
    or “PCS”) and professional consulting services.
    Revenue is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or
    determinable and collection is considered probable. We generally
    sell software licenses and services together as part of
    multiple-element arrangements. We also enter into contracts for
    technology integration consulting services unrelated to any
    software product. When we enter into a multiple-element
    arrangement, the residual method is used to allocate the total
    fee among the elements of the arrangement. Under the residual
    method, license revenue is recognized upon delivery when
    vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all
    of the undelivered elements in the arrangement, but does not
    exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the
    arrangement. Each license arrangement requires that we analyze
    the individual elements in the transaction and estimate the fair
    value of each undelivered element, which typically includes PCS
    and professional services. License revenue consists of license
    fees charged for the use of our products under perpetual and, to
    a lesser extent, term license arrangements. License revenue from
    a perpetual arrangement is generally recognized upon delivery
    while license revenue from a term arrangement is recognized
    ratably over the duration of the arrangement on a



straight-line basis. If the professional services are essential
    to the functionality of the software product, the license
    revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance or satisfaction
    of the service obligation.

Professional services are generally separately priced, are
    available from a number of suppliers and are typically not
    essential to the functionality of our software products.
    Revenues from these services are recognized separately from the
    license fee. Generally, revenue from

time-and-materials

consulting contracts is recognized as services are performed.

PCS includes telephone support, bug fixes and unspecified rights
    to product upgrades and enhancements, and is recognized ratably
    over the term of the service period, which is generally
    12 months. We estimate the fair value of the PCS portion of
    an arrangement based on the price charged for PCS when sold
    separately. We sell PCS on a separate, standalone basis when
    customers renew PCS.

Revenues from contracts for technology integration consulting
    services are recognized on the

percentage-of-completion

method.

Percentage-of-completion

accounting involves calculating the percentage of services
    provided during the reporting period compared to the total
    estimated services to be provided over the duration of the
    contract. If estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur,
    a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss
    first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses
    are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct
    and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total
    revenues that will be generated by the contract. Revenues
    recognized in excess of billings are recorded as unbilled
    services. Billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded
    as deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met.

Initial

set-up

fees.

We enter into agreements with our
    broker-dealer clients pursuant to which we provide access to our
    platform through a non-exclusive and non-transferable license.
    Broker-dealer clients may pay an initial

set-up

fee,
    which is typically due and payable upon execution of the
    broker-dealer agreement. The initial

set-up

fee
    varies by agreement. Revenue is recognized over the initial term
    of the agreement, which is generally two years.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

We measure and recognize compensation expense for all
    share-based payment awards based on their estimated fair values
    measured as of the grant date. These costs are recognized as an
    expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the
    requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period,
    with an offsetting increase to additional paid-in capital.

Income
    Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability
    method. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of
    temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax
    bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the
    enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such
    differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax
    assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
    income in the period that includes the enactment date. A
    valuation allowance is recognized against deferred tax assets if
    it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized
    in future years. We recognize interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits in general and administrative expenses
    in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Business
    Combinations, Goodwill and Intangibles Assets

Business combinations were completed prior to December 31,
    2008 and were accounted for under the purchase method. The total
    cost of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying net assets
    based on their respective estimated fair values. The excess of
    the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net
    assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair
    value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is
    judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant
    estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to
    future cash flows, discount rates, growth rates and asset lives.

Goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives are not
    amortized. We perform an impairment review of goodwill on an
    annual basis and more frequently if circumstances change.
    Intangible assets with definite lives, including purchased
    technologies, customer relationships and other intangible
    assets, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their
    estimated useful lives, ranging from five to ten years.
    Intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or
    circumstances indicate a possible impairment.



Segment
    Results

As an electronic, multi-dealer platform for trading fixed-income
    securities, our operations constitute a single business segment.
    Because of the highly integrated nature of the financial markets
    in which we compete and the integration of our worldwide
    business activities, we believe that results by geographic
    region, products or types of clients are not necessarily
    meaningful in understanding our business.

Results
    of Operations

Year
    Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended
    December 31, 2008

Overview

Total revenues increased by $21.4 million or 22.9% to
    $114.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009
    from $93.1 million for the year ended December 31,
    2008. This increase in total revenues was primarily due to an
    increase in commissions of $22.6 million and in technology
    products and services revenues of $1.2 million, offset by a
    decrease in investment income of $2.3 million and other
    income of $0.4 million. Technology products and services
    revenues reflect the impact of the Greenline acquisition in
    March 2008. A 15.0% decrease in the average exchange rate of the
    Pound Sterling compared to the U.S. dollar from the year
    ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31,
    2009 had the effect of reducing European revenues by
    $3.7 million.

Total expenses increased by $4.1 million or 5.2% to
    $84.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009
    from $80.3 million for the year ended December 31,
    2008. An increase in employee compensation and benefits of
    $6.5 million was offset by declines in professional and
    consulting fees of $1.3 million and depreciation and
    amortization of $1.1 million. The change in the foreign
    currency rates had the effect of reducing European expenses by
    $2.2 million. The 2008 results include Greenline expenses
    from the date of the acquisition.

Income before taxes increased by $17.2 million or 134.1% to
    $30.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009
    from $12.8 million for the year ended December 31,
    2008. Net income increased by $8.2 million or 103.8% to
    $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009,
    from $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.

For volume reporting purposes, transactions in foreign
    currencies are converted to U.S. dollars at average monthly
    rates. Prior to September 1, 2008, no fees were charged on
    U.S. high-grade single-dealer inquiries. Such single-dealer
    inquiry trading volume amounted to $6.3 billion for the
    year ended December 31, 2008. Effective September 1,
    2008, single-dealer inquiry trades are charged commissions in
    accordance with the U.S. high-grade



corporate bond fee plan. CDS trading volume data are included in
    Other. Trading volume data related to
    DealerAxess

®

bond trading between broker-dealer clients are included in
    either U.S. high-grade or Other trading volumes, as
    appropriate.

The increase in U.S. high-grade volume was due primarily to
    an increase in overall market volume as measured by FINRA TRACE,
    offset by a decline in the Company’s estimated market share
    of total U.S. high-grade corporate bond volume as reported
    by FINRA TRACE from 6.6% for the year ended December 31,
    2008 to 6.2% for the year ended December 31, 2009.
    Estimated FINRA TRACE U.S. high-grade volume increased by
    41.3% from $2,028 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 to $2,865 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2009. Eurobond volumes increased by 58.7% for
    the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2008, primarily due to the improvement in
    market conditions. Other volume increased by 16.6% for the year
    ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2008, primarily due to higher high-yield and
    agencies volume, offset by lower credit default swap volume.

Our average variable transaction fee per million for the years
    ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was as follows:

Total



The U.S. high-grade average variable transaction fee per
    million increased from $121 per million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 to $179 per million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, primarily due to the introduction of our
    execution services desk, the introduction of new dealers on the
    platform that pay higher variable fees per million and the
    longer maturity of trades executed on the platform, for which we
    charge higher commissions. Eurobond average variable transaction
    fee per million increased from $112 per million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 to $138 per million for the year
    ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to a larger
    percentage of Eurobond volume in products that carry higher fees
    per million, principally high-yield bonds. Other average
    variable transaction fee per million increased from $158 per
    million for the year ended December 31, 2008 to $203 per
    million for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due
    to a higher percentage of volume in products that carry higher
    fees per million, principally high-yield bonds.

Technology Products and Services.

Technology
    products and services revenues increased by $1.2 million or
    14.3% to $9.8 million for the year ended December 31,
    2009 from $8.6 million for the year ended December 31,
    2008. The increase was primarily a result of technology
    integration consulting services.

Information and User Access Fees.

Information
    and user access fees increased by $0.2 million or 3.8% to
    $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from
    $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Investment Income.

Investment income decreased
    by $2.3 million or 64.9% to $1.2 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2009 from $3.5 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008. This decrease was primarily due to
    lower interest rates.

Other.

Other revenues decreased by
    $0.4 million or 29.6% to $1.1 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2009 from $1.5 million for the year

Employee Compensation and Benefits.

Employee
    compensation and benefits increased by $6.5 million or
    14.8% to $50.3 million for the year ended December 31,
    2009 from $43.8 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. This increase was primarily attributable
    to higher incentive compensation of $4.9 million and
    stock-based compensation expense of $1.3 million. The total
    number of employees increased to 212 as of December 31,
    2009 from 185 as of December 31, 2008. As a percentage of
    total revenues, employee compensation and benefits expense
    decreased to 43.9% for the year ended December 31, 2009
    from 47.1% for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Depreciation and Amortization.

Depreciation
    and amortization expense decreased by $1.1 million or 13.8%
    to $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009
    from $7.9 million for the year ended December 31,
    2008. The decrease was primarily due to declines in amortization
    of intangible assets of $0.5 million and software
    development costs of $0.5 million. The intangible
    amortization expense reduction was primarily due to a
    $0.7 million TWS impairment charge recorded in 2008 to
    reflect negative current period operating results and reduced
    revenue expectations for connectivity solutions principally
    delivered to broker-dealers. For the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, we capitalized
    $1.9 million and $2.4 million, respectively, of
    software development costs, and $4.9 million and
    $1.7 million, respectively, of equipment and leasehold
    improvements. The 2009 equipment and leasehold improvement
    expenditures included $2.2 million associated with the move
    of our corporate offices to new premises in New York City in the
    first quarter of 2010.

Technology and Communications.

Technology and
    communications expense increased by $0.1 million or 1.5% to
    $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from
    $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Professional and Consulting Fees.

Professional
    and consulting fees decreased by $1.3 million or 15.9% to
    $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from
    $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The
    decrease was principally due to lower legal fees of
    $0.7 million and information technology consultant costs of
    $0.3 million.

Occupancy.

Occupancy costs increased by
    $0.2 million or 8.2% to $3.1 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2009 from $2.9 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008. The increase was principally due
    to additional rental costs associated with new premises leased
    in New York City in the fourth quarter of 2009.

Marketing and Advertising.

Marketing and
    advertising expense decreased by $0.2 million or 4.9% to
    $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from
    $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
    Higher travel and entertainment expenses of $0.2 million
    were more than offset by lower advertising and promotional costs.



General and Administrative.

General and
    administrative expense decreased by $0.1 million or 2.4% to
    $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from
    $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
    Higher trade settlement costs of $0.4 million were more
    than offset by lower charges for doubtful accounts of
    $0.6 million.

Provision
    for Income Tax

We recorded an income tax provision of $13.9 million and
    $4.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and
    2008, respectively. The increase in the tax provision was
    primarily attributable to the $17.2 million increase in
    pre-tax income. With the exception of the payment of certain
    foreign and state and local taxes, the provision for income
    taxes was a non-cash expense since we had available net
    operating loss carryforwards and tax credits to offset the cash
    payment of taxes.

Our consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 was 46.4% compared to 38.5% for the year
    ended December 31, 2008. During 2009, we reduced the tax
    rates used for recording the deferred tax assets to reflect the
    tax rates anticipated to be in effect when the temporary
    differences are expected to reverse, resulting in a decrease in
    the deferred tax asset and an increase in tax expense of
    $1.6 million. The 2009 tax rate change reflects a
    refinement in our state and local tax apportionment methodology.
    The 2008 effective tax rate reflects a higher portion of
    earnings generated in lower tax rate jurisdictions. Our
    consolidated effective tax rate can vary from period to period
    depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business
    mix of our earnings and changes in tax legislation and tax
    rates. Due to our net deferred tax asset balance, a decrease in
    tax rates results in a reduction in our deferred tax balance and
    an increase in tax expense.

As of December 31, 2009, we had net operating loss
    carryforwards of $82.9 million and tax credit carryforwards
    of $3.3 million for income tax purposes. The deferred tax
    asset of $24.0 million at December 31, 2009 includes a
    valuation allowance of $0.7 million arising from certain
    tax credit and foreign and state tax loss carryforwards. This
    valuation allowance was deemed appropriate due to available
    evidence indicating that some of the deferred tax assets might
    not be realized in future years.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended
    December 31, 2007

Overview

Total revenues decreased by $0.6 million or 0.6% to
    $93.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008
    from $93.6 million for the year ended December 31,
    2007. This decrease in total revenues was primarily due to
    declines in commissions of $6.7 million and investment
    income of $1.8 million, offset by an increase in technology
    products and services revenues of $7.8 million. Technology
    products and services revenues reflect the impact of the
    Greenline and TWS acquisitions. A 7.5% decrease in the average
    exchange rate of the Pound Sterling compared to the
    U.S. dollar from the year ended December 31, 2007 to
    the year ended December 31 2008 had the effect of reducing
    European revenues by $1.6 million.

Total expenses increased by $3.9 million or 5.1% to
    $80.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008
    from $76.4 million for the year ended December 31,
    2007. The Greenline acquisition increased expenses by
    $7.2 million, including $3.5 million of employee
    compensation and benefits. The $3.9 million increase in
    total expenses was primarily due to higher employee compensation
    and benefits of $0.8 million, depreciation and amortization
    of $0.7 million, technology and communications of
    $0.8 million and marketing and advertising of
    $0.9 million. The change in the foreign currency rates had
    the effect of reducing European expenses by $1.0 million.

Income before taxes decreased by $4.4 million or 25.6% to
    $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    from $17.3 million for the year ended December 31,
    2007. Net income decreased by $2.4 million or 23.5% to
    $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    from $10.3 million for the year ended December 31,
    2007.

    ended December 31, 2008 from $34.9 million for the

    DealerAxess

monthly minimum fees were zero and $3.5 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    majority of the
    DealerAxess

®

minimum fee commitments expired as of June 30, 2007. On
    June 1, 2007, we introduced a new fee plan for European
    corporate bond trades. Similar to the U.S. high-grade plan,
    the new European high-grade corporate bond fee plan incorporates
    a monthly distribution fee and a transaction fee that is
    dependent on the type of bond traded and the maturity of the
    issue.

The change in the average exchange rate of the Pound Sterling
    compared to the U.S. dollar from the year ended
    December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2008
    had the effect of reducing Eurobond commission revenues by
    $1.5 million.



The following table shows the extent to which the decrease in
    commissions for the year ended December 31, 2008 was
    attributable to changes in transaction volumes, variable
    transaction fees per million, monthly distribution fees and

As previously discussed, prior to September 1, 2008, no
    fees were charged on U.S. high-grade single-dealer
    inquiries. Such single-dealer inquiry trading volume amounted to
    $6.3 billion and $15.1 billion for the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The decrease in U.S. high-grade volume was due primarily to
    a decline in the Company’s estimated market share of total
    U.S. high-grade corporate bond volume as reported by FINRA
    TRACE from 9.4% for the year ended December 31, 2007 to
    6.6% for the year ended December 31, 2008, coupled with a
    decline in overall market volume as measured by FINRA TRACE.
    Estimated FINRA TRACE U.S. high-grade volume decreased by
    9.0% from $2,227 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 to $2,028 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. We believe the resultant lack of
    liquidity in the credit markets led institutional investors to
    reduce overall bond trading activity and conduct a higher
    percentage of their trades directly with their broker-dealer
    counterparties via the telephone, resulting in lower volumes on
    our platform. Other volume decreased by 23.5% for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2007. The decrease was primarily due to lower
    emerging market, agencies and credit default swap volume, offset
    partially by increased high-yield volume.

Our average variable transaction fee per million for the years
    ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was as follows:

Total





The U.S. high-grade average variable transaction fee per
    million increased from $84 per million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 to $121 per million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 due to the longer maturity of trades
    executed on the platform, for which we charge higher
    commissions. The Eurobond average variable transaction fee per
    million decreased from $138 per million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 to $112 per million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, principally from the introduction of the
    new European high-grade fee plan. Other average variable
    transaction fee per million increased from $121 per million for
    the year ended December 31, 2007 to $158 per million for
    the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to a higher
    percentage of volume in products that carry higher fees per
    million, principally high-yield.

Technology Products and Services.

Technology
    products and services revenues increased by $7.8 million to
    $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from
    $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The
    increase was primarily a result of the Greenline acquisition.

Information and User Access Fees.

Information
    and user access fees increased by $0.1 million or 2.5% to
    $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from
    $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Investment Income.

Investment income decreased
    by $1.8 million or 33.7% to $3.5 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 from $5.2 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007. This decrease was primarily due to
    lower interest rates.

Other.

Other revenues decreased by
    $0.1 million or 4.4% to $1.5 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 from $1.6 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007.

Employee Compensation and Benefits.

Employee
    compensation and benefits increased by $0.8 million or 1.8%
    to $43.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008
    from $43.1 million for the year ended December 31,
    2007. This increase was primarily attributable to higher wages
    of $2.4 million, severance costs of $1.0 million and
    stock-based compensation expense of $1.4 million, offset by
    reduced incentive compensation of $3.6 million. The higher
    wages were primarily a result of the Greenline acquisition. The
    total number of employees increased to 185 as of
    December 31, 2008 from 182 as of December 31, 2007. As
    a percentage of total revenues, employee compensation and
    benefits expense increased to 47.1% for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 from 46.0% for the year ended
    December 31, 2007.

Depreciation and Amortization.

Depreciation
    and amortization expense increased by $0.7 million or 9.9%
    to $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008
    from $7.2 million for the year ended December 31,
    2007. An increase in amortization of intangible assets of
    $1.3 million and the TWS impairment charge of
    $0.7 million were offset by a decline in depreciation and
    amortization of hardware and software development costs of
    $1.3 million.



The intangible asset amortization increase was due to the
    $8.3 million of definite-life intangibles created in 2008
    in connection with the Greenline acquisition. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, we capitalized $2.4 million of
    software development costs and $1.7 million of computer and
    related equipment purchases.

Technology and Communications.

Technology and
    communications expense increased by $0.8 million or 11.4%
    to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008
    from $7.5 million for the year ended December 31,
    2007. This increase was attributable to higher expenses
    associated with the purchase of production and market data.

Professional and Consulting Fees.

Professional
    and consulting fees increased by $0.5 million or 7.0% to
    $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from
    $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The
    increase was principally due to higher information technology
    consultant costs of $0.7 million and audit and tax fees of
    $0.2 million, offset by lower recruiting fees of
    $0.5 million.

Occupancy.

Occupancy costs decreased by
    $0.4 million or 11.7% to $2.9 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 from $3.3 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007. The decline was principally due to
    exiting certain leased office space in 2008.

Marketing and Advertising.

Marketing and
    advertising expense increased by $1.1 million or 59.2% to
    $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from
    $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    primarily due to higher travel and entertainment expenses.

General and Administrative.

General and
    administrative expense increased by $0.3 million or 4.6% to
    $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from
    $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    primarily due to increased charges for doubtful accounts of
    $0.8 million.

Provision
    for Income Tax

We recorded an income tax provision of $4.9 million and
    $6.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. The decrease in the tax provision was
    primarily attributable to the $4.4 million decrease in
    pre-tax income. With the exception of the payment of certain
    foreign and state and local taxes, the provision for income
    taxes was a non-cash expense since we had available net
    operating loss carryforwards and tax credits to offset the cash
    payment of taxes.

Our consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 was 38.5% compared to 40.2% for the year
    ended December 31, 2007. The 2008 effective tax rate
    reflects a higher portion of earnings generated in lower tax
    rate jurisdictions. During 2007, we reduced the tax rates used
    for recording the deferred tax asset to reflect the tax rates
    anticipated to be in effect when the temporary differences are
    expected to reverse and to reflect changes in enacted state and
    foreign tax rates, resulting in a decrease in the deferred tax
    asset and an increase in tax expense of $0.5 million. Our
    consolidated effective tax rate can vary from period to period
    depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business
    mix of our earnings and changes in tax legislation and tax
    rates. Due to our net deferred tax asset balance, a decrease in
    tax rates results in a reduction in our deferred tax balance and
    an increase in tax expense.

Quarterly
    Results of Operations

Our quarterly results have varied significantly as a result of:

•

changes in trading volume due to market conditions, changes in
    the number of trading days in certain quarters, and seasonality
    effects caused by slow-downs in trading activity during certain
    periods;

•

changes in the number of broker-dealers and institutional
    investors using our trading platform as well as variation in
    usage by existing clients;

•

expansion of the products we offer to our clients and the effect
    of business acquisitions; and

•

variance in our expenses, particularly employee compensation and
    benefits.

The following table sets forth certain consolidated quarterly
    income statement data for the eight quarters ended
    December 31, 2009. In our opinion, this unaudited
    information has been prepared on a basis consistent with our
    annual



financial statements and includes all adjustments (consisting
    only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair
    statement of the unaudited quarterly data. This information
    should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial
    Statements and related Notes included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

The results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily
    indicative of results that we may achieve for any subsequent
    periods.

Other
    Factors Influencing Liquidity and Capital
    Resources

We are dependent on our broker-dealer clients who are not
    restricted from buying and selling fixed-income securities,
    directly or through their own proprietary or third-party
    platforms, with institutional investors. None of our
    broker-dealer clients is contractually or otherwise obligated to
    continue to use our electronic trading platform. The loss of, or
    a significant reduction in the use of our electronic platform
    by, our broker-dealer clients could reduce our cash flows,
    affect our liquidity and have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations.

We believe that our current resources are adequate to meet our
    liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at
    least the next 12 months. However, our future liquidity and
    capital requirements will depend on a number of factors,
    including expenses associated with product development and
    expansion and new business opportunities that are intended to
    further diversify our revenue stream. We may also acquire or
    invest in technologies, business ventures or products that are
    complementary to our business. In the event we require



any additional financing, it will take the form of equity or
    debt financing. Any additional equity offerings may result in
    dilution to our stockholders. Any debt financings, if available
    at all, may involve restrictive covenants with respect to
    dividends, issuances of additional capital and other financial
    and operational matters related to our business.

We have three regulated subsidiaries, MarketAxess Corporation,
    MarketAxess Europe Limited and MarketAxess Canada Ltd.
    MarketAxess Corporation is a registered broker-dealer in the
    U.S., MarketAxess Europe Limited is a registered multilateral
    trading facility in the U.K. and MarketAxess Canada Ltd. is a
    registered Alternative Trading System in the Province of
    Ontario. As such, they are subject to minimum regulatory capital
    requirements imposed by their respective market regulators that
    are intended to ensure general financial soundness and liquidity
    based on certain minimum capital requirements. The relevant
    regulations prohibit a registrant from repaying borrowings from
    its parent or affiliates, paying cash dividends, making loans to
    its parent or affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions
    that result in a significant reduction in its regulatory net
    capital position without prior notification to or approval from
    its principal regulator. The capital structures of our
    subsidiaries are designed to provide each with capital and
    liquidity consistent with its business and regulatory
    requirements. The following table sets forth the capital
    requirements, as defined, that the Company’s subsidiaries
    were required to maintain as of December 31, 2009:

We execute certain bond transactions between and among
    institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a riskless
    principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and
    the seller in matching

back-to-back

trades, which are then settled through a third-party clearing
    organization. MarketAxess Corporation acts as intermediary on a
    riskless principal basis in these bond transactions by serving
    as counterparty to the two clients involved. Settlement
    typically occurs within one to three trading days after the
    trade date. Cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon
    receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was
    traded. Under a securities clearing agreement with the
    independent third party, MarketAxess Corporation maintains a
    collateral deposit with the clearing broker in the form of cash
    or U.S. government securities. As of December 31, 2009
    and 2008, the collateral deposit included in securities and cash
    provided as collateral in the Consolidated Statements of
    Financial Condition was $0.5 million. MarketAxess
    Corporation is exposed to credit risk in the event a
    counterparty does not fulfill its obligation to complete a
    transaction. Pursuant to the terms of the securities clearing
    agreement between MarketAxess Corporation and the independent
    clearing broker, the clearing broker has the right to charge
    MarketAxess Corporation for losses resulting from a
    counterparty’s failure to fulfill its contractual
    obligations. The losses are not capped at a maximum amount and
    apply to all trades executed through the clearing broker. At
    December 31, 2009, MarketAxess Corporation had not recorded
    any liabilities with regard to this right.

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contracts that
    contain a variety of representations, warranties and general
    indemnifications. Our maximum exposure from any claims under
    these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve claims that
    have not yet occurred. However, based on past experience, we
    expect the risk of loss to be remote.

Prior to 2009, we retained all earnings for investment in our
    business. In October 2009, our Board of Directors approved a
    regular quarterly dividend. The first quarterly cash dividend of
    $0.07 per share was paid to our stockholders in November 2009
    and a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share will be paid on
    March 3, 2010 to stockholders of record as of the close of
    business on February 17, 2010. We expect the total amount
    payable to be approximately $2.7 million. We expect to
    continue paying regular cash dividends, although there is no
    assurance as to such dividends. Any future declaration and
    payment of dividends will be at the sole discretion of our Board
    of Directors.



Effects
    of Inflation

Because the majority of our assets are liquid in nature, they
    are not significantly affected by inflation. However, the rate
    of inflation may affect our expenses, such as employee
    compensation, office leasing costs and communications expenses,
    which may not be readily recoverable in the prices of our
    services. To the extent inflation results in rising interest
    rates and has other adverse effects on the securities markets,
    it may adversely affect our financial position and results of
    operations.

Contractual
    Obligations and Commitments

As of December 31, 2009, we had the following contractual
    obligations and commitments:

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts with a
    noncontrolling stockholder broker-dealer client to hedge the
    exposure to variability in foreign currency cash flows resulting
    from the net investment in our U.K. subsidiary. As of
    December 31, 2009, the notional value of the foreign
    currency forward contract outstanding was $28.0 million and
    the gross and net fair value liability was $0.3 million.

As of December 31, 2009, we had unrecognized tax benefits
    of $2.9 million. Due to the nature of the underlying
    positions, it is not currently possible to schedule the future
    payment obligations by period.

In January 2010, our board of directors approved a quarterly
    dividend to be paid to the holders of the outstanding shares of
    capital stock. A cash dividend of $0.07 per share of common
    stock outstanding or issuable upon conversion of shares of
    non-voting common stock and Series B Preferred Stock
    outstanding, will be payable on March 3, 2010 to
    stockholders of record as of the close of business on
    February 17, 2010. We expect the total amount payable to be
    approximately $2.7 million.

    included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Market risk is the risk of the loss resulting from adverse
    changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and
    foreign currency exchange rates.

Market
    Risk

The global financial services business is, by its nature, risky
    and volatile and is directly affected by many national and
    international factors that are beyond our control. Any one of
    these factors may cause a substantial decline in the
    U.S. and global financial services markets, resulting in
    reduced trading volume and revenues. These events could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

As of December 31, 2009, we had a $71.0 million
    investment in securities

available-for-sale.

Adverse movements, such as a 10% decrease in the value of these
    securities or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these
    securities, could result in a substantial loss. In addition,
    principal gains and losses resulting from these securities could
    on occasion have a disproportionate effect, positive or
    negative, on our financial condition and results of operations
    for any particular reporting period.



See also Item 1A

. Risk Factors

, “Risks Related
    to Our Industry —

Economic, political and market
    factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services
    and harm our business, and our profitability could
    suffer

.”

Interest
    Rate Risk

Interest rate risk represents our exposure to interest rate
    changes with respect to the money market instruments,
    U.S. Treasury obligations and short-term fixed-income
    securities in which we invest. As of December 31, 2009, our
    cash and cash equivalents and securities

available-for-sale

amounted to $174.3 million and were primarily invested in
    money market instruments, U.S. government obligations and
    municipal securities. We do not maintain an inventory of bonds
    that are traded on our platform.

Derivative
    Risk

Our limited derivative risk stems from our activities in the
    foreign currency forward contract market. We use this market to
    mitigate our U.S. dollar versus Pound Sterling exposure
    that arises from the activities of our U.K. subsidiary. As of
    December 31, 2009, the notional value of our foreign
    currency forward contracts was $28.0 million. We do not
    speculate in any derivative instruments.

Credit
    Risk

We act as a riskless principal through our subsidiary,
    MarketAxess Corporation, in certain transactions that we execute
    between clients. We act as an intermediary in these transactions
    by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in
    matching

back-to-back

bond trades, which are then settled through a third-party
    clearing organization. Settlement typically occurs within one to
    three trading days after the trade date. Cash settlement of the
    transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying
    instrument that was traded.

We are exposed to credit risk in our role as trading
    counterparty to our clients. We are exposed to the risk that
    third parties that owe us money, securities or other assets will
    not perform their obligations. These parties may default on
    their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity,
    operational failure or other reasons. Adverse movements in the
    prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions
    can increase our risk. Where the unmatched position or failure
    to deliver is prolonged, there may also be regulatory capital
    charges required to be taken by us. The policies and procedures
    we use to manage this credit risk are new and untested. There
    can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will
    effectively mitigate our exposure to credit risk.

    Condition and Results of Operations,” in the section

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of MarketAxess Holdings Inc. is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting as defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
    external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting includes those policies and
    procedures that:

(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
    reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
    transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
    recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the Company; and

(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
    timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
    of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect
    on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, management
    used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control
    — Integrated Framework

.

Based on our assessment and those criteria, management concluded
    that the Company maintained effective internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2009.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009 has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.



Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of MarketAxess
    Holdings Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of MarketAxess Holdings Inc. and its
    subsidiaries at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results
    of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2009 in conformity
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained,
    in all material respects, effective internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying “Management’s Report on Internal Control
    over Financial Reporting.” Our responsibility is to express
    opinions on these financial statements and on the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our
    integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
    the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
    whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
    statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

MARKETAXESS
    HOLDINGS INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Organization
    and Principal Business Activity

MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (the “Company”) was
    incorporated in the State of Delaware on April 11, 2000.
    Through its subsidiaries, the Company operates an electronic
    trading platform for corporate bonds and other types of
    fixed-income instruments through which the Company’s
    institutional investor clients can access the liquidity provided
    by its broker-dealer clients. The Company’s multi-dealer
    trading platform allows its institutional investor clients to
    simultaneously request competitive, executable bids or offers
    from multiple broker-dealers, and to execute trades with the
    broker-dealer of their choice. The Company offers its clients
    the ability to trade U.S. high-grade corporate bonds,
    European high-grade corporate bonds, credit default swaps,
    agencies, high yield and emerging markets bonds. The
    Company’s
    DealerAxess

®

trading service allows dealers to trade fixed-income securities
    and credit default swaps with each other on its platform. The
    Company executes certain bond transactions between and among
    institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a riskless
    principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and
    the seller in matching

back-to-back

trades, which then settle through a third-party clearing
    organization. Through its Corporate
    BondTicker

tm

service, the Company provides fixed-income market data,
    analytics and compliance tools that help its clients make
    trading decisions. In addition, the Company provides FIX
    (Financial Information eXchange) message management tools,
    connectivity solutions and ancillary technology services that
    facilitate the electronic communication of order information
    between trading counterparties.

The Company’s stockholder broker-dealer clients as of
    January 1, 2009 were BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse and
    JPMorgan. These broker-dealer clients constitute related parties
    of the Company (together, the “Stockholder Broker-Dealer
    Clients”). For 2008 and 2007, three dealers and seven
    dealers, respectively, were considered to be Stockholder
    Broker-Dealer Clients. See Note 10, “Related
    Parties.”

2.

Significant
    Accounting Policies

Basis
    of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions
    and balances have been eliminated.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash maintained at
    U.S. and U.K. banks and in money market funds. The Company
    defines cash equivalents as short-term interest-bearing
    investments with maturities at the time of purchase of three
    months or less.

Securities

Available-for-Sale

The Company classifies its marketable securities as

available-for-sale

securities. Unrealized marketable securities gains and losses,
    net of taxes, are reflected as a net amount under the caption of
    accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated
    Statements of Financial Condition. Realized gains and losses are
    recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in other
    revenues. For the purpose of computing realized gains and
    losses, cost is determined on a specific identification basis.

The Company assesses whether an

other-than-temporary

impairment loss on the investments has occurred due to declines
    in fair value or other market conditions. Declines in fair
    values that are considered

other-than-temporary

are recorded as charges in the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations. No charges for

other-than-temporary

losses were recorded during 2009, 2008 or 2007.

Fair
    Value Financial Instruments

Pursuant to a new accounting standard adopted in 2008, fair
    value is defined as “the price that would be received to
    sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
    transaction between market participants at the



MARKETAXESS
    HOLDINGS INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

measurement date.” The standard also establishes a
    three-tiered fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to
    valuation techniques used in fair value calculations. The three
    levels of inputs are defined as Level 1 (unadjusted quoted
    prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets),
    Level 2 (inputs that are observable in the marketplace
    other than those inputs classified in Level 1) and
    Level 3 (inputs that are unobservable in the marketplace).
    The Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at
    fair value on a recurring basis consist of its securities

available-for-sale

portfolio and one foreign currency forward contract.

Securities
    and Cash Provided as Collateral

Securities provided as collateral consist of
    U.S. government obligations and cash. Collectively, these
    amounts are used as collateral for standby letters of credit,
    electronic bank settlements, foreign currency forward contracts
    to hedge the Company’s net investments in certain foreign
    subsidiaries and broker-dealer clearance accounts.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

The Company continually monitors collections and payments from
    its clients and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts.
    The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the historical
    collection experience and specific collection issues that have
    been identified. Additions to the allowance for doubtful
    accounts are charged to bad debt expense, which is included in
    general and administrative expense in the Company’s
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The allowance for doubtful accounts was $0.9 million,
    $1.0 million and $0.9 million as of December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The provision for bad debts
    was $0.7 million, $1.3 million and $0.4 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Write-offs and other charges against the allowance
    for doubtful accounts were $0.6 million, $0.9 million
    and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Depreciation
    and Amortization

Fixed assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
    The Company uses the straight-line method of depreciation over
    three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are stated at cost
    and are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser
    of the life of the improvement or the remaining term of the
    lease.

Software
    Development Costs

The Company capitalizes certain costs associated with the
    development of internal use software at the point at which the
    conceptual formulation, design and testing of possible software
    project alternatives have been completed. The Company
    capitalizes employee compensation and related benefits and third
    party consulting costs incurred during the preliminary software
    project stage. Once the product is ready for its intended use,
    such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over three
    years. The Company reviews the amounts capitalized for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable.

Foreign
    Currency Translation and Forward Contracts

Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
    translated using exchange rates at the end of the period;
    revenues and expenses are translated at average monthly rates.
    Gains and losses on foreign currency translation are a component
    of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated
    Statements of Financial Condition. Transaction gains and losses
    are recorded in general and administrative expense in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.



MARKETAXESS
    HOLDINGS INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to
    hedge its net investment in its U.K. subsidiary. Gains and
    losses on these transactions are deferred and included in
    accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated
    Statements of Financial Condition.

Revenue
    Recognition

The majority of the Company’s revenues are derived from
    monthly distribution fees and commissions for trades executed on
    its platform that are billed to its broker-dealer clients on a
    monthly basis. The Company also derives revenues from technology
    products and services, information and user access fees,
    investment income and other income.

Commission revenue.

Commissions are generally
    calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of
    bonds traded on the platform and vary based on the type and
    maturity of the bond traded. Under the Company’s
    transaction fee plans, bonds that are more actively traded or
    that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower
    commissions, while bonds that are less actively traded or that
    have longer maturities generally command higher commissions. For
    trades that the Company executes between and among institutional
    investor and broker-dealer clients on a riskless principal basis
    by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller, the
    Company earns the commission through the difference in price
    between the two

back-to-back

trades.

Technology products and services.

The Company
    generates revenues from technology software licenses,
    maintenance and support services (referred to as post-contract
    technical support or “PCS”) and professional
    consulting services. Revenue is generally recognized when
    persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
    occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is
    considered probable. The Company generally sells software
    licenses and services together as part of multiple-element
    arrangements. The Company also enters into contracts for
    technology integration consulting services unrelated to any
    software product. When the Company enters into a
    multiple-element arrangement, the residual method is used to
    allocate the total fee among the elements of the arrangement.
    Under the residual method, license revenue is recognized upon
    delivery when vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value
    exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement,
    but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in
    the arrangement. Each license arrangement requires that the
    Company analyze the individual elements in the transaction and
    estimate the fair value of each undelivered element, which
    typically includes PCS and professional services. License
    revenue consists of license fees charged for the use of the
    Company’s products under perpetual and, to a lesser extent,
    term license arrangements. License revenue from a perpetual
    arrangement is generally recognized upon delivery while license
    revenue from a term arrangement is recognized ratably over the
    duration of the arrangement on a straight-line basis. If the
    professional services are essential to the functionality of the
    software product, the license revenue is recognized upon
    customer acceptance or satisfaction of the service obligation.

Professional services are generally separately priced, are
    available from a number of suppliers and are typically not
    essential to the functionality of the Company’s software
    products. Revenues from these services are recognized separately
    from the license fee. Generally, revenue from

time-and-materials

consulting contracts is recognized as services are performed.

PCS includes telephone support, bug fixes and unspecified rights
    to product upgrades and enhancements, and is recognized ratably
    over the term of the service period, which is generally
    12 months. The Company estimates the fair value of the PCS
    portion of an arrangement based on the price charged for PCS
    when sold separately. The Company sells PCS on a separate,
    standalone basis when customers renew PCS.

Revenues from contracts for technology integration consulting
    services are recognized on the

percentage-of-completion

method.

Percentage-of-completion

accounting involves calculating the percentage of services
    provided during the reporting period compared to the total
    estimated services to be provided over the duration of the
    contract. If estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur,
    a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss
    first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses
    are determined to be the amount by which the



MARKETAXESS
    HOLDINGS INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the
    estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract.
    There were no contract loss provisions recorded as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008. Revenues recognized in excess
    of billings are recorded as unbilled services. Billings in
    excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenues
    until revenue recognition criteria are met.

Initial

set-up

fees.

The Company enters into agreements with its
    broker-dealer clients pursuant to which the Company provides
    access to its platform through a non-exclusive and
    non-transferable license. Broker-dealer clients may pay an
    initial

set-up

fee,
    which is typically due and payable upon execution of the
    broker-dealer agreement. The initial

set-up

fee
    varies by agreement. Revenue is recognized over the initial term
    of the agreement, which is generally two years.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all
    share-based payment awards based on their estimated fair values
    measured as of the grant date. These costs are recognized as an
    expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the
    requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period,
    with an offsetting increase to additional paid-in capital.

Income
    Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability
    method. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of
    temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax
    bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the
    enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such
    differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax
    assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
    income in the period that includes the enactment date. A
    valuation allowance is recognized against deferred tax assets if
    it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized
    in future years. The Company recognizes interest and penalties
    related to unrecognized tax benefits in general and
    administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations.

Business
    Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Business acquisitions were completed prior to December 31,
    2008 and were accounted for under the purchase method of
    accounting. The total cost of an acquisition is allocated to the
    underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair
    values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair
    values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
    Determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and often involves
    the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including
    assumptions with respect to future cash flows, discount rates,
    growth rates and asset lives.

Goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives are not
    amortized. An impairment review of goodwill is performed on an
    annual basis and more frequently if circumstances change.
    Intangible assets with definite lives, including purchased
    technologies, customer relationships and other intangible
    assets, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their
    estimated useful lives, ranging from five to ten years. The
    Company has no intangibles with indefinite lives. Intangible
    assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances
    indicate the existence of a possible impairment.

Earnings
    Per Share

Earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated using the
    two-class method. Basic EPS is computed by dividing the net
    income attributable to common stock by the weighted-average
    number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period,
    including consideration of the two-class method to the extent
    that participating securities were outstanding during the
    period. Under the two-class method, undistributed net income is
    allocated to common stock and participating securities based on
    their respective right to share in dividends. The Series B
    Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of common stock and
    also includes a right whereby, upon the declaration or payment
    of a



MARKETAXESS
    HOLDINGS INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

dividend or distribution on the common stock, a dividend or
    distribution must also be declared or paid on the Series B
    Preferred Stock based on the number of shares of common stock
    into which such securities were convertible at the time. Due to
    these rights, the Series B Preferred Stock is considered a
    participating security requiring the use of the two-class method
    for the computation of basic EPS.

Diluted EPS is computed using the more dilutive of the
    (a) if-converted method or (b) two-class method. Since
    the Series B Preferred Stock participates equally with the
    common stock in dividends and unallocated income, diluted EPS
    under the if-converted method is equivalent to the two-class
    method. Weighted-average shares outstanding of common stock
    reflects the dilutive effect that could occur if convertible
    securities or other contracts to issue common stock were
    converted into or exercised for common stock.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
    management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
    contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
    statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
    during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
    those estimates.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued authoritative guidance on revenue
    recognition. The guidance requires entities to allocate revenue
    in an arrangement with multiple deliverables using estimated
    selling prices of the delivered goods and services based on a
    selling price hierarchy. The guidance eliminates the residual
    method of revenue allocation and requires revenue to be
    allocated using the relative selling price method. The guidance
    also removes tangible products from the scope of software
    revenue guidance and provides guidance on determining whether
    software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible
    product are covered by the scope of the software revenue
    guidance. Adoption will be applied on a prospective basis for
    revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in
    fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with
    early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect adoption
    of the new revenue recognition guidance to have a material
    impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

In June 2009, the FASB issued “The FASB Accounting
    Standards
    Codification

tm

and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, a
    replacement of FASB Statement No. 162” (the
    “Codification”), which establishes the Codification as
    the source of authoritative accounting principles to be applied
    in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The
    Codification explicitly recognizes rules and interpretive
    releases of the SEC under federal securities laws as
    authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. The Codification does
    not change GAAP and is effective for interim and annual
    reporting periods ending after September 15, 2009. The
    adoption of this standard had no material effect on the
    Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

In May 2009, the FASB issued a standard regarding the accounting
    for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet
    date but before the financial statements are issued or are
    available to be issued. The standard requires the disclosure of
    the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events
    and the basis for that date and is effective for interim and
    annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009. The
    adoption of this standard had no material effect on the
    Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

In April 2009, the FASB issued a standard that requires

    financial statements as well as in annual financial statements.
    The standard is effective for interim and annual periods ending

In March 2008, the FASB issued a standard that expands the
    disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging
    activities. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2008. The adoption

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior
    years’ financial statements in order to conform to the
    current year presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect
    on previously reported net income.

Acquisitions

On March 5, 2008, the Company acquired all of the
    outstanding capital stock of Greenline Financial Technologies,
    Inc. (“Greenline”), an Illinois-based provider of
    integration, testing and management solutions for FIX-related
    products and services designed to optimize electronic trading of
    fixed-income, equity and other exchange-based products, and
    approximately ten percent of the outstanding capital stock of
    TradeHelm, Inc., a Delaware corporation that was spun-out from
    Greenline immediately prior to the acquisition. The acquisition
    of Greenline broadens the range of technology services that the
    Company offers to institutional financial markets, provides an
    expansion of the Company’s client base, including global
    exchanges and hedge funds, and further diversifies the
    Company’s revenues beyond the core electronic credit
    trading products. The results of operations of Greenline are
    included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date
    of the acquisition.

The aggregate consideration for the Greenline acquisition was
    $41.1 million, comprised of $34.7 million in cash,
    725,923 shares of common stock valued at $5.8 million
    and $0.6 million of acquisition-related costs. In addition,
    the sellers were eligible to receive up to an aggregate of
    $3.0 million in cash, subject to Greenline attaining
    certain earn-out targets in 2008 and 2009. A total of
    $1.4 million was paid to the sellers in 2009 based on the
    2008 earn-out target, bringing the aggregate consideration to
    $42.4 million. The 2009 earn-out target was not met. A
    total of $2.0 million of the purchase price, which had been
    deposited into escrow accounts to satisfy potential indemnity
    claims, was distributed to the sellers in March 2009. The shares
    of common stock issued to each selling shareholder of Greenline
    were released in two equal installments on December 20,
    2008 and December 20, 2009, respectively. The value
    ascribed to the shares was discounted from the market value to
    reflect the non-marketability of such shares during the
    restriction period. The purchase price allocation is as follows

    and five years have been assigned to the customer relationships
    intangible and all other amortizable intangibles, respectively.
    The identifiable intangible assets and goodwill are not
    deductible for tax purposes.

The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial
    information reflects the results of operations of the Company
    for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, as if the

In November 2007, the Company acquired certain assets and
    assumed certain obligations of Trade West Systems, LLC
    (“TWS”), a Utah-based financial software and
    technology services provider focused on providing gateway
    adapters to connect order management systems and trading systems
    to fixed-income trading venues. The aggregate consideration for
    the TWS acquisition was $3.1 million, comprised of
    $3.0 million in cash and $0.1 million of
    acquisition-related costs. In addition, 64,642 shares of
    the Company’s common stock were issued to the seller. The
    shares of common stock issued have been characterized as
    compensation expense and, accordingly, are not included in the
    purchase price. Stock compensation expense totaling
    $1.0 million was recognized over the vesting period.
    One-half of these shares vested on January 1, 2009 and the
    balance vested on January 1, 2010. The acquisition of TWS

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As of December 31, 2007, the Company had $13.1 million
    invested in municipal auction rate securities
    (“MARS”). Liquidity for these securities is typically
    provided by an auction process that resets the applicable
    interest rate at pre-determined

35-day

intervals. Auctions for six securities with a par value of
    $11.2 million began to fail in February 2008 and, as a
    result, the Company had been unable to liquidate these holdings.
    During 2008, all of the securities were redeemed or had
    successful auctions at par value. The Company no longer has any
    investments in MARS.

The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts with
    a noncontrolling broker-dealer client to hedge its exposure to
    variability in foreign currency cash flows resulting from the
    net investment in its U.K. subsidiary. The Company assesses each
    foreign currency forward contract to ensure that it is highly
    effective at reducing the exposure being hedged. The Company
    designates each foreign currency forward contract as a hedge,
    assesses the risk management objective and strategy, including
    identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item and
    the risk exposure and how effectiveness is to be assessed
    prospectively and retrospectively. These hedges are for a
    one-month period and are used to limit exposure to foreign
    currency exchange rate fluctuations. The gross and net fair
    value liability of $0.3 million as of December 31,
    2009 is included in accounts payable and the gross and net fair
    value asset of $0.3 million as of December 31, 2008 is
    included in accounts receivable in the Consolidated Statements
    of Financial Condition. Gains or losses on foreign currency
    forward contracts designated as hedges are included in
    accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated
    Statements of Financial Condition. A summary of the foreign
    currency forward contract is as follows:

    $0.5 million for 2013 and $0.3 million for 2014.

During the third quarter of 2008, the Company determined that
    the technology, customer relationships and tradename intangible
    assets recognized in connection with the TWS acquisition were
    impaired. A charge of $0.7 million was recorded to reflect
    negative current period operating results and reduced revenue
    expectations for connectivity solutions principally delivered to

As of December 31, 2009, the Company has deferred tax
    assets associated with stock-based compensation of approximately
    $5.8 million. There is a risk that the ultimate tax benefit
    realized upon the exercise of stock options or vesting of
    restricted stock could be less than the tax benefit previously
    recognized and in a manner sufficient to exhaust the
    additional-paid-in-capital pool. If this should occur, any
    excess tax benefit previously recognized would be reversed,
    resulting in an increase in tax expense. Since the tax benefit
    to be realized in the future is unknown, it is not currently
    possible to estimate the impact on the deferred tax balance. As
    of December 31, 2009, the additional

paid-in-capital

pool is approximately $2.8 million.

In 2000 and 2001, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. and MarketAxess
    Corporation had an ownership change within the meaning of
    Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Net operating
    loss carryforwards relating to the ownership change are
    $37.2 million as of December 31, 2009. However, only
    $4.8 million is deemed utilizable and recognized as a net
    operating loss carryforward. Greenline experienced an ownership
    change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal
    Revenue Code in 2008. The Company does not believe that this
    ownership change significantly impacts the ability to utilize
    existing or acquired net operating loss carryforwards. In
    addition, the Company’s net operating loss and tax credit
    carryforwards may be subject to additional annual limitations if
    there is a 50% or greater change in the Company’s
    ownership, as determined over a rolling three-year period.

The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is
    dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during
    the periods in which the temporary differences become
    deductible. If it is not more likely than not that some portion
    or all of the gross deferred income tax assets will be realized
    in future years, a valuation allowance is recorded. As a result
    of the implementation of a new accounting standard effective
    January 1, 2007, certain deferred tax assets aggregating
    $14.1 million were no longer recognized and the related
    valuation allowance was reversed effective January 1, 2007.
    As of December 31, 2009, the valuation allowance relates to
    certain tax credits and foreign and state tax loss carryforwards
    that are not expected to be realized. A summary of the changes
    in the valuation allowance follows:

The Company or one of its subsidiaries files U.S. federal,
    state and foreign income tax returns. No income tax returns have
    been audited, with the exception of New York city and state
    (through 2003) and Connecticut state (through
    2003) tax returns. The Company’s New York state
    franchise tax returns for 2004 through 2006 are currently under
    examination. The Company cannot estimate when the examination
    will conclude. An examination of the New York state income tax
    returns for 2000 through 2003 concluded in 2008 resulting in a
    net payment by the Company of $0.1 million. During 2007, an
    examination of the New York City tax returns for 2001 to 2003
    concluded with no adjustments. In addition, an examination of
    the Company’s Connecticut income tax returns for 2003 and
    2004 concluded in 2007 resulting in a payment of taxes and
    interest aggregating $0.1 million.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company has unrecognized tax
    benefits of $2.9 million. If recognized, this entire amount
    would impact the effective tax rate. The Company currently
    anticipates the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to increase
    by approximately $0.3 million by December 31, 2010. A
    reconciliation of the unrecognized tax benefits is as follows

As a result of the implementation of a new accounting standard
    effective January 1, 2007, the Company recognized an
    increase in deferred tax assets of $3.0 million related to
    previously unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as
    an increase to additional paid-in capital of $0.3 million
    and an increase in accrued expenses of $2.7 million.

Stockholders’
    Equity

Common
    Stock

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had
    110,000,000 authorized shares of common stock and 10,000,000
    authorized shares of non-voting common stock. Common stock
    entitles the holder to one vote per share of common stock held.
    Non-voting common stock is convertible on a

one-for-one

basis into shares of voting common stock at any time subject to
    a limitation on conversion to the extent such conversion would
    result in a stockholder, together with its affiliates, owning
    more than 9.99% of the outstanding shares of common stock.
    During 2007, a total of 539,725 shares of non-voting common
    stock were converted to voting common stock.

In October 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company
    authorized a share repurchase program for up to
    $40.0 million of common stock. Shares repurchased under the
    program are held in treasury for future use. During 2008 and
    2007, a total of 221,406 shares and 2,452,214 shares
    were repurchased at a cost of $2.8 million and
    $34.6 million, respectively. The share repurchase program
    was completed in January 2008. A total of 2,864,120 shares
    were repurchased at an aggregate cost of $40.0 million over
    the life of the repurchase program.

Common
    Stock Subscribed

In 2001, the Company awarded 289,581 shares to the
    Company’s Chief Executive Officer at $3.60 per share, which
    vested over a three-year period. The common stock subscribed was
    issued in 2001 in exchange for four eleven-year promissory notes
    that bear interest at the applicable federal rate and are
    collateralized by the subscribed shares.

Warrants

In April 2000, the Board of Directors initiated a warrant
    program that commenced on February 1, 2001. Under this
    program, the Company reserved for issuance 5,000,002 shares
    of common stock. The warrants were issued to holders of
    Series A, C, E and I redeemable convertible preferred stock
    (the “Warrant Holders”). The Warrant Holders were
    entitled to purchase shares of common stock from the Company at
    an exercise price of $.003. The warrants were issued to the
    Warrant Holders at the time that they made an equity investment
    in the Company. Allocations were based on each broker-dealer
    client’s respective commissions as a percentage of the
    total commissions from the six participating Warrant Holders,
    calculated on a quarterly basis. The final share allocations
    under the warrant program occurred on March 1, 2004. Shares
    allocated under the warrant program were expensed

on a quarterly basis at fair market value. During the year ended
    December 31, 2007, two Stockholder Broker-Dealer Clients
    converted 2,379,200 warrants into 2,378,764 shares of
    common stock through non-cash exercises. Upon such exercises, no
    further warrants were outstanding.

Series B
    Preferred Stock and Warrants

On June 2, 2008, the Company entered into a Securities
    Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with two
    funds managed by Technology Crossover Ventures (the
    “Purchasers”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to
    issue and sell to the Purchasers (i) 35,000 shares of
    the Company’s Series B Preferred Stock, which shares
    are convertible into an aggregate of 3,500,000 shares of
    common stock and (ii) warrants (the “Warrants”
    and, together with the Series B Preferred Stock, the
    “Securities”) to purchase an aggregate of
    700,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of
    $10.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of
    $35.0 million. The Securities were purchased in two
    tranches on June 3, 2008 and July 14, 2008, with the
    first tranche representing 28,000 shares of Series B
    Preferred Stock and Warrants to purchase 560,000 shares of
    common stock for an aggregate purchase price of
    $28.0 million, and the second tranche representing the
    remainder of the Securities for an aggregate purchase price of
    $7.0 million. The net proceeds, after the placement agent
    fee and legal fees, were $26.8 million for the first
    tranche and $6.8 million for the second tranche.

The Purchasers have the right to nominate one director to the
    Board of Directors of the Company if they beneficially own at
    least 1,750,000 shares of common stock. The Purchasers also
    have registration rights that require the Company, within six
    months after the closing date, to file a registration statement
    with the SEC to register the resale of the shares of common
    stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred
    Stock and upon exercise of the Warrants (collectively, the
    “Registrable Shares”), and to cause such registration
    statement to become effective under the Securities Act of 1933,
    as amended, no later than 12 months after the closing. On
    January 22, 2009, a registration statement on

Form S-3

registered the resale of the Registrable Shares was declared
    effective by the SEC. The Company has also agreed to provide the
    Purchasers with piggyback registration rights on certain public
    offerings of securities by the Company.

The purchase price of the Series B Preferred Stock was
    $1,000.00 per share (the “Original Series B Issue
    Price”). In the event of a Liquidation Event (as such term
    is defined in the Series B Certificate of Designation),
    each holder of the Series B Preferred Stock is entitled to
    receive, prior to any distribution to the holders of the common
    stock, the greater of (i) an amount per share of
    Series B Preferred Stock equal to the Original
    Series B Issue Price, plus any declared but unpaid
    dividends thereon, and (ii) the amount such holder would
    have received in connection with the Liquidation Event if the
    holder held the number of shares of common stock issuable upon
    conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock then held by
    such holder.

The shares of Series B Preferred Stock are convertible at
    any time by the holders thereof at a conversion price of $10.00
    per share, subject to anti-dilution adjustments in the event of
    a stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock split or similar
    transaction. The Series B Preferred Stock will be
    automatically converted into shares of common stock at the
    then-applicable conversion price if at any time after
    June 3, 2009 (the first anniversary of the original
    issuance of the Series B Preferred Stock), the closing
    price of the common stock is at least $17.50 on each trading day
    for a period of 65 consecutive trading days.

The Series B Preferred Stock includes a dividend right
    whereby, upon the declaration or payment of a dividend or
    distribution on the common stock, a dividend or distribution
    must also be declared or paid on the Series B Preferred
    Stock based on the number of shares of common stock into which
    such shares of Series B Preferred Stock would be
    convertible at the time. The holders of the Series B
    Preferred Stock also have voting rights equal to the aggregate
    number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of
    such holders’ shares of Series B Preferred Stock.

As discussed above, the Warrants entitle the Purchasers to
    purchase an aggregate of 700,000 shares of common stock at
    an exercise price of $10.00 per share. The Warrants may be
    exercised for cash or on a net exercise basis. The



MARKETAXESS
    HOLDINGS INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Warrants expire on the tenth anniversary of the date they were
    first issued and are subject to customary anti-dilution
    adjustments in the event of stock splits, reverse stock splits,
    stock dividends and similar transactions. The net proceeds from
    the issuance have been allocated to the Series B Preferred
    Stock and Warrants based on their relative fair value on the
    respective closing dates and resulted in $3.2 million being
    allocated to the Warrants. The fair value of the Warrants was
    computed using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

The Series B Preferred Stock does not contain an
    unconditional obligation requiring the Company to redeem the
    shares at a specified date or upon the occurrence of an event
    certain. While liability classification does not apply, there
    are certain liquidation scenarios not solely within the
    Company’s control. Therefore, the portion of the net
    proceeds attributable to the Series B Preferred Stock is
    not classified as permanent equity. The Series B Preferred
    Stock is not being accreted to its redemption value since the
    occurrence of a redemption event is not considered probable.

Dividends

Prior to 2009, the Company retained all earnings for investment
    in its business. In October 2009, the Company’s Board of
    Directors approved a regular quarterly dividend. The first
    quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share was paid to holders
    of common stock outstanding or issuable upon conversion of
    outstanding shares of non-voting common stock and Series B
    Preferred Stock in November 2009 and a quarterly cash dividend
    of $0.07 per share will be paid on March 3, 2010 to such
    stockholders of record as of the close of business on
    February 17, 2010. Any future declaration and payment of
    dividends will be at the sole discretion of the Company’s
    Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may take into account
    such matters as general business conditions, the Company’s
    financial results, capital requirements, contractual, legal, and
    regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends to the
    Company’s stockholders or by the Company’s
    subsidiaries to the parent and any such other factors as the
    Board of Directors may deem relevant.

Stockholder
    Rights Agreement

On June 2, 2008, the Board of Directors adopted and the
    Company’s stockholders subsequently ratified a stockholders
    rights agreement and declared a distribution of one right (a
    “Right”) for each outstanding share of common stock
    and non-voting common stock, to stockholders of record at the
    close of business on June 20, 2008 and for each share of
    common stock and non-voting common stock issued by the Company
    thereafter and prior to the Distribution Date (as defined in the
    stockholders rights agreement). Each Right entitles the
    registered holder, subject to the terms of the stockholders
    rights agreement, to purchase from the Company one
    one-thousandth of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, par
    value $0.001 per share (a “Unit), at a price of $40.00 per
    Unit, subject to adjustment.

12.

Stock-Based
    Compensation Plans

The Company has three stock incentive plans which provide for
    the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights,
    restricted stock, performance shares, performance units, or
    other stock-based awards as incentives and rewards to encourage
    employees, consultants and non-employee directors to participate
    in the long-term success of the Company. On June 7, 2006,
    stockholder approval was obtained for an amendment and
    restatement of the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan to, among other
    things, increase the number of shares authorized for issuance
    under the plan from 3,084,802 to 9,754,802 shares. As of
    December 31, 2009, there were 4,924,500 shares
    available for grant under the stock incentive plans.

Stock
    Options

The exercise price of each option granted is equal to the market
    price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.
    Generally, option grants have provided for vesting over a
    three-year period. Options expire ten years from the date of
    grant.

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The
    determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the
    date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by the
    Company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a
    number of highly complex and subjective variables, including the
    expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, the
    risk-free interest rate and the expected term. Expected
    volatilities are based on historical volatility of the
    Company’s stock and a peer group. The risk-free interest
    rate is based on U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity
    value approximating the expected term of the option. The
    expected term represents the period of time that options granted
    are expected to be outstanding based on actual and projected
    employee stock option exercise behavior.

The following table represents the assumptions used for the
    Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the per share
    weighted-average fair value for options granted for the three

Performance
    Shares

During 2009 and 2008, the Company granted performance share
    awards to certain senior managers. Each performance share award
    is earned or forfeited based on the level of achievement by the
    Company of pre-tax operating income on a per share basis before
    performance share and cash bonus expense. The pay-out ranges
    from zero to 150% of the performance share award. For each
    performance share earned, a participant is awarded an equal
    number of shares of restricted stock. Any restricted stock
    awarded to a participant vests and ceases to be restricted stock
    in two equal installments on each of the second and third
    anniversaries of the date of grant of the applicable performance
    share award. The Company failed to meet the pre-tax operating
    income per share target for 2008 and, accordingly, all of the
    performance share awards were forfeited. For 2009, the pay-out
    achievement was 150% of the performance award. The following

Commitments
    and Contingencies

The Company leases office space and equipment under
    non-cancelable lease agreements expiring at various dates
    through 2022. Office space leases are subject to escalation
    based on certain costs incurred by the landlord. Minimum rental
    commitments under such operating and capital leases, net of
    sublease income, are as follows:

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Rental expense for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008
    and 2007 was $2.7 million, $2.4 million and
    $2.2 million, respectively, and is included in occupancy
    expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Rental
    expense has been recorded based on the total minimum lease
    payments after giving effect to rent abatement and concessions,
    which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the life
    of the lease, and sublease income.

The Company has entered into a sublease agreement on one of its
    leased properties through the April 2011 lease termination date.
    In May 2008, the Company assigned the lease agreement on another
    leased property to a third party. The Company is contingently
    liable should the assignee default on future lease obligations
    through the November 2015 lease termination date. The aggregate
    amount of future lease obligations under these two arrangements
    is $3.7 million as of December 31, 2009.

The Company is contingently obligated for standby letters of
    credit that were issued to landlords for office space. The
    Company uses a U.S. government obligation as collateral for
    these standby letters of credit. This collateral is included
    with securities and cash provided as collateral in the
    Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and had a fair
    market value as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 of
    $3.5 million and $3.3 million, respectively.

MarketAxess Corporation executes certain bond transactions
    between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer
    clients on a riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty
    to both the buyer and the seller in matching

back-to-back

trades, which are then settled through a third-party clearing
    organization. MarketAxess Corporation acts as intermediary on a
    riskless principal basis in these bond transactions by serving
    as counterparty to the two clients involved. Settlement
    typically occurs within one to three trading days after the
    trade date. Cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon
    receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was
    traded. Under a securities clearing agreement with the
    independent third party, MarketAxess Corporation maintains a
    collateral deposit with the clearing broker in the form of cash.
    As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the collateral deposit
    included in securities and cash provided as collateral in the
    Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition was
    $0.5 million. MarketAxess Corporation is exposed to credit
    risk in the event a counterparty does not fulfill its obligation
    to complete a transaction. Pursuant to the terms of the
    securities clearing agreement between MarketAxess Corporation
    and the independent clearing broker, the clearing broker has the
    right to charge MarketAxess Corporation for losses resulting
    from a counterparty’s failure to fulfill its contractual
    obligations. The losses are not capped at a maximum amount and
    apply to all trades executed through the clearing broker. At
    December 31, 2009, MarketAxess Corporation had not recorded
    any liabilities with regard to this right.

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into
    contracts that contain a variety of representations, warranties
    and general indemnifications. The Company’s maximum
    exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would
    involve future claims that may be made against the Company that
    have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the Company
    expects the risk of loss to be remote.

In January 2007, a former employee of MarketAxess Corporation
    commenced an arbitration proceeding before FINRA arising out of
    the May 2006 termination of such individual’s employment
    with MarketAxess Corporation. This individual subsequently
    amended his statement of claim to add the Company as a party to
    the arbitration proceeding. FINRA consolidated all of the former
    employee’s claims into a single proceeding.

The former employee alleges that the Company acted wrongfully as
    a result of, and in connection with, the decision by the
    Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors
    not to accede to the employee’s demand for alteration of
    the terms of certain stock option and restricted stock
    agreements in order to award the employee additional rights and
    benefits upon the termination of his employment,

i.e.

,
    accelerated vesting of all of his then unvested options and
    shares of restricted stock and waiver of the

90-day

time
    period within which he was contractually required to exercise
    his vested options. This former employee further alleges that he
    is entitled to a bonus for the approximately five months that he
    worked for MarketAxess Corporation during 2006. The alleged
    damages sought by the claimant total approximately
    $0.9 million, plus statutory interest, and an unstated
    amount of punitive damages, costs and expenses.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The FINRA hearing, originally scheduled for February 2009, was
    further postponed in September 2009 and February 2010. New
    hearing dates have not yet been established. The Company
    believes that these claims are wholly without merit and has
    vigorously defended against them. Based on currently available
    information, the Company believes that the likelihood of a
    material loss is not probable. Accordingly, no amount has been
    provided in the accompanying financial statements. However,
    arbitration is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable
    rulings could occur.

15.

Segment
    Information

As an electronic multi-dealer platform for the trading of
    fixed-income securities, the Company’s operations
    constitute a single business segment. Because of the highly
    integrated nature of the financial markets in which the Company
    competes and the integration of the Company’s worldwide
    business activities, the Company believes that results by
    geographic region or client sector are not necessarily
    meaningful in understanding its business.

16.

Retirement
    Savings Plans

The Company, through its U.S. and U.K. subsidiaries, offers
    its employees the opportunity to invest in defined contribution
    plans. For the years ending December 31, 2009, 2008 and
    2007, the Company contributed $0.6 million,
    $0.4 million and $0.6 million, respectively, to the
    plans.

17.

Customer
    Concentration

During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, no
    single client accounted for more than 10% of total revenue. One
    institutional investor client accounted for 12.1%, 10.8% and
    12.2% of trading volumes during the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

    submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
