PART I

Forward-Looking
    Statements

This report contains certain “forward-looking
    statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities
    Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be
    identified by words such as “expects,”
    “intends,” “anticipates,” “plans,”
    “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,”
    “will,” or words of similar meaning and include, but
    are not limited to, statements regarding the outlook for our
    future business and financial performance. Forward-looking
    statements are based on management’s current expectations
    and assumptions, which are subject to inherent uncertainties,
    risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to
    predict. It is routine for our internal projections and
    expectations to change as the year or each quarter in the year
    progresses, and therefore it should be clearly understood that
    the internal projections and beliefs upon which we base our
    expectations may change prior to the end of each quarter or the
    year. Although these expectations may change, we are under no
    obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements
    contained in this report. Our company policy is generally to
    provide our expectations only once per quarter, and not to
    update that information until the next quarter. Actual future
    events or results may differ, perhaps materially, from those
    contained in the projections or forward-looking statements.
    Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences
    include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report,
    particularly in Item 1A., “Risk Factors.”

Item 1.

Business

MarketAxess operates one of the leading platforms for the
    electronic trading of corporate bonds and certain other types of
    fixed-income securities. Through our platform, 674 active
    institutional investor client firms (firms that executed at
    least one trade through our electronic trading platform between
    January 2007 and December 2007) can access the aggregate
    liquidity provided by the collective interest of our 30
    broker-dealer clients in buying or selling bonds through our
    platform. Our active institutional investor clients include
    investment advisers, mutual funds, insurance companies, public
    and private pension funds, bank portfolios and hedge funds. We
    provide data and analytical tools that help our clients make
    trading decisions, we provide connectivity solutions that
    facilitate the trading process by electronically communicating
    order information between trading counterparties and we provide
    our clients with ancillary technology services. Our revenues are
    primarily generated from the trading of U.S. and European
    high-grade corporate bonds.

Our multi-dealer request for quote (“RFQ”) trading
    platform allows our institutional investor clients to
    simultaneously request competing, executable bids or offers from
    our broker-dealer clients and execute trades with the
    broker-dealer of their choice from among those that choose to
    respond. We offer our broker-dealer clients a solution that
    enables them to efficiently reach our institutional investor
    clients for the distribution and trading of bonds. In addition
    to U.S. high-grade corporate bonds, European high-grade
    corporate bonds and emerging markets bonds, including both
    investment-grade and non-investment grade debt, we also offer
    our clients the ability to trade crossover and high-yield bonds,
    agency bonds and credit default swaps (“CDS”). Our
    DealerAxess

®

anonymous cross-matching trading service allows dealers to trade
    fixed-income securities and credit default swaps with each other
    on our platform.

The majority of our revenues are derived from monthly
    distribution fees and commissions for trades executed on our
    platform that are billed to our broker-dealer clients on a
    monthly basis. We also derive revenues from information and user
    access fees, license fees, investment income and other income,
    which includes fees earned from our technology services
    business. Our expenses consist of employee compensation and
    benefits, depreciation and amortization, technology and
    communication expenses, professional and consulting fees,
    occupancy, marketing and advertising and general and
    administrative expenses.

Traditionally, bond trading has been a manual process, with
    product and price discovery conducted over the telephone between
    two or more parties. This traditional process has a number of
    shortcomings resulting primarily from the lack of a central
    trading facility for these securities, which creates difficulty
    matching buyers and sellers for particular issues. In recent
    years, an increasing number of corporate bond trading
    participants have utilized

e-mail

and
    other electronic means of communication for trading corporate
    bonds. While this has addressed some of the shortcomings
    associated with traditional corporate bond trading, we believe
    that the process is still hindered by



limited liquidity, limited price transparency, significant
    transaction costs, compliance and regulatory challenges, and
    difficulty in executing numerous trades at one time.

Through our disclosed multi-dealer RFQ platform, our
    institutional investor clients can determine prices available
    for a security, a process called price discovery, as well as
    trade securities directly with our broker-dealer clients. The
    price discovery process includes the ability to view indicative
    prices from the broker-dealer clients’ inventory available
    on our platform, access to real-time pricing information and
    analytical tools (including spread-to-Treasury data, search
    capabilities and independent third-party credit research)
    available on our Corporate
    BondTicker

TM

service and the ability to request executable bids and offers
    simultaneously from up to 22 of our broker-dealer clients during
    the trade process. On average, institutional investor clients
    receive several bids or offers from broker-dealer clients in
    response to trade inquiries. However, some trade inquiries may
    not receive any bids or offers. Our services relating to trade
    execution include single and multiple-dealer inquiries; list
    trading, which is the ability to request bids and offers on
    multiple bonds at the same time; and swap trading, which is the
    ability to request an offer to purchase one bond and a bid to
    sell another bond, in a manner such that the two trades will be
    executed simultaneously, with payment based on the price
    differential of the bonds. Once a trade is completed on our
    platform, the broker-dealer client and institutional investor
    client may settle the trade with the assistance of our automated
    post-trade messaging, which facilitates the communication of
    trade acknowledgment and allocation information between our
    institutional investor and broker-dealer clients. We are not a
    party to the actual trades that occur on our platform between
    institutional investor clients and broker-dealer clients;
    rather, we serve as an intermediary between broker-dealers and
    institutional investors, enabling them to meet, agree on a price
    and then transact with each other.

Our
    DealerAxess

®

anonymous cross-matching service, which we introduced in June
    2006, allows our broker-dealer clients to transact
    U.S. corporate and emerging markets bond and CDS trades on
    our platform with other broker-dealer clients. Our broker-dealer
    clients can execute these trades in a more efficient manner and
    at lower transaction costs than in the traditional
    voice-brokered inter-dealer market. Although
    DealerAxess

®

is a completely segregated trading platform, it shares the same
    core technology as our client-to-dealer platform. MarketAxess
    Corporation, our U.S. subsidiary, acts as intermediary on a
    riskless principal basis in bond transactions between
    broker-dealer clients by serving as counterparty to the two
    broker-dealer clients involved. CDS transactions are conducted
    on the
    DealerAxess

®

platform on a name

give-up

basis and are directly settled between the two trading
    counterparties.

Our client base includes 30 of the leading broker-dealers in
    global fixed-income trading and 674 active institutional
    investor firms (firms that executed at least one trade through
    our electronic trading platform between January 2007 and
    December 2007). Our broker-dealer clients accounted for
    approximately 98% of the underwriting of newly-issued
    U.S. high-grade corporate bonds and approximately 82% of
    the underwriting of newly issued European high-grade corporate
    bonds in 2007. We believe these broker-dealers also represent
    the principal source of secondary market liquidity in the other
    markets in which we operate. Secondary market liquidity refers
    to the ability of market participants to buy or sell a security
    quickly and in large volume subsequent to the original issuance
    of the security, without substantially affecting the price of
    the security. Our broker-dealer clients currently trade
    fixed-income securities by traditional means including
    telephone,

e-mail

and
    proprietary single-dealer systems in addition to our electronic
    trading platform and we expect them to continue to do so in the
    future. We believe that these traditional means of trading
    remain the manner in which the majority of bonds are traded
    between institutional investors and broker-dealers. Our volume
    in U.S. high-grade corporate bonds represented
    approximately 9.4% of the total U.S. high-grade corporate
    bond volume, excluding convertible bonds, for 2007 as reported
    by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
    (“FINRA”) Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine
    (“TRACE”), which includes inter-dealer and retail
    trading as well as trading between institutional investors and
    broker-dealers. We have not identified a reliable source of data
    relating to either the total volume of client-to-dealer trading
    or the size of the other markets we serve and therefore are
    unable to accurately determine the total volume of secondary
    trading of these bonds or the portion of such trading conducted
    on our platform.



Company
    History

MarketAxess was formed in April 2000, and pilot trading on our
    fully disclosed multi-dealer platform began in October 2000. We
    launched trading on our electronic platform in January 2001 with
    eight broker-dealer clients. In March 2001, we acquired Trading
    Edge, Inc. (“Trading Edge”), the operator of an
    anonymous trading platform for U.S. corporate bonds,
    convertible bonds, municipal bonds and emerging markets bonds.
    The technology platform developed by Trading Edge and obtained
    by us through the acquisition is now the core of our product
    offerings. In August 2001, one of our U.K. subsidiaries,
    MarketAxess Europe Limited, began operations with secondary
    electronic trading in U.S. dollar-denominated and
    Euro-denominated corporate bonds. We launched our information
    service, Corporate
    BondTicker

TM

in July 2002. Corporate
    BondTicker

TM

combines FINRA TRACE data with MarketAxess data and analytical
    tools to provide trading professionals, research firms, rating
    and news agencies, and other market participants with a
    comprehensive set of corporate bond information. On
    November 4, 2004, we completed the initial public offering
    of our common stock. In November 2007, we formed a new
    subsidiary, MarketAxess Technologies Inc., which acquired
    certain assets and assumed certain obligations of Trade West
    Systems, LLC (“TWS”). TWS is a Utah-based financial
    software and technology services provider focused on providing
    gateway adapters for connecting order management systems and
    trading systems to fixed-income trading venues.

Industry
    Background

Fixed-income securities are issued by corporations, governments
    and other entities, and pay a pre-set absolute or relative rate
    of return. As of December 31, 2007, there were
    approximately $29.2 trillion of fixed-income securities
    outstanding in the U.S. market, including $5.7 trillion of
    U.S. corporate bonds. We are primarily active in six
    segments of the credit markets within the global fixed-income
    securities market: U.S. high-grade corporate bonds;
    European high-grade corporate bonds; emerging markets bonds;
    crossover and high-yield bonds; agency bonds; and CDS.

The second half of 2007 was a period of significant turmoil in
    the U.S. and European credit markets, especially in
    short-term funding and floating rate note instruments. A
    widespread retrenchment in the credit markets resulted in
    increased credit spreads and significantly higher credit spread
    volatility across a wide range of asset classes. The average
    daily trading volume of U.S. high-grade corporate bonds for
    the second half of 2007 decreased by 14% compared to the second
    half of 2006. We believe the resultant lack of liquidity in the
    credit markets led institutional investors to reduce overall
    bond trading activity and conduct a higher percentage of their
    trades directly with their broker-dealer counterparties,
    resulting in lower volumes on our platform. We also believe that
    a stabilization in credit market conditions, at higher overall
    levels of credit spreads, is likely to favorably impact the
    volume of trades conducted over our platform.

U.S.
    High-Grade Corporate Bond Market

The total amount of U.S. corporate bonds outstanding has
    grown from $3.0 trillion as of December 31, 1999 to $5.7
    trillion as of December 31, 2007. The average daily trading
    volume of U.S. corporate bonds (investment grade and high
    yield) has decreased from approximately $17.9 billion in
    2002 (the first calendar year for which such data are available)
    to $13.2 billion in 2007. We believe that this decline in
    average daily trading volumes is due to cyclical credit market
    conditions and the growth of debt instruments going into
    structured product instruments.

The U.S. corporate bond market consists of three broad
    categories of securities: investment-grade debt

(so-called

“high-grade”), which typically refers to debt rated
    BBB- or better by Standard & Poor’s or Baa3 or
    better by Moody’s Investor Service; debt rated below
    investment-grade (so-called “high-yield”), which
    typically refers to debt rated lower than BBB- by
    Standard & Poor’s or Baa3 by Moody’s
    Investor Service; and debt convertible into equity (so-called
    “convertible debt”).



The U.S. high-grade corporate bond market, which represents
    the largest subset of the U.S. corporate bond market, has
    undergone significant change over the last several years, which
    has been driven by a number of factors, including:

•

Improved price transparency

— In 2002, FINRA
    adopted TRACE reporting, which requires FINRA members to report
    secondary market transactions in certain fixed-income securities
    to the FINRA. Since February 2005, the list of TRACE-eligible
    bonds has included 23,000 unique securities, representing 99% of
    the daily trading volume of high-grade bonds.

•

Introduction of electronic trading platforms

—
    Electronic trading platforms, which are in the early stages of
    adoption, act as central facilities to bring together buyers and
    sellers. The actions of participants on these platforms are
    facilitated by an electronic medium that improves some of the
    manual processes that might otherwise be required, such as
    searching for securities with specific characteristics, the
    coordination of multiple bilateral telephone calls or electronic
    communications, the sorting and analysis of competing bids or
    offers, and the entry of orders into the trading system after
    verbal or

e-mail

trade
    agreement. As a result, these platforms typically provide a
    lower-cost and more efficient means of enhanced distribution and
    trade execution than previously possible.

•

Introduction of credit derivatives

— Credit
    derivatives provide increased flexibility and liquidity for
    investors and lenders to diversify their credit exposures. The
    appeal of these products is apparent in the growth in the total
    notional amount of outstanding CDS. According to the
    International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.
    (“ISDA”), the total notional amount of CDS outstanding
    grew from approximately $900 billion at December 31,
    2001 to approximately $46 trillion at June 30, 2007.

•

Growth in the total amount of debt
    outstanding

— The total size of the
    U.S. high-grade corporate bond market has increased
    significantly since 1998, when approximately $564 billion
    gross amount of new bonds were issued. By 2007, the amount of
    gross corporate issuance had grown to $1,114.4 billion, as
    illustrated in the chart below:



European
    High-Grade Corporate Bond Market

The European high-grade corporate bond market consists of a
    broad range of products, issuers and currencies. We define the
    European high-grade corporate bond market generally to consist
    of bonds intended to be distributed to European investors,
    primarily bonds issued by European corporations, excluding bonds
    that are issued by a corporation domiciled in an emerging
    markets country and excluding most government bonds that trade
    in Europe. Examples include:

•

bonds issued by European corporations, denominated in any
    currency;

•

bonds generally denominated in Euros, U.S. dollars or
    Pounds Sterling, excluding bonds that are issued by a
    corporation domiciled in an emerging market;

•

bonds issued by supra-national organizations (entities that
    include a number of central banks or government financial
    authorities, such as the World Bank), agencies and governments
    located in Europe, generally denominated in Euros,
    U.S. dollars or Pounds Sterling, provided that such
    currency is not the currency of the country where the bond was
    issued; and

•

floating-rate notes issued by European corporations.

We believe that the European high-grade corporate bond market is
    impacted by many of the same factors as the U.S. high-grade
    corporate bond market. In addition, we believe the following
    factors are unique to the European high-grade corporate bond
    market:

•

Adoption of the Euro

— The adoption of the Euro
    as the common currency in most European Union countries has
    reduced the importance of currency as an investment selection
    criterion and elevated the importance of the credit risk of
    particular issuers. As a result, institutional investors have
    exhibited a greater interest in investing in a broader range of
    bonds issued by entities domiciled outside of their home
    countries.

•

Regulatory environment

— Certain European Union
    countries have eased restrictions that required institutional
    investors to invest primarily in domestic securities. This has
    provided European institutional investors with increased
    flexibility to invest in securities issued by entities domiciled
    in other countries within the European Union. On
    November 1, 2007, the Markets in Financial Instruments
    Directive (“MiFID”) came into effect. MiFID is
    designed to further harmonize the financial markets of the
    member states of the European Union and introduces new pre- and
    post-trade transparency requirements.

•

Common liquidity pool

— The larger capital pool
    created by the common currency and changes in the regulatory
    environment have enabled European corporations to offer larger
    issues, which has resulted in increases in the liquidity and
    trading volumes of these issues. This has attracted even more
    institutional investors, who prefer to invest in highly-liquid
    markets.

Emerging
    Markets Bond Market

We define the emerging markets bond market generally to include
    U.S. dollar, Euro or local currency denominated bonds
    issued by sovereign entities or corporations domiciled in a
    developing country. These issuers are typically located in Latin
    America, Asia, or Central and Eastern Europe. Examples of
    countries we classify as emerging markets include: Brazil,
    Colombia, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Turkey and
    Venezuela.

The institutional investor base for emerging markets bonds has
    recently expanded to include many crossover investors from the
    high-yield and high-grade investment areas. Institutional
    investors have been drawn to emerging markets bonds by their
    high returns and high growth potential, as well as by a general
    trend toward positive economic and political reforms and
    improving economic performance in many emerging markets
    countries.

Crossover
    and High-Yield Bond Market

We define the high-yield bond market generally to include all
    debt rated lower than BBB- by Standard & Poor’s
    or Baa3 by Moody’s Investor Service. We define the
    crossover market to include any debt issue rated below
    investment grade by one agency but investment grade by the
    other. The total amount of high-yield corporate bonds



yearly issuance has grown from $130.9 billion for the year
    ended December 31, 2003 to approximately
    $136.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007.

FINRA began publicly disseminating real-time price information
    on approximately 12,000 high-yield corporate bond issues in
    2005. Trades in bonds rated BB and lower are subject to
    immediate dissemination if the trade size is less than
    $1 million, or greater than $1 million and trades an
    average of once or more a day. The disseminated set was expanded
    on February 1, 2005 to include reporting of certain
    transactions on a delayed basis. The average daily trading
    volume of high-yield bonds reported by FINRA for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 was $4.2 billion.

Agency
    Bond Market

We define the agency bond market to include debt issued by a
    U.S. government-sponsored agency. Some prominent issuers of
    agency bonds are the Student Loan Marketing Association
    (“Sallie Mae”), Federal National Mortgage Association
    (“Fannie Mae”) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage
    Corporation (“Freddie Mac”). The total amount of
    U.S. agency bonds outstanding has grown from $1.9 trillion
    as of December 31, 2000 to $2.9 trillion as of
    December 31, 2007. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York
    reported average daily trading volume in federal agency and
    government sponsored enterprise securities (excluding
    mortgage-backed securities) for 2007 of $17.2 billion.

Credit
    Default Swap Market

Credit default swaps are contracts on an underlying asset that
    transfer risk and return from one party to another without
    transferring ownership of the underlying asset, allowing market
    participants to obtain credit protection or assume credit
    exposure associated with a broad range of issuers of
    fixed-income securities and other debt obligations. They are
    often designed to hedge other exposures and can be tied to
    particular events, such as a default, bankruptcy or ratings
    downgrade. CDS provide increased flexibility and liquidity for
    investors and lenders to diversify their credit risk.
    Approximately half of the volume traded in CDS is index
    products, which give exposure to a defined basket of underlying
    CDS. The remainder is traded in single-name CDS. The appeal of
    these products is apparent in the growth in the total notional
    amount of outstanding CDS, as illustrated in the chart below:



Our
    Competitive Strengths

Our electronic trading platform provides solutions to some of
    the shortcomings of traditional bond trading methods. The
    benefits of our solution are demonstrable throughout the trading
    cycle:

•

Pre-trade

— gathering real-time and historical
    pricing information, identifying interested buyers and sellers
    in a particular security, and obtaining research and analysis;

•

Trade

— single and multiple security trade
    execution; and

•

Post-trade

— trade detail matching, account
    allocation and automated audit trail.

We believe that we are well positioned to strengthen our market
    position in electronic trading in our existing products and to
    extend our presence into new products and services by
    capitalizing on our competitive strengths, including:

Significant
    Trading Volumes with Participation by Leading Broker-Dealers and
    Institutional Investors

Our electronic trading platform provides access to the liquidity
    provided through the participation on our platform of 30 of the
    leading global securities broker-dealers and 674 active
    institutional investor firms (firms that executed at least one
    trade through our electronic trading platform between January
    2007 and December 2007). We believe these broker-dealers
    represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity for
    U.S. high-grade corporate bonds, European high-grade
    corporate bonds, emerging markets bonds and the other markets in
    which we operate. Our broker-dealer clients are motivated to
    continue to utilize our platform due to the presence on the
    platform of our large network of institutional investor clients.
    We believe that if we continue to grow the participation of our
    broker-dealer and institutional investor clients on our
    electronic trading platform, the benefits in liquidity on the
    platform to both broker-dealers and institutional investors will
    be amplified, further motivating them to use our platform. The
    number of our active institutional investor clients for the past
    five years has been as follows:



Our total trading volume has grown over the past five years as
    indicated below:

Our volume in U.S. high-grade corporate bonds grew from
    approximately 6.4% of total U.S. high-grade corporate bond
    volume, excluding convertible bonds, in 2004 as reported by
    FINRA TRACE, which includes inter-dealer and retail trading as
    well as trading between institutional investors and
    broker-dealers, to approximately 9.4% in 2007, as shown in the
    chart below:

We have not identified a reliable source of data relating to
    either the total volume of client-to-dealer trading or the size
    of the other markets we serve and therefore we are unable to
    accurately determine the total volume of secondary trading of
    these bonds or the portion of such trading conducted on our
    platform.



Execution
    Benefits to Clients

Benefits
    to Institutional Investor Clients

We believe we provide numerous benefits to our institutional
    investor clients over traditional fixed-income trading methods,
    including:

Competitive Prices.

By enabling institutional
    investors to simultaneously request bids or offers from our
    broker-dealer clients, we believe our electronic trading
    platform creates an environment that motivates our broker-dealer
    clients to provide competitive prices and gives institutional
    investors confidence that they are obtaining a competitive
    price. For typical MarketAxess multi-dealer corporate bond
    inquiries, the range of competitive

spread-to-Treasury

responses is, on average, approximately 10 basis points (a
    basis point is 1/100 of 1% in yield). As an example of the
    potential cost savings to institutional investors, a one basis
    point savings on a $1 million face amount trade of a bond
    with 10 years to maturity translates to aggregate savings
    of approximately $750.00.

Transparent Pricing on a Range of
    Securities.

The commingled multi-dealer inventory
    of bonds posted by our broker-dealer clients on our platform
    consists of a daily average of more than $120 billion in
    indicative bids and offers. Subject to applicable regulatory
    requirements, institutional investors can search bonds in
    inventory based on any combination of issuer, issue, rating,
    maturity, spread-to-Treasury, size and dealer providing the
    listing, in a fraction of the time it takes to do so manually.
    Institutional investor clients can also request executable bids
    and offers on our electronic trading platform on any debt
    security in a database of U.S. and European corporate
    bonds, although there can be no assurance as to the number of
    broker-dealers who will choose to provide an executable price.
    Our platform transmits bid and offer requests in real-time to
    broker-dealer clients, who may respond with executable prices
    within a time period specified by the investor.

Improved Cost Efficiency.

We believe that we
    provide improved efficiency by reducing the time and labor
    required to conduct broad product and price discovery.
    Single-security and multi-security (bid or offer lists)
    inquiries can be efficiently conducted with multiple
    broker-dealers. In addition, our Corporate
    BondTicker

TM

eliminates the need for manually-intensive phone calls or

e-mail

communication to gather, sort and analyze information concerning
    historical transaction prices.

Benefits
    to Broker-Dealer Clients

We also provide substantial benefits to our broker-dealer
    clients over traditional fixed-income trading methods, including:

Greater Sales Efficiency.

We offer our
    broker-dealer clients broad connectivity with their
    institutional investor clients. Through this connectivity, our
    broker-dealer clients are able to efficiently display their
    indications of interest to buy and sell various securities. We
    also enable broker-dealers to broaden their distribution by
    participating in transactions to which they otherwise may not
    have had access. In addition, the ability to post prices and
    electronically execute on straightforward trades enables bond
    sales professionals at broker-dealer firms to focus their
    efforts on more profitable activities, such as higher
    value-added trades and more complex transactions.

More Efficient Inventory Management.

The
    posting of inventory to, and the ability to respond to inquiries
    from, a broad pool of institutional investors, creates an
    increased opportunity for broker-dealers to identify demand for
    their inventory, particularly in less liquid securities. As a
    result, we believe they can achieve enhanced bond inventory
    turnover, which may limit credit exposure.

Benefits
    to Both Institutional Investor and Broker-Dealer
    Clients

We offer additional benefits over traditional fixed-income
    trading methods that are shared by both institutional investor
    and broker-dealer clients, including:

Greater Trading Accuracy.

Our electronic
    trading platform includes verification mechanisms at various
    stages of the execution process which result in greater accuracy
    in the processing, confirming and clearing of trades between
    institutional investor and broker-dealer clients. These
    verification mechanisms are designed to ensure that our
    broker-dealer and institutional investor clients are sending
    accurate trade messages by providing multiple opportunities to
    verify they are trading the correct bond, at the

agreed-upon

price and size. Our platform assists our



institutional investor clients in automating the transmittal of
    order tickets from the portfolio manager to the trader, and from
    the trader to back-office personnel. This automation provides
    more timely execution and a reduction in the likelihood of
    errors that can result from information being manually entered
    into different systems.

Efficient Risk Monitoring and
    Compliance.

Institutional investors and their
    regulators are increasingly focused on ensuring that best
    execution is achieved for fixed-income trades. Our electronic
    trading platform offers both institutional investors and
    broker-dealers an automated audit trail for each stage in the
    trading cycle. This enables compliance personnel to review
    information relating to trades more easily and with greater
    reliability. Trade information including time, price and
    spread-to-Treasury is stored securely and automatically on our
    electronic trading platform. These data represent a valuable
    source of information for our clients’ compliance
    personnel. Importantly, we believe the automated audit trail,
    together with the competitive pricing that is a feature of our
    electronic trading platform, gives fiduciaries the ability to
    demonstrate that they have achieved best execution on behalf of
    their clients.

Other
    Service Offerings

In addition to services directly related to the execution of
    trades, we offer our clients several other services, including:

Information Services.

The information and
    analytical tools we provide to our clients help them make
    investment and trading decisions. Our Corporate
    BondTicker

TM

provides access to real-time and historical price, yield and
    MarketAxess estimated spread-to-Treasuries for publicly
    disseminated FINRA TRACE-eligible bonds. Corporate
    BondTicker

TM

combines publicly-available TRACE data with the prices for
    trades executed on our U.S. high-grade electronic trading
    platform, integrating the two data sources and providing
    real-time TRACE data with associated analytical tools that are
    not otherwise available. Corporate
    BondTicker

TM

provides end-of-day CDS pricing data combined with CDS analytics
    and screening tools that incorporate cash bond and equity market
    data. In addition, Corporate
    BondTicker

TM

provides indicative prices for secondary loans, through
    arrangements with certain of our broker-dealer clients, and
    independent third-party credit research. Our electronic trading
    platform allows institutional investors to compile, sort and use
    information to discover investment opportunities that might have
    been difficult or impossible to identify using a manual
    information gathering process or other electronic services.

In November 2006, we added a comprehensive set of reports
    designed to review and monitor credit trading activity for
    institutional investor clients. It utilizes extensive TRACE
    information and has a flexible interface to run and save reports
    in a variety of formats for both compliance and management
    reporting. For example, the best execution report provides a
    view of the savings generated by trading on our electronic
    trading platform and offers a quantitative measure of the value
    of price discovery from multiple dealers. The report allows
    clients to monitor performance against their own best execution
    policy. Our compliance product provides a printed history of
    each inquiry submitted through the MarketAxess trading platform.

Straight-Through Processing.

Straight-through
    processing (“STP”) refers to the integration of
    systems and processes to automate the trade process from
    end-to-end — trade execution, confirmation and
    settlement — without the need for manual intervention.
    Our electronic trading platform provides broker-dealers and
    institutional investors with the ability to automate portions of
    their transaction processing requirements, improving accuracy
    and efficiency. Through electronic messaging, institutional
    investors can submit inquiries to, and receive electronic
    notices of execution from us, in industry standard protocols,
    complete with all relevant trade details. Institutional
    investors can download trade messages, allocate trades to
    sub-accounts on whose behalf the trades were made and send the
    allocations to broker-dealers for confirmation.

Robust,
    Scalable Technology Platform

We have developed proprietary technology that is highly secure,
    fault-tolerant and provides adequate capacity for our current
    operations, as well as for substantial growth. Our highly
    scalable systems are designed to accommodate additional volume,
    products and clients with relatively little modification and low
    incremental costs.



Proven
    Innovator with an Experienced Management Team

Since our inception, we have been an innovator in the
    fixed-income securities markets. Our management team is
    comprised of executives with an average of more than
    20 years’ experience in the securities industry. We
    have consistently sought to benefit participants in the markets
    we serve by attempting to replicate the essential features of
    fixed-income trading, including the existing relationships
    between broker-dealers and their institutional investor clients,
    while applying technology to eliminate weaknesses in traditional
    trading methods. In 2007,

Credit

magazine recognized
    MarketAxess as “Best Multi-Dealer Credit Default Swaps
    Trading Platform“and “Best Multi-Dealer Corporate Bond
    Trading Platform” in both the U.S. and Europe. The
    year 2007 was the first year that the award for Best
    Multi-Dealer Credit Default Swaps Trading Platform was included
    in the

Credit

magazine awards, and the third consecutive
    year that MarketAxess has been recognized as the Best
    Multi-Dealer Corporate Bond Trading Platform.

Some of the innovations we have introduced to electronic trading
    include:

•

the first multi-dealer disclosed trading platform for
    U.S. high-grade corporate bonds;

•

the first electronic Treasury benchmarking for
    U.S. high-grade corporate bond trades;

•

Corporate
    BondTicker

TM

,
    our information services product, combining FINRA TRACE bond
    data with MarketAxess data and analytical tools;

•

bid and offer list technology for corporate bond trading,
    enabling institutional investors to request executable prices
    for multiple securities simultaneously;

•

the first disclosed client to multi-dealer trading platform for
    CDS indices; and

•

DealerAxess

®

,
    an innovative dealer-to-dealer electronic trading platform for
    U.S. high-grade corporate bonds, emerging market bonds and
    CDS.

Our
    Strategy

Our objective is to provide the leading global electronic
    trading platform for fixed-income securities, connecting
    broker-dealers and institutional investors more easily and
    efficiently, while offering a broad array of services to market
    participants across the trading cycle. The key elements of our
    strategy are:

Enhance
    the Liquidity of Securities Traded on Our Platform and Broaden
    Our Client Base in Our Existing Markets

We intend to further enhance the liquidity of securities traded
    on our leading electronic, multi-dealer to client fixed-income
    platform. Our ability to innovate and efficiently add new
    functionality and product offerings to the MarketAxess platform
    will help us deepen our market share with our existing clients,
    as well as expand our client base, which we believe will in turn
    lead to even further increases in the liquidity of the
    securities provided by our broker-dealer clients and available
    on our platform. We will seek to make our current product
    offerings on our European electronic trading platform available
    to our 465 active U.S. institutional investor clients
    (firms that executed at least one trade through our electronic
    trading platform between January 2007 and December
    2007) and to increase the number of active European
    institutional investor clients (209 firms that executed at least
    one trade through our electronic trading platform between
    January 2007 and December 2007) using our
    U.S. electronic trading platform, in each case subject to
    regulatory requirements.

Leverage
    our Existing Technology and Client Relationships to Expand into
    New Sectors of the

Fixed-Income

Securities Market

We intend to leverage our technology, as well as our strong
    broker-dealer and institutional investor relationships, to
    deploy our electronic trading platform into additional product
    segments within the fixed-income securities markets and deliver
    fixed-income securities-related technical services and products.
    Due in part to our highly scalable systems, we believe we will
    be able to enter new markets efficiently.



Leverage
    our Existing Technology and Client Relationships to Expand into
    New Client Segments

We intend to leverage our technology and client relationships to
    deploy our electronic trading platform into new client segments.
    For example, we believe that CDS index trading on our platform
    will enable us to increase volumes from our hedge fund clients,
    as this client segment is an active user of CDS. As another
    example, in June 2006 we introduced our
    DealerAxess

®

service, which allows our broker-dealer clients to transact
    U.S. corporate bond, emerging markets bond and CDS trades
    on our platform with other broker-dealer clients.

Continue
    to Strengthen and Expand our Trade-Related Service
    Offerings

We plan to continue building our existing service offerings so
    that our electronic trading platform is more fully integrated
    into the workflow of our broker-dealer and institutional
    investor clients. We also plan to continue to add functionality
    to enhance the ability of our clients to achieve a fully
    automated, end-to-end straight-through processing solution
    (automation from trade initiation to settlement). We are
    continually considering the introduction of new trading
    techniques. As an example, we have the technology necessary to
    offer an anonymous trading protocol that could be exported to
    other markets and sectors of fixed-income securities if and when
    client demand for such a product arises.

Expand
    our Data and Information Services Offerings

We regularly add new content and analytical capabilities to
    Corporate
    BondTicker

TM

in order to improve the value of the information we provide to
    our clients. Examples of added content include pricing for
    credit derivatives and syndicated loans, and independent
    third-party credit research. We intend to continue to widen the
    user base of our data products and to continue adding new
    content and analytical capabilities. In November 2006, we
    introduced compliance reporting tools for our institutional
    investor clients that assist them in monitoring best execution
    requirements for fixed-income trades. As the use of our
    electronic trading platform continues to grow, we believe that
    the amount and value of our proprietary trading data will also
    increase, further enhancing the value of our information
    services offerings to our clients.

Pursue
    Strategic Alliances and Select Acquisitions

We plan to continue to increase and supplement our internal
    growth by entering into strategic alliances, or acquiring
    businesses or technologies, that will enable us to enter new
    markets, provide new products or services, or otherwise enhance
    the value of our platform to our clients. For example, in
    November 2007, we acquired substantially all the assets of TWS,
    a financial software and technology services provider focused on
    providing gateway adapters for connecting order management
    systems and trading systems to fixed-income trading venues.

Current
    Client-to-Dealer Markets

U.S.
    High-Grade Corporate Bonds

Our U.S. high-grade corporate bond business consists of
    U.S. dollar-denominated investment-grade debt issued by
    corporations for distribution in the U.S. Both domestic and
    foreign institutional investors have access to
    U.S. high-grade corporate bond trading on our electronic
    trading platform. We use the terms high-grade debt and
    investment-grade debt interchangeably in this annual report on

Form 10-K.

Our trading volume in the U.S. high-grade corporate bond
    market increased from $10.0 billion in 2001 to
    $200.3 billion in 2007. The majority of trading in
    U.S. high-grade corporate bonds is still conducted by
    telephone.

In the U.S. high-grade corporate bond market, 22
    broker-dealers utilize our platform, including 18 of the top 20
    broker-dealers as ranked by 2007 investment grade new-issue
    underwriting volume. We offer our institutional investor clients
    access to a broad inventory of U.S. high-grade corporate
    bonds, which is provided and updated daily by our broker-dealer
    clients. Our electronic trading platform is a multi-dealer
    disclosed counterparty model, which allows institutional
    investors to view bids and offers from one or more of our
    broker-dealer clients while permitting each party to know the
    identity of its counter-party throughout the trading process. By
    disclosing the counterparties, the inquiry system on which our
    trading platform is based combines the strength of existing
    offline client/dealer



relationships with the efficiency and transparency of an
    electronic trading platform. This enables institutional
    investors to instantly direct trade inquiries and negotiations
    to their traditional broker-dealer or to any of the overwhelming
    majority of the world’s leading broker-dealers who provide
    liquidity in these securities. Institutional investors have
    access to the commingled inventory of our broker-dealer clients,
    representing indicative bids and offers. Each line item of
    inventory represents an indicative bid

and/or

offer
    on a particular bond issue by a particular broker-dealer client.
    Institutional investor clients are not restricted to trading
    only the bonds posted as inventory, although many of the trades
    conducted on our platform are made from the posted inventory. To
    transact in a specific bond that does not appear in inventory,
    institutional investors can easily search our database and
    submit an online inquiry to their chosen broker-dealers, who can
    respond with live, executable prices. While, on average,
    institutional investor clients receive several bids or offers
    from broker-dealers in response to trade inquiries, some
    inquiries may not receive any bids or offers.

European
    High-Grade Corporate Bonds

MarketAxess Europe Limited, our wholly-owned U.K. subsidiary,
    commenced trading operations in August 2001. MarketAxess Europe
    Limited received Financial Services Authority (“FSA”)
    regulatory approval and began to offer European secondary
    trading functionality in U.S. dollar- and Euro-denominated
    European corporate bonds to our broker-dealer and institutional
    investor clients in September 2001. In 2003, we added trading in
    other European high-grade corporate bonds, including bonds
    issued in Pounds Sterling and floating rate notes. As on our
    U.S. electronic trading platform, all trading on our
    European platform is done using a multi-dealer disclosed
    counterparty model. We offered the first platform in Europe with
    this capability for corporate bonds.

In the European high-grade credit market, 19 broker-dealers
    utilize our platform, including 18 of the top 20 broker-dealers
    as ranked by 2007 European investment grade new-issue
    underwriting volume. On a typical day, institutional investors
    on our European corporate bond trading platform have access to
    18,000 line items of commingled inventory, representing an
    aggregate of approximately $90 billion of indicative bids
    and offers. In a single inquiry, institutional investors can
    request bids or offers from up to six of the broker-dealers who
    participate on the European platform. While many of the trades
    conducted on our platform are made from the posted inventory,
    institutional investor clients are not restricted to trading
    only the bonds posted as inventory. To transact in a specific
    bond that does not appear in inventory, institutional investors
    can easily search our database and submit an online inquiry to
    their chosen broker-dealers, who can respond with live,
    executable prices. While, on average, institutional investor
    clients receive several bids or offers from broker-dealers in
    response to trade inquiries, some inquiries may not receive any
    bids or offers. Our 2007 trading volume in the European
    high-grade corporate bond market was $77.4 billion.

Emerging
    Markets Bonds

Twenty of our U.S. broker-dealer clients use our platform
    to trade emerging markets bonds. 253 active institutional
    investor clients (firms that executed at least one trade through
    our electronic trading platform between January 2007 and
    December 2007) utilize our electronic trading platform to
    trade emerging markets bonds. These institutional investor
    clients are located in both the U.S. and Europe. The
    emerging markets countries whose bonds were most frequently
    traded on our platform in 2007 were Brazil, Mexico, Argentina,
    Russia and Venezuela.

In December 2007, we introduced local markets emerging market
    debt trading, which allows our institutional investor clients to
    transact Euroclear-eligible local currency denominated bonds
    issued by sovereign entities or corporations in Argentina,
    Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.

Crossover
    and High-Yield Bonds

Nineteen of our U.S. broker-dealer clients use our platform
    to trade crossover and high-yield bonds. Trading in crossover
    and high-yield bonds uses many of the same features available in
    our U.S. high-grade corporate bond offering.



Agency
    Bonds

Fifteen of our U.S. broker-dealer clients use our platform
    to trade agency bonds. Trading in agency bonds uses many of the
    same features available in our U.S. high-grade corporate
    bond offering.

Credit
    Default Swaps

We launched CDS index trading on our platform in September 2005
    and added the capacity to trade lists of single-name CDS in
    November 2006. In addition to the trading features, the index
    trading platform also offers STP connectivity for dealers and
    institutional investor clients. Four of our
    U.S. broker-dealer clients are live on our platform to
    trade CDS investment grade indices and three for CDS investment
    grade single-name lists.

Current
    Dealer-to-Dealer Markets

U.S.
    High-Grade Corporate Bonds

In the U.S. high-grade corporate bond market, 19
    broker-dealers utilize our
    DealerAxess

®

platform to trade with each other. These dealers include 16 of
    the top 20 broker-dealers as ranked by 2007 investment grade
    new-issue underwriting volume.
    DealerAxess

®

provides live inter-dealer markets utilizing proprietary
    cross-matching technology. Although
    DealerAxess

®

is a completely segregated trading platform, it shares the same
    core technology as our client-to-dealer platform. The platform
    provides a documented record of orders and executed trades with
    reporting that enables broker-dealer clients to track, analyze
    and evaluate their inter-dealer trading. Straight-through
    processing is available to reduce manual tasks and lower the
    number of errors. We estimate that inter-dealer trading
    represents approximately 25% of the reported FINRA TRACE volume
    in U.S. high-grade corporate bonds. The majority of
    inter-dealer trading in U.S. high-grade corporate bonds is
    currently conducted by telephone through voice brokers. Bond
    trades on
    DealerAxess

®

are conducted with MarketAxess as riskless principal. Trades are
    cleared and settled by an independent clearing broker.

Emerging
    Markets Bonds

Thirteen of our broker-dealer clients use our
    DealerAxess

®

platform to trade emerging markets bonds with each other. The
    platform is primarily utilized for transactions in U.S dollar
    denominated bonds issued by Latin American governments. Many of
    the same features available on
    DealerAxess

®

for the trading of U.S high-grade corporate bonds are available
    for emerging markets bonds.

Credit
    Default Swaps

We launched CDS single-name trading for U.S. high-grade and
    index and single-name trading for emerging markets on our
    platform in May 2007. Twelve of our U.S. broker-dealer
    clients are live on our platform to trade U.S. high-grade
    single name CDS and twelve of our U.S. broker-dealer
    clients are live on our platform to trade emerging markets index
    and single-name CDS. CDS transactions are conducted on the
    DealerAxess

®

platform on a name

give-up

basis and are directly settled between the two trading
    counterparties.

Key
    Trading Functionalities

We currently offer both disclosed inquiry trading on our
    client-to-dealer platform and an anonymous cross-matching style
    of trading on our dealer-to-dealer platform. Our
    DealerAxess

®

dealer-to-dealer trading platform provides anonymous live
    markets with executable bids and offers posted by participating
    dealers that are matched using proprietary cross-matching
    technology. The key trading functionalities on our
    client-to-dealer trading platform are detailed below.

Single
    Inquiry Trading Functionality

We currently offer institutional investors the ability to
    request bids or offers in a single inquiry from up to 19 of our
    broker-dealer clients for U.S. high-grade corporate bonds,
    from up to six of our broker-dealer clients for European
    high-grade corporate bonds and from up to eight of our
    broker-dealer clients in emerging markets bonds. Institutional
    investors can obtain bids or offers on any security posted in
    inventory or included in the database available on our platform.



ASAP and
    Holding Bin Trading Functionalities

We provide both ASAP (“as soon as possible”) and
    Holding Bin trading protocols. In the Holding Bin trading
    protocol, institutional investor clients set the time when they
    would like all of the broker-dealers’ prices or spreads
    returned to them, in order to have the ability to see all
    executable prices available at the same time. In the ASAP
    trading protocol, institutional investor clients see each
    broker-dealer’s price or spread as soon as it is entered by
    the broker-dealer.

List
    Trading Functionality

We currently offer institutional investors the ability to
    request bids or offers on a list of bonds, with the number of
    different bonds on each list varying between 8 and 40 items
    depending on the market. This facilitates efficient trading for
    institutional investors such as investment advisors, mutual
    funds and hedge funds. Institutional investors are able to have
    multiple lists executable throughout the trading day, enabling
    them to manage their daily cash flows, portfolio duration, and
    credit and sector exposure.

Swap
    Trading Functionality

We currently offer institutional investors the ability to
    request an offer to purchase one bond and a bid to sell another
    bond, in a manner such that the two trades will be executed
    simultaneously, with payment based on the price or yield
    differential of the securities.

    based upon specific criteria, such as volume, time/date of
    transaction, spread change, issuer or security. This search
    function allows institutional investors to compile information
    relating to potential securities trades in a fraction of the
    time that it takes to manually compile this information from
    disparate sources or other electronic databases, including
    direct TRACE feeds. In addition, Corporate
    BondTicker

TM

provides independent third-party credit research as well as
    indicative prices for secondary markets in loans and CDS.

TRACE facilitates the mandatory reporting of over-the-counter
    secondary market transactions in eligible fixed-income
    securities. All broker-dealers that are FINRA member firms have
    an obligation to report transactions in corporate bonds to TRACE
    under a set of rules approved by the U.S. Securities and
    Exchange Commission (“SEC”). FINRA then publicly
    disseminates a portion of this data, which is available free of
    charge on a delayed basis through the FINRA website or available
    immediately for a set fee.

Corporate
    BondTicker

TM

is integrated directly into the MarketAxess electronic trading
    platform and can be seamlessly accessed, either when viewing
    securities inventory or when launching an inquiry. Corporate
    BondTicker

TM

is also available through the Internet for non-trading
    professional market participants, including, among others,
    research analysts and rating agencies, who can log in and access
    the information via an easy-to-use browser-based interface.

We provide Corporate
    BondTicker

TM

as an ancillary service to our trading clients and also to other
    industry participants. We derive revenues from our Corporate
    BondTicker

TM

service by charging for seat licenses per user at our
    broker-dealer and institutional investor clients, through
    distribution agreements with other information service providers
    and through bulk data sales to third parties. Seat license fees
    from institutional investor clients are waived for clients that
    transact a sufficient volume of trades through MarketAxess.



Additional analytical capabilities of our information services
    offerings aim to provide clients with more information regarding
    bond prices and market activity, including asset swap spreads,
    turnover percentage and liquidity ratios. These statistics
    measure a security’s trading activity relative to its
    amount outstanding and relative to the overall market,
    respectively, providing an additional perspective on relative
    liquidity. In addition, we provide pricing measures to help
    institutional investors better assess the relative value of a
    corporate bond, providing more consistent relative pricing
    information for institutional investors, such as offering spread
    data versus the interest rate swap curve and versus the
    U.S. Treasury curve. Users are also able to download a
    variety of MarketAxess-compiled trade reports containing a
    comprehensive review of trading activity. Corporate
    BondTicker

TM

is currently the source of corporate bond trading information
    for

The Wall Street Journal.

In November 2006, we added a comprehensive set of reports
    designed to review and monitor credit trading activity for
    institutional investor clients. It utilizes extensive TRACE
    information and has a flexible interface to run and save reports
    in a variety of formats for both compliance and management
    reporting. For example, the best execution report provides a
    view of the savings generated by trading on our electronic
    trading platform and offers a quantitative measure of the value
    of price discovery from multiple dealers. The report allows
    clients to monitor performance against their own best execution
    policy. Our compliance product provides a printed history of
    each inquiry submitted through the MarketAxess trading platform.

In November 2007, we added end-of-day CDS pricing data to
    Corporate
    BondTicker

TM

that is provided by Credit Market Analysis Ltd. End-of-day
    screening tools combine the CDS data with market data from cash
    bonds and equities to provide relative value analysis to our
    clients.

My
    Portfolio

Institutional investors are able to upload their corporate bond
    portfolio to our electronic trading platform utilizing the
    “My Portfolio” trading feature. Institutional
    investors who utilize “My Portfolio” benefit from the
    ability to automatically match inventory on our platform to
    bonds held in their portfolio, allowing them to more efficiently
    launch an inquiry and transact in these securities. Users of
    this feature can also directly access Corporate
    BondTicker

TM

to obtain the trading history of the securities in their
    portfolio.

Straight-Through
    Processing

Straight-through processing refers to the integration of systems
    and processes to automate the trade process from
    end-to-end — trade execution, confirmation and
    settlement — without the need for manual intervention.
    There are two elements of straight-through processing: internal
    straight-through processing and external straight-through
    processing. Internal straight-through processing relates to the
    trade and settlement processes that are internal to an industry
    participant. For example, in the case of an institutional
    investor, this includes authorization of orders, placement of
    orders with broker-dealers, receipt of execution details and
    allocation of trades. External straight-through processing
    refers to connecting seamlessly to all external counterparts in
    the trading and settlement process.

Automation by way of straight-through processing improves
    efficiency throughout the trade cycle. We provide broker-dealers
    and institutional investors with a range of tools that
    facilitate straight-through processing, including order upload,
    easy-to-use online allocation tools and pre- and post-trade
    messaging features that enable institutional investors to
    communicate electronically between front- and back-office
    systems, thereby integrating the order, portfolio management and
    accounting systems of our broker-dealer and institutional
    investor clients in real time. Our straight-through processing
    tools can be customized to meet specific needs of clients. We
    continue to build industry partnerships to assist our clients in
    creating connectivity throughout the trade cycle. Through these
    partnerships, we are increasingly providing solutions that can
    quickly be deployed within our clients’ trading operations.

Usage of our straight-through processing tools increased
    significantly during 2007. In our U.S. high-grade corporate
    bond business between 2005 and 2007, the number of orders
    uploaded electronically increased from 5,459 to 72,517. The
    number of online allocations increased from 58,847 to 94,187 and
    the number of completed trades delivered to institutional
    investor clients through our post-trade messaging functionality
    increased from 18% to 56% of total volume between 2005 and 2007.



Dealer
    API

We offer Application Programming Interface (“API”)
    services to our broker-dealer clients for pre-trade, trade
    negotiation and post-trade services. This allows for
    straight-through processing, which improves efficiency and
    reduces errors in processing.

Technology
    Services

In 2007, we began providing technology consulting services. Fees
    for such services are charged based upon the complexity and
    extent of the services provided.

In November 2007, we formed a new subsidiary company,
    MarketAxess Technologies Inc., which acquired substantially all
    the assets of TWS, a financial software and technology services
    provider focused on providing gateway adapters for connecting
    order management systems and trading systems to fixed-income
    trading venues.

Dependence
    on Our Broker-Dealer Clients Who Are Also Our
    Stockholders

Revenues

We have historically earned a substantial portion of our
    commissions and overall revenues from broker-dealer clients that
    are (or whose affiliates are) also our stockholders
    (“Stockholder Broker-Dealer Clients”). For 2007, a
    total of seven dealers, and for 2006 and 2005, a total of nine
    dealers, were considered to be Stockholder

Broker-Dealer

Clients. Affiliates of most of our broker-dealer clients are
    also among our institutional investor clients. Information
    relating to the percentage of our commissions and total revenues
    generated by the Stockholder Broker-Dealer Clients is provided
    in the chart below:

Number of Stockholder Broker-Dealer Clients




As of January 1, 2007, we believe these seven broker-dealer
    clients owned 12,979,397 shares or 37.4% of our common
    stock on a diluted basis, assuming conversion of our non-voting
    common stock and exercise of warrants into common stock. To the
    extent that some or all of these broker-dealer clients or their
    affiliates vote similarly, they are likely to be able to
    influence decisions requiring approval by our stockholders.

Our broker-dealer clients are not restricted from buying and
    selling fixed-income securities, directly or through their own
    proprietary or third-party platforms, with institutional
    investors. For more information, see “Item 1A.,

Risk Factors

— Risks Related to the Potential
    Conflicts of Interest With Our Broker-Dealer Clients Who Are
    Also Our Stockholders — We are dependent on our
    broker-dealer clients, seven of which were also our stockholders
    as of January 1, 2007, who are not restricted from buying
    and selling fixed-income securities, directly or through their
    own proprietary or third-party platforms, with institutional
    investors.”

Board
    of Directors

We currently have 11 directors, nine of whom are not our
    employees. Of the nine non-employee directors, two are employees
    of entities that are affiliates of broker-dealer clients and
    stockholders of MarketAxess, although these entities do not have
    the contractual right to designate members of our Board of
    Directors.

Other
    Businesses

Our broker-dealer clients currently trade fixed-income
    securities by means other than our electronic trading platform
    and we expect them to continue to do so in the future. Our
    broker-dealer clients buy and sell fixed-income securities
    directly with their clients through traditional bond trading
    methods, including the telephone,

e-mail

messaging and other electronic means of communication, including
    proprietary, single-dealer systems.



We cannot be assured that such broker-dealers’ primary
    commitments will not be to one of our competitors. Other
    companies, including some in which certain of our broker-dealer
    clients or their affiliates have invested, have developed
    electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention
    to explore the development of electronic trading platforms that
    compete or will compete with us. Furthermore, our broker-dealer
    clients or their affiliates have made, or may in the future make
    investments in or enter into agreements with other businesses
    that directly or indirectly compete with us.

Conflicts
    of Interest

For information concerning the potential conflicts of interest
    that may arise as a result of the various roles (broker-dealer
    client and stockholder) played by certain of our broker-dealer
    clients, please see “Item 1A.,

Risk
    Factors

— Risks Related to the Potential Conflicts
    of Interest With Our Broker-Dealer Clients Who Are Also Our
    Stockholders.”

Sales and
    Marketing

We promote our products and services using a variety of direct
    and indirect sales and marketing strategies. Our sales force is
    responsible for client acquisition activity and for increasing
    use of our platform by our existing clients. Their goal is to
    train and support existing and new clients on how to use the
    system and to educate them as to the benefits of utilizing an
    electronic fixed-income trading platform. We employ various
    strategies, including advertising, direct marketing, promotional
    mailings and participation in industry conferences, to increase
    awareness of our brand and our electronic trading platform. For
    example, we have worked with

The Wall Street Journal

to
    establish Corporate
    BondTicker

TM

as the source of information for its daily corporate bond and
    high-yield tables.

Competition

The electronic trading industry is highly competitive and we
    expect competition to intensify in the future. We face four main
    areas of competition:

•

Telephone

— We compete with bond trading
    business conducted over the telephone between broker-dealers and
    their institutional investor clients. Institutional investors
    have historically purchased fixed-income securities by
    telephoning bond sales professionals at one or more
    broker-dealers and inquiring about the price and availability of
    individual bonds. This remains the manner in which the majority
    of corporate bonds are still traded between institutional
    investors and broker-dealers.

•

E-mail

—
    We compete with bond trading business conducted via

e-mail

between broker-dealers and their institutional investor clients.

E-mail

provides an efficient means of initiating product and price
    discovery with a large universe of potential trading partners.

•

Other electronic trading platforms

— There are
    numerous other electronic trading platforms currently in
    existence. These include: Thomson TradeWeb, a multi-dealer to
    institutional investor trading platform that has historically
    focused on government bond trading; Bloomberg, which provides
    electronic trading functionality; and the New York Stock
    Exchange, which launched a retail corporate bond trading
    platform in April 2007. In 2002, Thomson TradeWeb launched an
    electronic corporate bond trading platform. In addition, some
    broker-dealers operate proprietary electronic trading systems
    that enable institutional investors to trade directly with a
    broker-dealer over an electronic medium. We believe that we are
    currently the only platform primarily focused on multi-party
    disclosed trading of credit products between broker-dealers and
    institutional investors, though others have or may seek to
    expand their product offerings to compete in this market.
    Additionally, as we expand our business into new products, we
    will likely come into more direct competition with other
    electronic trading platforms or firms offering traditional
    services. For instance, our
    DealerAxess

®

platform competes with services offered by inter-dealer
    brokerage firms including BGC Partners L.P., Creditex, GFI Group
    Inc., ICAP plc and Tullet Prebon plc.

•

Market data and information vendors

— Several
    large market data and information providers currently have a
    data and analytics relationship with virtually every
    institutional firm. Some of these entities currently offer
    varying forms of electronic trading of fixed-income securities,
    mostly on a single-dealer basis. Some of these



entities have announced their intention to expand their
    electronic trading platforms or to develop new platforms. These
    entities are currently direct competitors to our information
    services business and may in the future become direct
    competitors to our electronic trading platform.

Competitors, including companies in which some of our
    broker-dealer clients have invested, have developed electronic
    trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore
    the development of electronic trading platforms that compete or
    will compete with us. Furthermore, our broker-dealer clients
    have made, or may in the future make investments in or enter
    into agreements with other businesses that directly or
    indirectly compete with us.

In general, we compete on the basis of a number of key factors,
    including:

•

broad network of broker-dealer and institutional investor
    clients using our electronic trading platform;

•

liquidity provided by the participating broker-dealers;

•

magnitude and frequency of price improvement;

•

facilitating the quality and speed of execution;

•

compliance benefits;

•

total transaction costs;

•

technology capabilities, including the reliability and ease of
    use of our electronic trading platform; and

•

range of products and services offered.

We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these
    factors. Our trading volume has grown over the past five years
    and we continue to proactively build technology solutions that
    serve the needs of the credit markets.

Our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and
    integration of our broker-dealer and institutional investor
    clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems.
    We have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we
    serve in the development of our platform, working closely with
    our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs.

Our broker-dealer clients have invested in building API’s
    with us for inventory contributions, electronic trading,
    government bond benchmark pricing and post-trade messaging. We
    believe that we have successfully built deep roots with our
    broker-dealer clients, increasing our level of service to them
    while at the same time increasing their commitment to our
    services.

Furthermore, approximately 150 of our institutional investor
    clients have built interfaces to enable them to communicate
    electronically between our platform and their order, portfolio
    management and accounting systems. We believe that this
    increases the reliance of these institutional investor clients
    on our services and creates significant competitive barriers to
    entry.

Technology

The design and quality of our technology are critical to our
    growth and our ability to execute our business strategy. Our
    electronic trading platform has been designed with secure,
    scalable client-server architecture that makes broad use of
    distributed computing to achieve speed, reliability and fault
    tolerance. The platform is built on industry-standard
    technologies and has been designed to handle many multiples of
    our current trading volume.

All critical server-side components, primarily our networks,
    application servers and databases, have backup equipment running
    in case the main equipment fails. This offers fully redundant
    system capacity to maximize uptime and minimize the potential
    for loss of transaction data in the event of an internal
    failure. We also seek to minimize the impact of external
    failures by automatically recovering connections in the event of
    a communications failure. The majority of our broker-dealer
    clients have dedicated high-speed T-1 communication lines to our
    network in order to provide fast data transfer. Our security
    measures include industry-standard communications encryption.



We have designed our application with an easy-to-use,
    Windows-based interface. Through a secure, single sign-on, our
    clients are able to access our electronic trading platform.
    Clients are also able to execute transactions over our platform
    directly from their order management systems. We provide users
    an automatic software update feature that does not require
    manual intervention.

Intellectual
    Property

We rely upon a combination of copyright, patent, trade secret
    and trademark laws, written agreements and common law to protect
    our proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual
    property. Our software code, elements of our electronic trading
    platform, Web site and other proprietary materials are protected
    by copyright laws. We currently have six patent applications
    pending, covering certain aspects of our business.

The written agreements upon which we rely to protect our
    proprietary technology, processes and intellectual property
    include agreements designed to protect our trade secrets.
    Examples of these written agreements include third party
    nondisclosure agreements, employee nondisclosure and inventions
    assignment agreements, and agreements with customers,
    contractors and strategic partners. Other written agreements
    upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology,
    processes and intellectual property take many forms and contain
    provisions related to patent, copyright, trademark or trade
    secret rights.

We have obtained U.S. federal registration of the
    MarketAxess

®

name and logo, and the same mark and logo have been registered
    in several foreign jurisdictions. We have pending registrations
    for the
    MarketAxess

®

name and logo in several other foreign jurisdictions. In
    addition, we have obtained U.S. federal registration for
    the marks

    BondTicker

is a trademark we use, but it has not been registered.

In addition to our efforts to register our intellectual
    property, we believe that factors such as the technological and
    creative skills of our personnel, new product and service
    developments, frequent enhancements and reliability with respect
    to our services are essential to establishing and maintaining a
    technology and market leadership position.

Government
    Regulation

The securities industry and financial markets in the
    U.S. and elsewhere are subject to extensive regulation. As
    a matter of public policy, regulatory bodies in the
    U.S. and the rest of the world are charged with
    safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial
    markets and with protecting the interests of investors
    participating in those markets. Our active broker-dealer
    subsidiaries fall within the scope of their regulations.

Regulation
    of the U.S. Securities Industry and Broker-Dealers

In the U.S., the SEC is the governmental agency responsible for
    the administration of the federal securities laws. Our
    U.S. subsidiary, MarketAxess Corporation, is registered
    with the SEC as a broker-dealer. It is also a member of FINRA, a
    self-regulatory organization to which most broker-dealers
    belong. In addition, MarketAxess Corporation is a member of the
    Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which provides
    certain protection for clients’ accounts in the event of a
    liquidation of a broker-dealer to the extent any such accounts
    are held by the broker-dealer.

Additionally, MarketAxess Corporation is registered with certain
    states and the District of Columbia as a broker-dealer. The
    states and the District of Columbia are responsible for the
    administration of their respective “blue sky” laws,
    rules and regulations.

Regulation
    of the

Non-U.S.

Securities Industries and Investment Service
    Providers

The securities industry and financial markets in the U.K., the
    European Union and elsewhere are subject to extensive
    regulation. MarketAxess Europe Limited may fall within the scope
    of those regulations depending upon the extent to which it is
    characterized as providing a regulated investment service.



Our principal regulator in the U.K. is the FSA. Our subsidiary,
    MarketAxess Europe Limited, is registered as a Multilateral
    Trading Facility (“MTF”) with the FSA.

The securities industry in the member states of the European
    Union is regulated by agencies in each member state. European
    Union measures provide for the mutual recognition of regulatory
    agencies and of prudential supervision making possible the grant
    of a single authorization for providers of investment services,
    which, in general, is valid throughout the European Union. As an
    FSA-approved MTF, MarketAxess Europe Limited receives the
    benefit of this authorization.

In May 2003, we incorporated a Canadian subsidiary, MarketAxess
    Canada Limited. It has applied for registration as an
    Alternative Trading System under the Securities Act of Ontario
    and is in the process of seeking approval for membership with
    the Investment Dealers Association of Canada.

Employees

As of December 31, 2007, we had 182 employees, 149 of
    whom were based in the U.S. and 33 of whom were based in
    the U.K. None of our employees is represented by a labor union.
    We consider our relationships with our employees to be good and
    have not experienced any interruptions of operations due to
    labor disagreements.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Risks
    Related to the Potential Conflicts of Interest With Our
    Broker-Dealer Clients

Who Are Also Our Stockholders

We are
    dependent on our broker-dealer clients, seven of which were also
    our stockholders as of January 1, 2007, who are not
    restricted from buying and selling fixed-income securities,
    directly or through their own proprietary or third-party
    platforms, with institutional investors.

We rely on our broker-dealer clients to provide product and
    liquidity on our electronic trading platform by posting bond
    prices on our platform for bonds in their inventory and
    responding to institutional investor client inquiries. Although
    each broker-dealer client is currently a party to an agreement
    with us, the obligations of each broker-dealer under these
    agreements are minimal. None of these agreements is exclusive
    and broker-dealers may terminate such agreements

and/or

enter
    into, and in some cases have entered into, similar agreements
    with our competitors. For example, some of our broker-dealer
    clients are also clients of Thomson TradeWeb, a multi-dealer to
    institutional investor trading platform that operates an online
    corporate bond trading platform.

Our broker-dealer clients buy and sell fixed-income securities
    directly with their clients through traditional bond trading
    methods, including telephone conversations,

e-mail

messaging and other electronic means of communication.
    Currently, the preponderance of trading of U.S. high-grade
    corporate bonds still occurs using traditional bond trading
    methods. Most of our broker-dealer and institutional investor
    clients are involved in other ventures, including other
    electronic trading platforms or other distribution channels, as
    trading participants

and/or

as
    equity holders, and such ventures or newly created ventures may
    compete with us and our electronic trading platform now and in
    the future.

Some of our broker-dealer clients have developed electronic
    trading networks or have announced their intention to explore
    the development of electronic trading networks. These competing
    trading platforms may offer some features that we do not
    currently offer. Furthermore, our broker-dealer clients have
    made, and may in the future continue to make, investments in
    businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us,
    including, either individually or collectively, organizing or
    investing in a separate company similar to us for the purpose of
    competing with us or pursuing corporate opportunities that might
    be attractive to us. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that
    such broker-dealers’ primary commitments will not be to one
    of our competitors.

Any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by
    our broker-dealer clients would reduce the number of different
    bond issues and the volume of trading in those bond issues on
    our platform, which could, in turn, reduce the use of our
    platform by our institutional investor clients. The occurrence
    of any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on
    our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We
    derive a significant percentage of our total revenues, and an
    even greater percentage of our commissions, from broker-dealer
    clients who are also our stockholders.

We have historically earned a substantial portion of our
    commissions from broker-dealer clients that were our
    stockholders. For the year ended December 31, 2007,
    $31.4 million or 39.2% of our commissions, for the year
    ended December 31, 2006, $35.6 million or 49.9% of our
    commissions and for the year ended December 31, 2005,
    $36.6 million or 54.7% of our commissions were generated by
    these stockholder broker-dealer clients. None of our
    broker-dealer clients is contractually or otherwise obligated to
    continue to use our electronic trading platform. Reduced
    involvement of these broker-dealer clients due to the reduction
    in the level of their equity ownership may cause them to reduce
    or discontinue their use of our electronic trading platform and
    other services, which could negatively impact the use of our
    platform by our institutional investor clients. The loss of, or
    a significant reduction of, participation on our platform by
    these broker-dealer clients may have a material adverse effect
    on our business, financial condition and results of operations.



Several
    of our broker-dealer clients or their affiliates beneficially
    own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock.
    These broker-dealer clients have strategic interests that differ
    from those of our other stockholders.

As of January 1, 2007, seven of our broker-dealer clients
    or their affiliates owned, in the aggregate, a significant
    percentage of our outstanding common stock. These broker-dealer
    clients have strategic interests that may be different from ours
    and those of our other stockholders. For example, in their
    capacity as broker-dealer clients, they would presumably favor
    lower commissions

and/or

commission caps. Furthermore, as stockholders in other consortia
    that have developed competitive electronic trading networks or
    have announced their intention to explore the development of
    competitive electronic trading networks, they may decide to
    direct some or all of their electronic trading business to one
    or more of our competitors. While these actions, if taken, would
    presumably reduce our revenues and our market capitalization
    and, therefore, the value of their ownership position in us,
    there can be no assurance that they will not decide to take such
    actions for their own strategic reasons.

We are not a party to any voting agreement with any of our
    stockholders and are not aware of any voting agreements among
    our broker-dealer clients; however, they may enter into a voting
    agreement in the future or otherwise vote in a similar manner.
    To the extent that all of these broker-dealer clients or their
    affiliates vote similarly, they will be able to determine
    decisions requiring approval by our stockholders. As a result,
    they or their affiliates may be able to:

•

control the composition of our Board of Directors through their
    ability to nominate directors and vote their shares to elect
    them;

•

control our management and policies; and

•

determine the outcome of significant corporate transactions,
    including changes in control that may be beneficial to other
    stockholders.

As a result of these factors, we may be less likely to pursue
    relationships with strategic partners who are not stockholders
    of ours, which could impede our ability to expand our business
    and strengthen our competitive position. Furthermore, these
    factors could also limit stockholder value by preventing a
    change in control or sale of MarketAxess.

We may
    be limited in our use of our U.S. net operating loss
    carryforwards.

As of December 31, 2007, we had U.S. net operating
    loss carryforwards of $100.8 million that will begin to
    expire in 2019. A net operating loss carryforward enables a
    company to apply net operating losses incurred during a current
    period against future periods’ profits in order to reduce
    tax liability in those future periods.

Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that when
    a company undergoes an “ownership change”, that
    company’s use of its net operating losses is limited
    annually in each subsequent year. An “ownership
    change” occurs when, as of any testing date, the sum of the
    increases in ownership of each shareholder that owns five
    percent or more of the value of a company’s stock as
    compared to that shareholder’s lowest percentage ownership
    during the preceding three-year period exceeds
    50 percentage points. For purposes of this rule, certain
    shareholders who own less than five percent of a company’s
    stock are aggregated and treated as a single five-percent
    shareholder.

In 2000 and 2001, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. and MarketAxess
    Corporation had an “ownership change.” Net operating
    loss carryforwards of $39.2 million existed as of the date
    of ownership change. However, only $6.8 million are deemed
    utilizable and recognized in the net operating loss carryforward
    figure. In 2007, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. experienced an
    ownership change. We do not believe that this ownership change
    significantly impacts our ability to utilize existing net
    operating loss carryforwards.

The issuance or repurchase of a significant number of shares of
    stock or purchases or sales of stock by significant shareholders
    could result in an additional “ownership change.” For,
    example, we may issue a substantial number of shares of our
    stock in connection with offerings, acquisitions and other
    transactions in the future and we could repurchase a significant
    number of shares in connection with a stock repurchase program,
    although no assurance can be given that any such offering,
    acquisition, other transaction or repurchase program will be
    undertaken. In addition, the exercise of outstanding options to
    purchase shares of our common stock may require us to issue
    additional shares of our common stock. The extent of the actual
    future use of our U.S. net operating loss



carryforwards is subject to inherent uncertainty because it
    depends on the amount of otherwise taxable income we may earn.
    We cannot give any assurance that we will have sufficient
    taxable income in future years to use any of our federal net
    operating loss carryforwards before they would otherwise expire.

Risks
    Related to Our Business

We
    face substantial competition that could reduce our market share
    and harm our financial performance.

The fixed-income securities industry generally, and the
    electronic financial services markets in which we operate in
    particular, are highly competitive, and we expect competition to
    intensify in the future. We will continue to compete with bond
    trading conducted directly between broker-dealers and their
    institutional investor clients over the telephone or
    electronically. In addition, our current and prospective
    competitors are numerous and include:

•

other multi-dealer trading companies;

•

market data and information vendors;

•

securities and futures exchanges;

•

inter-dealer brokerage firms;

•

electronic communications networks;

•

technology, software, information and media or other companies
    that have existing commercial relationships with broker-dealers
    or institutional investors; and

•

other electronic marketplaces that are not currently in the
    securities business.

Many of our current and potential competitors are more
    established and substantially larger than we are and have
    substantially greater market presence, as well as greater
    financial, engineering, technical, marketing and other
    resources. These competitors may aggressively reduce their
    pricing to enter into market segments in which we have a
    leadership position today, potentially subsidizing any losses
    with profits from trading in other fixed-income or equity
    securities. In addition, many of our competitors offer a wider
    range of services, have broader name recognition and have larger
    customer bases than we do. Some of them may be able to respond
    more quickly to new or evolving opportunities, technologies and
    customer requirements than we can and may be able to undertake
    more extensive promotional activities.

Any combination of our competitors may enter into joint ventures
    or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by
    us. Current and new competitors can launch new platforms at a
    relatively low cost. Others may acquire the capabilities
    necessary to compete with us through acquisitions. We expect
    that we will potentially compete with a variety of companies
    with respect to each product or service we offer. If we are not
    able to compete successfully in the future, our business,
    financial condition and results of operations would be adversely
    affected.

Neither
    the sustainability of our current level of business nor our
    historical growth can be assured. Even if we do experience
    growth, we cannot assure you that we will grow
    profitably.

The use of our electronic trading platform is relatively new.
    The success of our business strategy depends, in part, on our
    ability to maintain and expand the network of broker-dealer and
    institutional investor clients that use our electronic trading
    platform. Our business strategy also depends on increasing the
    use of our platform by these clients. Individuals at
    broker-dealers or institutional investors may have conflicting
    interests, which may discourage their use of our platform.

Our growth is also dependent on our ability to diversify our
    revenue base. We currently derive a majority of our revenues
    from secondary trading in U.S. high-grade corporate bonds.
    The percentage of our commissions from such trading remained
    relatively constant for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005. Our long-term business strategy is dependent on
    expanding our service offerings and increasing our revenues from
    other fixed-income products and other sources. We cannot assure
    you that our efforts will be successful or result in increased
    revenues or continued profitability.



Our plans to pursue other opportunities for revenue growth are
    at an early stage, and we cannot assure you that our plans will
    be successful or that we will actually proceed with them as
    described.

Because
    we operate in a rapidly evolving industry, it is difficult to
    evaluate our business and prospects.

We expect to encounter risks and difficulties frequently
    experienced by companies operating in rapidly evolving
    industries, such as the electronic financial services industry.
    These risks and difficulties include, but are not limited to,
    our ability to:

•

attract and retain broker-dealers and institutional investors on
    a cost-effective basis;

•

expand and enhance reliable and cost-effective product and
    service offerings to our clients;

•

respond effectively to competitive pressures;

•

diversify our sources of revenues;

•

maintain adequate control of our expenses;

•

operate, support, expand and develop our operations, website,
    software, communications and other systems;

•

manage growth in personnel and operations;

•

increase awareness of our brand or market positioning;

•

expand our sales and marketing programs; and

•

respond to regulatory changes or demands.

If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks or in executing
    our business strategy, our business, financial condition and
    results of operations may suffer.

Decreases
    in trading volumes in the fixed-income markets generally or on
    our platform could harm our business and
    profitability.

We have experienced decreases in overall trading volume in
    certain periods, and may experience decreases in trading volume
    in the future. Declines in the overall volume of fixed-income
    securities trading and in market liquidity generally, as well as
    declines in interest rate volatility, result in lower revenues
    from commissions for trades executed on our electronic trading
    platform and fees generated from related activities.

Likewise, decreases in our share of the segments of the
    fixed-income trading markets in which we operate, or shifts in
    trading volume to segments of clients which we have not
    penetrated, could result in lower trading volume on our platform
    and, consequently, lower commissions and other revenue. During
    periods of increased volatility in credit markets, the use of
    electronic trading platforms by market participants may decrease
    dramatically as institutional investors may seek to obtain
    additional information during the trade process through
    conversations with broker-dealers. In addition, during rapidly
    moving markets, broker-dealers may be less likely to post prices
    electronically.

A decline in trading volumes on our platform for any reason may
    have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

We may
    enter into new fee plans, the impact of which may be difficult
    to evaluate.

On June 1, 2005, we introduced a new fee plan primarily for
    secondary market transactions in U.S. high-grade corporate
    bonds executed on our electronic trading platform. On
    June 1, 2007, we introduced a new fee plan for European
    high-grade corporate bonds for the majority of our European
    dealers. The European dealers signed new one-year agreements. In
    addition, we anticipate that from time to time we will introduce
    new fee plans for the other market segments in which we operate.
    Any new fee plan may include different fee structures or provide
    volume incentives.



We cannot assure you that any new fee plans will result in an
    increase in the volume of transactions effected on our platform
    or that our revenues will increase as a result of the
    implementation of any such fee plans. Furthermore, resistance to
    the new fee plans by our broker-dealer or institutional investor
    clients could have a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

We are
    exposed to risks resulting from non-performance by
    counterparties to transactions executed between our
    broker-dealer clients in which we act as an intermediary in
    matching back-to back bond trades.

In June 2006, we began executing riskless principal bond
    transactions between our broker-dealer clients through our
    subsidiary, MarketAxess Corporation. We act as an intermediary
    in these transactions by serving as counterparty to both the
    buyer and the seller in matching back-to-back trades, which are
    then settled through a third-party clearing organization.
    Settlement typically occurs within one to three trading days
    after the trade date. Cash settlement of the transaction occurs
    upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was
    traded.

We are exposed to credit risk in our role as trading
    counterparty to our broker-dealer clients executing bond trades
    on the
    DealerAxess

®

platform. We are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe
    us money, securities or other assets will not perform their
    obligations. These parties may default on their obligations to
    us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or
    other reasons. Adverse movements in the prices of securities
    that are the subject of these transactions can increase our
    risk. Where the unmatched position or failure to deliver is
    prolonged there may also be regulatory capital charges required
    to be taken by us. The policies and procedures we use to manage
    this credit risk are new and untested. There can be no assurance
    that these policies and procedures will effectively mitigate our
    exposure to credit risk.

If we
    experience significant fluctuations in our operating results or
    fail to meet revenues and earnings expectations, our stock price
    may fall rapidly and without advance notice.

Due to our limited operating history, our evolving business
    model and the unpredictability of our industry, we may
    experience significant fluctuations in our operating results. We
    base our current and future expense levels and our investment
    plans on estimates of future revenues and future rate of growth.
    Our expenses and investments are, to a large extent, fixed and
    we expect that these expenses will increase in the future. We
    may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our
    revenues fall short of our expectations.

Our revenues and operating results may also fluctuate due to
    other factors, including:

•

our ability to retain existing broker-dealer and institutional
    investor clients and attract new broker-dealer and institutional
    investor clients;

•

our ability to drive an increase in use of our electronic
    trading platform by new and existing broker-dealer and
    institutional investor clients;

•

changes in our pricing policies;

•

the introduction of new features on our electronic trading
    platform;

•

the effectiveness of our sales force;

•

new product and service introductions by our competitors;

•

fluctuations in overall market trading volume;

•

technical difficulties or interruptions in our service;

•

general economic conditions in our geographic markets;

•

additional investment in our services or operations; and

•

regulatory compliance costs.

As a result, our operating results may fluctuate significantly
    on a quarterly basis, which could result in decreases in our
    stock price.



We may
    not be able to introduce enhanced versions of our electronic
    trading platform, new services and/or service enhancements in a
    timely or acceptable manner, which could harm our competitive
    position.

Our business environment is characterized by rapid technological
    change, changing and increasingly sophisticated client demands
    and evolving industry standards. Our future will depend on our
    ability to develop and introduce new features to, and new
    versions of, our electronic trading platform. The success of new
    features and versions depends on several factors, including the
    timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the
    feature or version. In addition, the market for our electronic
    trading platform may be limited if prospective clients require
    customized features or functions that we are unable or unwilling
    to provide. If we are unable to anticipate and respond to the
    demand for new services, products and technologies and develop
    new features and enhanced versions of our electronic trading
    platform that achieve widespread levels of market acceptance on
    a timely and cost-effective basis, it could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

As we
    enter new markets, we may not be able to successfully attract
    clients and adapt our technology and marketing strategy for use
    in those markets.

Our strategy includes leveraging our electronic trading platform
    to enter new markets. We cannot assure you that we will be able
    to successfully adapt our proprietary software and technology
    for use in other markets. Even if we do adapt our software and
    technology, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract
    clients and compete successfully in any such new markets. We
    cannot assure you that our marketing efforts or our pursuit of
    any of these opportunities will be successful. If these efforts
    are not successful, we may realize less than expected earnings,
    which in turn could result in a decrease in the market value of
    our common stock. Furthermore, these efforts may divert
    management attention or inefficiently utilize our resources.

Rapid
    technological changes may render our technology obsolete or
    decrease the attractiveness of our products and services to our
    broker-dealer and institutional investor clients.

We must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading
    platform. The electronic financial services industry is
    characterized by increasingly complex systems and
    infrastructures and new business models. If new industry
    standards and practices emerge, our existing technology, systems
    and electronic trading platform may become obsolete or our
    existing business may be harmed. Our future success will depend
    on our ability to:

•

enhance our existing products and services;

•

develop

and/or

license new products and technologies that address the
    increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our broker-dealer
    and institutional investor clients and prospective
    clients; and

•

respond to technological advances and emerging industry
    standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis.

Developing our electronic trading platform and other technology
    entails significant technical and business risks. We may use new
    technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our
    electronic trading platform, information databases and network
    infrastructure to broker-dealer or institutional investor client
    requirements or emerging industry standards. For example, our
    electronic trading platform functionality that allows searches
    and inquiries on bond pricing and availability is a critical
    part of our service, and it may become out-of-date or
    insufficient from our broker-dealer clients’ or
    institutional investor clients’ perspective and in relation
    to the inquiry functionality of our competitors’ systems.
    If we face material delays in introducing new services, products
    and enhancements, our broker-dealer and institutional investor
    clients may forego the use of our products and use those of our
    competitors.

Further, the adoption of new Internet, networking or
    telecommunications technologies may require us to devote
    substantial resources to modify and adapt our services. We
    cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement
    new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology and
    transaction-processing systems to client requirements or
    emerging industry standards. We cannot assure you that we will
    be able to respond in a timely manner to changing market
    conditions or client requirements.



We
    depend on third-party suppliers for key products and
    services.

We rely on a number of third parties to supply elements of our
    trading, information and other systems, as well as computers and
    other equipment, and related support and maintenance. We cannot
    assure you that any of these providers will be able to continue
    to provide these services in an efficient, cost-effective
    manner, if at all, or that they will be able to adequately
    expand their services to meet our needs. If we are unable to
    make alternative arrangements for the supply of critical
    products or services in the event of a malfunction of a product
    or an interruption in or the cessation of service by an existing
    service provider, our business, financial condition and results
    of operations could be materially adversely affected.

In particular, we depend on a third-party vendor for our
    corporate bond reference database. Disruptions in the services
    provided by that third party to us, including as a result of
    their inability or unwillingness to continue to license products
    that are critical to the success of our business, could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

We also rely, and expect in the future to continue to rely, on
    third parties for various computer and communications systems,
    such as telephone companies, online service providers, data
    processors, and software and hardware vendors. Other third
    parties provide, for instance, our data center,
    telecommunications access lines and significant computer systems
    and software licensing, support and maintenance services. Any
    interruption in these or other third-party services or
    deterioration in their performance could impair the quality of
    our service. We cannot be certain of the financial viability of
    all of the third parties on which we rely.

We license software from third parties, much of which is
    integral to our electronic trading platform and our business. We
    also hire contractors to assist in the development, quality
    assurance testing and maintenance of our electronic trading
    platform and other systems. Continued access to these licensors
    and contractors on favorable contract terms or access to
    alternative software and information technology contractors is
    important to our operations. Adverse changes in any of these
    relationships could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations.

We attempt to negotiate favorable pricing, service,
    confidentiality and intellectual property ownership or licensing
    and other terms in our contracts with our service providers.
    These contracts usually have multi-year terms. However, there is
    no guarantee that these contracts will not terminate and that we
    will be able to negotiate successor agreements or agreements
    with alternate service providers on competitive terms. Further,
    the existing agreements may bind us for a period of time to
    terms and technology that become obsolete as our industry and
    our competitors advance their own operations and contracts.

Our
    success depends on maintaining the integrity of our electronic
    trading platform, systems and infrastructure; our computer
    systems may suffer failures, capacity constraints and business
    interruptions that could increase our operating costs and cause
    us to lose clients.

In order to be successful, we must provide reliable, real-time
    access to our electronic trading platform for our broker-dealer
    and institutional investor clients. If our electronic trading
    platform is hampered by slow delivery times, unreliable service
    or insufficient capacity, our broker-dealer and institutional
    investor clients may decide to stop using our platform, which
    would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

As our operations grow in both size and scope, we will need to
    improve and upgrade our electronic trading platform and
    infrastructure to accommodate potential increases in order
    message volume and trading volume, the trading practices of new
    and existing clients, regulatory changes and the development of
    new and enhanced trading platform features, functionalities and
    ancillary products and services. The expansion of our electronic
    trading platform and infrastructure has required, and will
    continue to require, substantial financial, operational and
    technical resources. These resources will typically need to be
    committed well in advance of any actual increase in trading
    volumes and order messages. We cannot assure you that our
    estimates of future trading volumes and order messages will be
    accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate
    actual trading volumes and order messages without failure or
    degradation of performance. Furthermore, we use new technologies
    to upgrade our established systems, and the development of these
    new technologies also entails technical, financial and business



risks. We cannot assure you that we will successfully implement
    new technologies or adapt our existing electronic trading
    platform, technology and systems to the requirements of our
    broker-dealer and institutional investor clients or to emerging
    industry standards. The inability of our electronic trading
    platform to accommodate increasing trading volume and order
    messages would also constrain our ability to expand our business.

We cannot assure you that we will not experience systems
    failures. Our electronic trading platform, computer and
    communication systems and other operations are vulnerable to
    damage, interruption or failure as a result of, among other
    things:

•

irregular or heavy use of our electronic trading platform during
    peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility;

•

power or telecommunications failures, hardware failures or
    software errors;

•

human error;

•

computer viruses, acts of vandalism or sabotage (and resulting
    potential lapses in security), both internal and external;

•

natural disasters, fires, floods or other acts of God;

•

acts of war or terrorism or other armed hostility; and

•

loss of support services from third parties, including those to
    whom we outsource aspects of our computer infrastructure
    critical to our business.

In the event that any of our systems, or those of our
    third-party providers, fail or operate slowly, it may cause any
    one or more of the following to occur:

•

unanticipated disruptions in service to our clients;

•

slower response times or delays in our clients’ trade
    execution;

•

incomplete or inaccurate accounting, recording or processing of
    trades;

•

financial losses and liabilities to clients;

•

litigation or other claims against us, including formal
    complaints to industry regulatory organizations; and

•

regulatory inquiries, proceedings or sanctions.

Any system failure that causes an interruption in service or
    decreases the responsiveness of our service, including failures
    caused by client error or misuse of our systems, could damage
    our reputation, business and brand name and lead our
    broker-dealer and institutional investor clients to decrease or
    cease their use of our electronic trading platform.

In these circumstances, our redundant systems or disaster
    recovery plans may not be adequate. Similarly, although many of
    our contracts with our service providers require them to have
    disaster recovery plans, we cannot be certain that these will be
    adequate or implemented properly. In addition, our business
    interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for
    losses that may occur.

We also cannot assure you that we have sufficient personnel to
    properly respond to system problems. We internally support and
    maintain many of our computer systems and networks, including
    those underlying our electronic trading platform. Our failure to
    monitor or maintain these systems and networks or, if necessary,
    to find a replacement for this technology in a timely and
    cost-effective manner would have a material adverse effect on
    our business, financial condition and results of operations.



If our
    security measures are breached and unauthorized access is
    obtained to our electronic trading platform, broker-dealers and
    institutional investors may become hesitant to use, or reduce or
    stop their use of, our trading platform.

Our electronic trading platform involves the storage and
    transmission of our clients’ proprietary information. The
    secure transmission of confidential information over public
    networks is a critical element of our operations. Security
    breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information,
    litigation and possible liability. If our security measures are
    breached as a result of third-party action, employee error,
    malfeasance or otherwise, and, as a result, someone obtains
    unauthorized access to trading or other confidential
    information, our reputation could be damaged, our business may
    suffer and we could incur significant liability. Because
    techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage
    computer systems change frequently and generally are not
    recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to
    anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive
    measures. If an actual, threatened or perceived breach of our
    security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of
    our security measures could be harmed and could cause our
    broker-dealer and institutional investor clients to reduce or
    stop their use of our electronic trading platform. We may be
    required to expend significant resources to protect against the
    threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems, including
    reputational harm and litigation, caused by any breaches.
    Although we intend to continue to implement industry-standard
    security measures, we cannot assure you that those measures will
    be sufficient.

We may
    not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or
    technology effectively, which would allow competitors to
    duplicate or replicate our electronic trading platform. This
    could adversely affect our ability to compete.

Intellectual property is critical to our success and ability to
    compete, and if we fail to protect our intellectual property
    rights adequately, our competitors might gain access to our
    technology. We rely primarily on a combination of patent,
    copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States
    and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements,
    third-party non-disclosure and other agreements and other
    contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our
    intellectual property rights. We attempt to negotiate beneficial
    intellectual property ownership provisions in our contracts and
    also require employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators
    to enter into confidentiality agreements in order to protect the
    confidentiality of our proprietary information. We have filed
    six patent applications covering aspects of our technology

and/or

business, but can make no assurances that any such patents will
    be issued or, if issued, will protect our business and processes
    from competition. Additionally, laws and our contractual terms
    may not be sufficient to protect our technology from use or
    theft by third parties. For instance, a third party might
    reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our technology
    without our permission and without our knowledge, thereby
    infringing our rights and allowing competitors to duplicate or
    replicate our products. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that
    these protections will be adequate to prevent our competitors
    from independently developing technologies that are
    substantially equivalent or superior to our technology.

We may have legal or contractual rights that we could assert
    against illegal use of our intellectual property rights, but
    lawsuits claiming infringement or misappropriation are complex
    and expensive, and the outcome would not be certain. In
    addition, the laws of some countries in which we now or in the
    future provide our services may not protect software and
    intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of
    the United States.

Defending
    against intellectual property infringement or other claims could
    be expensive and disruptive to our business. If we are found to
    infringe the proprietary rights of others, we could be required
    to redesign our products, pay royalties or enter into license
    agreements with third parties.

In the technology industry, there is frequent litigation based
    on allegations of infringement or other violations of
    intellectual property rights. As the number of participants in
    our market increases and the number of patents and other
    intellectual property registrations increases, the possibility
    of an intellectual property claim against us grows. Although we
    have never been the subject of a material intellectual property
    dispute, we cannot assure you that a third party will not assert
    in the future that our technology or the manner in which we
    operate our business violates its intellectual property rights.
    From time to time, in the ordinary course of our business, we
    may become subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to
    the intellectual property rights of others, and we expect that
    third parties may assert intellectual property claims against
    us, particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our



business, the number of electronic trading platforms increases
    and the functionality of these platforms further overlaps. Any
    claims, whether with or without merit, could:

•

be expensive and time-consuming to defend;

•

prevent us from operating our business, or portions of our
    business;

•

cause us to cease developing, licensing or using all or any part
    of our electronic trading platform that incorporates the
    challenged intellectual property;

•

require us to redesign our products or services, which may not
    be feasible;

•

result in significant monetary liability;

•

divert management’s attention and resources; and

•

require us to pay royalties or enter into licensing agreements
    in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies,
    which may not be possible on commercially reasonable terms.

We cannot assure you that third parties will not assert
    infringement claims against us in the future with respect to our
    electronic trading platform or any of our other current or
    future products or services or that any such assertion will not
    require us to cease providing such services or products, try to
    redesign our products or services, enter into royalty
    arrangements, if available, or engage in litigation that could
    be costly to us. Any of these events could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

If we
    acquire or invest in other businesses, products or technologies,
    we may be unable to integrate them with our business, our
    financial performance may be impaired or we may not realize the
    anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such
    transactions.

If appropriate opportunities present themselves, we may acquire
    or make investments in businesses, products or technologies that
    we believe are strategic. We may not be able to identify,
    negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment
    successfully. Even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in
    a business, product or technology, such acquisitions and
    investments involve a number of risks, including:

•

we may find that the acquired company or assets do not further
    our business strategy, or that we overpaid for the company or
    assets, or the economic conditions underlying our acquisition
    decision may change;

•

we may have difficulty integrating the acquired technologies or
    products with our existing electronic trading platform, products
    and services;

•

we may have difficulty integrating the operations and personnel
    of the acquired business, or retaining the key personnel of the
    acquired business;

•

there may be client confusion if our services overlap with those
    of the acquired company;

•

our ongoing business and management’s attention may be
    disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and
    the complexity of managing geographically or culturally diverse
    enterprises;

•

we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards, controls,
    procedures and policies across locations;

•

an acquisition may result in litigation from terminated
    employees or third parties; and

•

we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated
    with product quality, technology and legal contingencies.

These factors could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or
    multiple acquisitions in a short period of time. From time to
    time, we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or
    investments that are not ultimately consummated. Such
    negotiations could result in significant diversion of management
    time, as well as out-of-pocket costs.

The consideration paid in connection with an investment or
    acquisition also affects our financial results. If we were to
    proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the
    consideration included cash, we could be



required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to
    consummate any acquisition. To the extent we issue shares of
    capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock,
    including options or other rights, existing stockholders may be
    diluted and earnings per share may decrease. In addition,
    acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt, large
    one-time write-offs, such as of acquired in-process research and
    development costs, and restructuring charges. They may also
    result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject
    to impairment tests, which could result in future impairment
    charges.

We are
    dependent on our management team, and the loss of any key member
    of this team may prevent us from implementing our business plan
    in a timely manner.

Our success depends largely upon the continued services of our
    executive officers and other key personnel, particularly Richard
    M. McVey, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of
    Directors. The terms of Mr. McVey’s employment
    agreement with us do not require him to continue to work for us
    and allow him to terminate his employment at any time, subject
    to certain notice requirements and forfeiture of non-vested
    equity options, performance shares and restricted stock. Any
    loss or interruption of Mr. McVey’s services or that
    of one or more of our other executive officers or key personnel
    could result in our inability to manage our operations
    effectively

and/or

pursue our business strategy.

Because
    competition for our employees is intense, we may not be able to
    attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to
    support our business.

We strive to provide high-quality services that will allow us to
    establish and maintain long-term relationships with our
    broker-dealer and institutional investor clients. Our ability to
    provide these services and maintain these relationships, as well
    as our ability to execute our business plan generally, depends
    in large part upon our employees. We must attract and retain
    highly qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel is
    intense, especially for software engineers with extensive
    experience in designing and developing software and
    Internet-related services, hardware engineers, technicians,
    product managers and senior sales executives.

The market for qualified personnel has grown more competitive in
    recent periods as electronic commerce has experienced growth.
    Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced
    personnel have greater resources than we have and are longer
    established in the marketplace. In addition, in making
    employment decisions, particularly in the Internet,
    high-technology and financial services industries, job
    candidates often consider the total compensation package
    offered, including the value of the stock- based compensation
    they are to receive in connection with their employment.
    Significant volatility in the price of our common stock may
    adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees.
    The expensing of stock-based compensation may discourage us from
    granting the size or type of stock-based compensation that job
    candidates may require to join our company.

We cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts
    to recruit and retain the required personnel. The failure to
    attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current
    personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

Termination
    of employees may result in additional costs

We are currently involved in arbitration claims filed by two
    former employees. We believe that both cases are without merit
    and we intend to vigorously defend them. However, an adverse
    settlement or judgment related to those or similar types of
    claims may have an adverse effect on our financial condition or
    results of operations. Regardless of the outcome of these
    claims, we may incur significant expense and management time
    dealing with such claims.

Our
    business is subject to increasingly extensive government and
    other regulation and our relationships with our broker-dealer
    clients may subject us to increasing regulatory
    scrutiny.

The financial industry is extensively regulated by many
    governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations,
    including the SEC and FINRA. As a matter of public policy, these
    regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding the integrity
    of the securities and other financial markets and protecting the
    interests of investors in those markets. These regulatory bodies
    have broad powers to promulgate and interpret, investigate and
    sanction non-compliance with their laws, rules and regulations.



Most aspects of our broker-dealer subsidiaries are highly
    regulated, including:

•

the way we deal with our clients;

•

our capital requirements;

•

our financial and regulatory reporting practices;

•

required record-keeping and record retention procedures;

•

the licensing of our employees; and

•

the conduct of our directors, officers, employees and affiliates.

We cannot assure you that we

and/or

our
    directors, officers and employees will be able to fully comply
    with these laws, rules and regulations. If we fail to comply
    with any of these laws, rules or regulations, we may be subject
    to censure, fines,

cease-and-desist

orders, suspension of our business, suspensions of personnel or
    other sanctions, including revocation of our membership in FINRA
    and registration as a broker-dealer.

We have two major operating subsidiaries, MarketAxess
    Corporation and MarketAxess Europe Limited. MarketAxess
    Corporation and MarketAxess Europe Limited are subject to
    U.S. and U.K. regulations as a registered broker-dealer and
    as a multilateral trading facility, respectively, which prohibit
    repayment of borrowings from the Company or affiliates, paying
    cash dividends, making loans to the Company or affiliates or
    otherwise entering into transactions that result in a
    significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial
    resources, without prior notification to or approval from such
    subsidiary’s principal regulator.

Changes in laws or regulations or in governmental policies,
    including the rules relating to the maintenance of specific
    levels of net capital applicable to our broker-dealer
    subsidiaries, could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations. Our
    industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory
    changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in
    the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations, which
    could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause
    the development of affected markets to become impractical. In
    addition, as we expand our business into new markets, it is
    likely that we will be subject to additional laws, rules and
    regulations. We cannot predict the extent to which any future
    regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and
    operations.

Our disclosed trading system has not been subjected to
    regulation as an alternative trading system under
    Regulation ATS. A determination by the SEC to treat our
    trading platform as an alternative trading system subject to
    Regulation ATS would subject us to additional reporting
    obligations and other limitations on the conduct of our
    business, many of which could be material. Our anonymous
    dealer-to-dealer trading service,
    DealerAxess

®

,
    is regulated as an alternative trading system subject to
    Regulation ATS.

As an enterprise founded and historically controlled by
    broker-dealer competitors, we may be subject to ongoing
    regulatory scrutiny of our business to a degree that is not
    likely to be experienced by some of our competitors. In November
    2000, we received a Civil Investigative Demand from the
    U.S. Department of Justice in connection with the Antitrust
    Division’s investigation of electronic bond and other
    consortia trading systems. After compliance with all information
    requests, we received notice from the U.S. Department of
    Justice in 2004 that the investigation had been officially
    closed. As the use of our electronic trading platform grows and
    represents a greater share of the trading volume of fixed-income
    securities, the risk that other regulatory investigations could
    commence in the future increases. Additionally, the involvement
    of individuals affiliated with certain of our broker-dealer
    clients on our Board of Directors and as stockholders may
    subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny of our business. At
    any time, the outcome of investigations and other regulatory
    scrutiny could lead to compulsory changes to our business model,
    conduct or practices, or our relationships with our
    broker-dealer clients, or additional governmental scrutiny or
    private lawsuits against us, any of which could materially harm
    our revenues, impair our ability to provide access to the
    broadest range of fixed-income securities and impact our ability
    to grow and compete effectively, particularly as we implement
    new initiatives designed to enhance our competitive position.

The activities and consequences described above may result in
    significant distractions to our management and could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.



We
    expect to continue to expand our operations outside of the
    United States; however, we may face special economic and
    regulatory challenges that we may not be able to
    meet.

We operate an electronic trading platform in Europe and we plan
    to further expand our operations throughout Europe and other
    regions. There are certain risks inherent in doing business in
    international markets, particularly in the financial services
    industry, which is heavily regulated in many jurisdictions
    outside the United States. These risks include:

•

less developed technological infrastructures and generally
    higher costs, which could result in lower client acceptance of
    our services or clients having difficulty accessing our trading
    platform;

•

difficulty in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals for
    planned expansion, if at all, and the possibility that any
    approvals that are obtained may impose restrictions on the
    operation of our business;

•

the inability to manage and coordinate the various regulatory
    requirements of multiple jurisdictions that are constantly
    evolving and subject to unexpected change;

•

difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;

•

fluctuations in exchange rates;

•

reduced or no protection for intellectual property rights;

•

seasonal reductions in business activity; and

•

potentially adverse tax consequences.

Our inability to manage these risks effectively could adversely
    affect our business and limit our ability to expand our
    international operations, which could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

We
    cannot predict our future capital needs or our ability to obtain
    additional financing if we need it.

Our business is dependent upon the availability of adequate
    funding and regulatory capital under applicable regulatory
    requirements. Historically, we have satisfied these needs
    primarily through equity financing from certain of our
    broker-dealer clients, our acquisition of Trading Edge, Inc.,
    internally generated funds and our initial public offering.
    Although we believe that our available cash resources are
    sufficient to meet our presently anticipated liquidity needs and
    capital expenditure requirements for at least the next
    12 months, we may in the future need to raise additional
    funds to, among other things:

•

support more rapid growth of our business;

•

develop new or enhanced services and products;

•

respond to competitive pressures;

•

acquire complementary companies or technologies;

•

enter into strategic alliances;

•

increase the regulatory net capital necessary to support our
    operations; or

•

respond to unanticipated capital requirements.

We may not be able to obtain additional financing, if needed, in
    amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Our existing
    investors, including our broker-dealer clients and their
    affiliates, have no obligation to make further investments in
    us, and we do not anticipate that they will do so. If sufficient
    funds are not available or are not available on terms acceptable
    to us, our ability to fund our expansion, take advantage of
    acquisition opportunities, develop or enhance our services or
    products, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be
    significantly limited. These limitations could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.



The
    requirements of being a public company may strain our resources,
    divert management’s attention and affect our ability to
    attract and retain qualified board members.

As a public company, we are subject to the reporting
    requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and NASDAQ rules promulgated in
    response to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The requirements of these
    rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial
    compliance costs, made some activities more difficult,
    time-consuming or costly and may place undue strain on our
    systems and resources. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934
    requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and
    current reports with respect to our business and financial
    condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things,
    that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures
    and internal controls for financial reporting. In order to
    maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure
    controls and procedures and internal control over financial
    reporting, significant resources and management oversight are
    required. As a result, management’s attention may be
    diverted from other business concerns, which could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

These rules and regulations could also make it more difficult
    for us to attract and retain qualified independent members of
    our Board of Directors. Additionally, we expect these rules and
    regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us
    to obtain director and officer liability insurance. We may be
    required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially
    higher costs to obtain coverage. NASDAQ rules also require that
    a majority of our Board of Directors and all of certain
    sub-committees of the Board of Directors consist of independent
    directors. We cannot assure you that our Board of Directors will
    continue to include a majority of independent directors to
    comply with the requirements of these rules.

We are
    subject to the risks of litigation and securities laws
    liability.

Many aspects of our business, and the businesses of our clients,
    involve substantial risks of liability. Dissatisfied clients may
    make claims regarding quality of trade execution, improperly
    settled trades, mismanagement or even fraud against their
    service providers. We and our clients may become subject to
    these claims as the result of failures or malfunctions of our
    electronic trading platform and services provided by us. We
    could incur significant legal expenses defending claims, even
    those without merit. An adverse resolution of any lawsuits or
    claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations.

Risks
    Related to Our Industry

If the
    use of electronic trading platforms does not continue to
    increase, we will not be able to achieve our business
    objectives.

The success of our business plan depends on our ability to
    create an electronic trading platform for a wide range of
    fixed-income products. Historically, fixed-income securities
    markets operated through telephone communications between
    institutional investors and broker-dealers. The utilization of
    our products and services depends on the acceptance, adoption
    and growth of electronic means of trading securities. We cannot
    assure you that the growth and acceptance of electronic means of
    trading securities will continue.

Economic,
    political and market factors beyond our control could reduce
    demand for our services and harm our business, and our
    profitability could suffer.

The global financial services business is, by its nature, risky
    and volatile and is directly affected by many national and
    international factors that are beyond our control. Any one of
    these factors may cause a substantial decline in the
    U.S. and global financial services markets, resulting in
    reduced trading volume. These events could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations. These factors include:

•

economic and political conditions in the United States and
    elsewhere;

•

adverse market conditions, including unforeseen market closures
    or other disruptions in trading;

•

actual or threatened acts of war or terrorism or other armed
    hostilities;



•

concerns over inflation and weakening consumer confidence levels;

•

the availability of cash for investment by mutual funds and
    other wholesale and retail investors;

•

the level and volatility of interest and foreign currency
    exchange rates; and

•

legislative and regulatory changes.

Any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced
    activity and prices in the securities markets generally. Our
    revenues and profitability are likely to decline significantly
    during periods of stagnant economic conditions or low trading
    volume in the U.S. and global financial markets.

Legal
    Proceedings

In January 2007, two former employees commenced arbitration
    proceedings against MarketAxess Corporation before FINRA arising
    out of the expiration of certain vested and unvested stock
    options and unvested restricted shares issued to them. In April
    2007, one of those former employees brought a separate FINRA
    arbitration against MarketAxess Holdings Inc. based on the same
    claim he had filed against MarketAxess Corporation. The
    arbitrations brought by that employee against both MarketAxess
    Corporation and MarketAxess Holdings Inc. have been consolidated
    before FINRA. The claims made by these two former employees
    total $4.5 million plus interest.

One former employee has alleged that we wrongfully prevented him
    from exercising his vested options when he sought to do so and
    that we wrongfully claimed that such options had expired on the
    previous day.

The other former employee has alleged that we wrongfully failed
    to accelerate the vesting of his then unvested options and
    restricted shares upon his termination and to waive the

90-day

time
    period within which he was required to exercise his vested
    options. He further alleges that he is entitled to a bonus for
    the approximately five months that he worked for us during 2006.

MarketAxess Corporation answered both arbitration claims brought
    against it. We have vigorously defended the claims brought
    against both MarketAxess Corporation and MarketAxess Holdings
    Inc. Based on currently available information, we believe that
    the likelihood of a material loss is not probable. Accordingly,
    no amounts have been provided in the accompanying financial
    statements. However, arbitration is subject to inherent
    uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur.

On October 26, 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a
    stock repurchase program for up to $40 million of our
    common stock. Shares repurchased under the program will be held
    in treasury for future use. A total of 2,642,714 shares
    were repurchased at an aggregate cost of $37.2 million from
    the inception of the repurchase program through
    December 31, 2007. The stock repurchase program was
    completed in January 2008.



STOCK
    PERFORMANCE GRAPH

The following graph shows a comparison from November 5,
    2004 (the date our common stock commenced trading on the NASDAQ
    Global Select Market) through December 31, 2007 of
    (i) the cumulative total return for our common stock,
    (ii) the NASDAQ Composite Index, (iii) the NASDAQ
    Global Select Market Composite Index, (iv) the Dow Jones US
    Financial Services Index and (v) a peer group that we
    previously used. We believe that the Dow Jones US Financial
    Services Index provides a more meaningful peer group comparison
    of our stock performance. The peer group we are replacing
    consisted of: eSpeed, Inc., GFI Group Inc. and Investment
    Technology Group, Inc.

The NASDAQ Global Select Market Composite Index, introduced in
    July 2006, is a market capitalization weighted index that
    measures all NASDAQ domestic and international based common type
    stocks listed in the Global Select tier of the NASDAQ Stock
    Market. The index carries the index history of the NASDAQ
    National Market Composite Index.

The figures in this graph assume an initial investment of $100
    in our common stock at the closing price of $17.49 on
    November 5, 2004, the date our common stock commenced
    trading on the NASDAQ National Market (now the NASDAQ Global
    Select Market), an initial investment of $100 on
    October 31, 2004 in each of the three indexes and an
    initial investment of $100 in each of the companies in the peer
    group at their respective closing prices on November 5,
    2004.

The returns illustrated below are based on historical results
    during the period indicated and should not be considered
    indicative of future stockholder returns. Data for the NASDAQ
    Composite Index, the NASDAQ Global Select Market Composite
    Index, the Dow Jones US Financial Services Index and the peer
    group assume reinvestment of dividends. We have never paid
    dividends on our common stock and have no present plans to do
    so. All performance data have been provided by Research Data
    Group, Inc.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

You should read the following discussion and analysis of our
    financial condition and results of operations in conjunction
    with “Selected Financial Data” and our consolidated
    financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in
    this

Form 10-K.

In addition to historical information, this discussion and
    analysis contains forward-looking statements relating to future
    events and the future performance of MarketAxess that are based
    on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates and
    projections about us and our industry. These forward-looking
    statements involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results
    and timing of various events could differ materially from those
    anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of a
    variety of factors, as more fully described in this section, in
    “Item 1A. — Risk Factors” and elsewhere
    in this

Form 10-K.

We undertake no obligation to update publicly any
    forward-looking statements for any reason, even if new
    information becomes available or other events occur in the
    future.

Executive
    Summary

MarketAxess operates one of the leading platforms for the
    electronic trading of corporate bonds and certain other types of
    fixed-income securities. Through our platform, 674 active
    institutional investor client firms (firms that executed at
    least one trade through our electronic trading platform between
    January 2007 and December 2007) can access the aggregate
    liquidity provided by the collective interest of our 30
    broker-dealer clients in buying or selling bonds through our
    platform. Our active institutional investor clients include
    investment advisers, mutual funds, insurance companies, public
    and private pension funds, bank portfolios and hedge funds. We
    provide data and analytical tools that help our clients make
    trading decisions, we provide connectivity solutions that
    facilitate the trading process by electronically communicating
    order information between trading counterparties and we provide
    our clients with ancillary technology services. Our revenues are
    primarily generated from the trading of U.S. and European
    high-grade corporate bonds.

Our multi-dealer trading platform allows our institutional
    investor clients to simultaneously request competing, executable
    bids or offers from our broker-dealer clients and execute trades
    with the broker-dealer of their choice from among those that
    choose to respond. We offer our broker-dealer clients a solution
    that enables them to efficiently reach our institutional
    investor clients for the distribution and trading of bonds. In
    addition to U.S. high-grade corporate bonds, European
    high-grade corporate bonds and emerging markets bonds, including
    both investment-grade and non-investment grade debt, we also
    offer our clients the ability to trade crossover and high-yield
    bonds, agency bonds, new issues and credit default swap indices.
    Our
    DealerAxess

®

trading service allows dealers to trade fixed-income securities
    and credit default swaps with each other on our platform.

The majority of our revenues are derived from monthly
    distribution fees and commissions for trades executed on our
    platform that are billed to our broker-dealer clients on a
    monthly basis. We also derive revenues from information and user
    access fees, license fees, investment income and other income,
    which includes fees earned from our technology services
    business. Our expenses consist of employee compensation and
    benefits, depreciation and amortization, technology and
    communication expenses, professional and consulting fees,
    occupancy, marketing and advertising and other general and
    administrative expenses.

We seek to grow and diversify our revenues by capitalizing on
    our status as the operator of a leading platform for the
    electronic trading of corporate bonds and certain other types of
    fixed-income securities. The key elements of our strategy are:

•

to innovate and efficiently add new functionality and product
    offerings to the MarketAxess platform that we believe will help
    to increase our market share with existing clients, as well as
    expand our client base;

•

to leverage our technology, as well as our strong broker-dealer
    and institutional investor relationships, to: deploy our
    electronic trading platform into additional product segments
    within the fixed-income securities markets; deliver fixed-income
    securities-related technical services and products; and deploy
    our electronic trading platform into new client segments;

•

to continue building our existing service offerings so that our
    electronic trading platform is fully integrated into the
    workflow of our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients
    and to continue to add functionality to allow



our clients to achieve a fully automated end-to-end
    straight-through processing solution (automation from trade
    initiation to settlement);

•

to add new content and analytical capabilities to Corporate
    BondTicker

tm

in order to improve the value of the information we provide to
    our clients; and

•

to continue to supplement our internal growth by entering into
    strategic alliances, or acquiring businesses or technologies
    that will enable us to enter new markets, provide new products
    or services, or otherwise enhance the value of our platform to
    our clients.

Critical
    Factors Affecting Our Industry and Our Company

Economic,
    Political and Market Factors

The global fixed-income securities industry is risky and
    volatile and is directly affected by a number of economic,
    political and market factors that may result in declining
    trading volume. These factors could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations. These factors include, among others, credit market
    conditions, the current interest rate environment, including the
    volatility of interest rates and investors’ forecasts of
    future interest rates, and economic and political conditions in
    the United States, Europe and elsewhere.

Competitive
    Landscape

The global fixed-income securities industry generally, and the
    electronic financial services markets in which we engage in
    particular, are highly competitive, and we expect competition to
    intensify in the future. Sources of competition for us will
    continue to include, among others, bond trading conducted
    directly between broker-dealers and their institutional investor
    clients over the telephone or electronically and other
    multi-dealer trading companies. Competitors, including companies
    in which some of our broker-dealer clients have invested, have
    developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their
    intention to explore the development of electronic platforms
    that may compete with us.

In general, we compete on the basis of a number of key factors,
    including, among others, the liquidity provided on our platform,
    the magnitude and frequency of price improvement enabled by our
    platform and the quality and speed of execution. We believe that
    we compete favorably with respect to these factors. Our trading
    volume and client acceptance have grown significantly over the
    past five years and we continue to proactively build technology
    solutions that serve the needs of the credit markets.

Our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and
    integration of our broker-dealer and institutional investor
    clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems.
    We have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we
    serve in the development of our platform, working closely with
    our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs.

Regulatory
    Environment

Our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory
    changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in
    the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations, which
    could require us to incur significant costs.

Our U.S. subsidiary, MarketAxess Corporation, is a
    registered broker-dealer with the SEC and is a member of FINRA.
    Our U.K. subsidiary, MarketAxess Europe Limited, is registered
    as a multilateral trading facility dealer with the FSA in the
    U.K. Both U.S. and U.K. regulations prohibit repayment of
    borrowings from these subsidiaries or their affiliates, paying
    cash dividends, making loans to us or our affiliates or
    otherwise entering into transactions that result in a
    significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial
    resources, without prior notification to or approval from such
    regulated entity’s principal regulator. MarketAxess Canada
    Limited, a Canadian subsidiary that we incorporated in May 2003,
    has applied for registration as an Alternative Trading System
    dealer under the Securities Act of Ontario and is in the process
    of seeking approval for membership with the Investment Dealers
    Association of Canada.



As a public company, we are subject to the reporting
    requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and NASDAQ rules promulgated in
    response to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The requirements of these
    rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial
    compliance costs, made some activities more difficult,
    time-consuming or costly and may also place undue strain on our
    systems and resources. In order to maintain and improve the
    effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and
    internal control over financial reporting, significant resources
    and management oversight are required.

Rapid
    Technological Changes

We must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading
    platform. The electronic financial services industry is
    characterized by increasingly complex systems and
    infrastructures and new business models. Our future success will
    depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and
    services, develop

and/or

license new products and technologies that address the
    increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our broker-dealer
    and institutional investor clients and prospective clients and
    respond to technological advances and emerging industry
    standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis.

Trends in
    Our Business

The majority of our revenues are derived from monthly
    distribution fees and commissions for transactions executed on
    our platform between our institutional investor and
    broker-dealer clients. We believe that there are five key
    variables that impact the notional value of such transactions on
    our platform and the amount of commissions earned by us:

•

the number of institutional investor clients that participate on
    the platform and their willingness to originate transactions
    through the platform;

•

the number of broker-dealer clients on the platform and the
    competitiveness of the prices they provide to the institutional
    investor clients;

•

the number of markets for which we make trading available to our
    clients;

•

the overall level of activity in these markets; and

•

the level of commissions that we collect for trades executed
    through the platform.

We believe that overall corporate bond market trading volume is
    affected by various factors including the absolute levels of
    interest rates, the direction of interest rate movements, the
    level of new issues of corporate bonds and the volatility of
    corporate bond spreads versus U.S. Treasury securities.
    Because a significant percentage of our revenue is tied directly
    to the volume of securities traded on our platform, it is likely
    that a general decline in trading volumes, regardless of the
    cause of such decline, would reduce our revenues and have a
    significant negative impact on profitability.

The second half of 2007 was a period of significant turmoil in
    the U.S. and European credit markets, especially in
    short-term funding and floating rate note instruments. A
    widespread retrenchment in the credit markets resulted in
    increased credit spreads and significantly higher credit spread
    volatility across a wide range of asset classes. The average
    daily trading volume of U.S. high-grade corporate bonds for
    the second half of 2007 decreased by 14% compared to the second
    half of 2006. We believe the resultant lack of liquidity in the
    credit markets led institutional investors to reduce overall
    bond trading activity and conduct a higher percentage of their
    trades directly with their broker-dealer counterparties,
    resulting in lower volumes on our platform. We also believe that
    a stabilization in credit market conditions, at higher overall
    levels of credit spreads, is likely to favorably impact the
    volume of trades conducted over our platform.

We have historically earned a substantial portion of our
    commissions and overall revenues from broker-dealer clients that
    are (or whose affiliates are) our stockholders. For 2007, a
    total of seven dealers, and for 2006 and 2005, a total of nine
    dealers, were considered to be Stockholder Broker-Dealer
    Clients. The percentage of our revenues derived from our
    Stockholder Broker-Dealer Clients has been declining due to the
    sale of shares of our common stock since our initial public
    offering in November 2004 by several of our founding dealers.
    For the year ended December 31, 2007, the percentage
    decreased to 37.1% from 46.0% for the year ended
    December 31, 2006.



Affiliates of most of our broker-dealer clients are also among
    our institutional investor clients. A table detailing the amount
    of our revenues generated by the Stockholder Broker-Dealer
    Clients and their respective affiliates, as well as the
    corresponding percentage of the respective revenue line item, is
    provided below for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006

Commission
    Revenue Trends

Commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the
    notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platform and vary
    based on the type, size, yield and maturity of the bond traded.
    The commission rates are based on a number of factors, including
    fees charged by inter-dealer brokers in the respective markets,
    average bid-offer spreads in the products we offer and
    transaction costs through alternative channels including the
    telephone. Under our transaction fee plans, bonds that are more
    actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally
    charged lower commissions, while bonds that are less actively
    traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher
    commissions.

U.S. High-Grade Corporate Bond
    Commissions.

On June 1, 2005, we introduced
    a new fee plan primarily for secondary market transactions in
    U.S. high-grade corporate bonds executed on our
    institutional client to multi-dealer electronic trading
    platform. The fee plan incorporates higher fixed monthly fees
    and lower variable fees for our broker-dealer clients than the
    previous U.S. high-grade corporate transaction fee plans
    and incorporates volume incentives to our broker-dealer clients
    that are designed to increase the volume of transactions
    effected on our platform. Under the fee plan, we electronically
    add the variable fee to the spread quoted by the broker-dealer
    client but do not charge for inquiries that an institutional
    investor client sends to a single broker-dealer client. The
    combination of higher fixed and lower variable fees in the plan
    results in higher total revenue to us at current or lower volume
    levels. If volume grows, total revenues could be less under the
    new plan than the previous plan due to the lower variable fees.
    For trades on our
    DealerAxess

®

dealer-to-dealer electronic trading platform, we typically
    charge a fee to the broker-dealer client involved in the
    transaction that is based on the size of the transaction and the
    maturity of the bond traded. Monthly minimum fees applied to
    certain dealers participating on the
    DealerAxess

®

platform in their first year of trading. The majority of the
    DealerAxess

®

monthly minimum commitments expired as of June 30, 2007.

European High-Grade Corporate Bond
    Commissions.

On June 1, 2007, we introduced
    a new fee plan for European high-grade corporate bond trades for
    the majority of our European dealers. Similar to the
    U.S. high-grade plan, the new European high-grade corporate
    bond fee plan incorporates fixed monthly fees and a variable fee
    that is lower than the transaction fee under the previous
    European high-grade plan and incorporates incentives to our
    broker-dealer clients that are designed to increase the volume
    of transactions effected on our platform. The variable



fee under the new plan is dependent on the type of bond traded
    and the maturity of the issue. The combination of the fixed and
    variable fees in the new plan results in higher total revenue to
    us at current or lower volume levels. If volume grows, total
    revenues could be less under the new plan than the previous plan
    due to the lower variable fees. Under the fee plan in effect
    prior to June 1, 2007, broker-dealer transaction fees
    varied based on the type of bond traded and the maturity of the
    issue. This fee schedule applied a tiered fee structure, which
    reduced the fee per trade upon the attainment of certain
    specified amounts of monthly commissions generated by a
    particular broker-dealer and did not carry a fixed monthly fee.

Other Commissions.

Commissions for other bond
    and credit default swap trades generally vary based on the type
    and the maturity of the instrument traded. We generally operate
    using standard fee schedules that may include both variable
    transaction fees and fixed monthly fees that are charged to the
    participating dealers.

We anticipate that some reduction in average fees per million
    may occur in the future. Consequently, past trends in
    commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions.

Other
    Revenue Trends

In addition to the commissions discussed above, we earn revenue
    from information services fees paid by institutional investor
    and broker-dealer clients, license fees, income on investments
    and other services.

Information and User Access Fees.

We charge
    information services fees for Corporate
    BondTicker

TM

to our broker-dealer clients, institutional investor clients and
    data-only subscribers. The information services fee is a flat
    monthly fee, based on the level of service. We also generate
    information services fees from the sale of bulk data to certain
    institutional investor clients and data-only subscribers.
    Institutional investor clients trading U.S. high-grade
    corporate bonds are charged a monthly user access fee for the
    use of our platform. The fee, billed quarterly, is charged to
    the client based on the number of the client’s users. To
    encourage institutional investor clients to execute trades on
    our U.S. high-grade corporate bond platform, we reduce
    these information and user access fees for such clients once
    minimum quarterly trading volumes are attained.

License Fees.

License fees consist of fees
    received from broker-dealer clients for access to our trading
    platform through a non-exclusive and non-transferable license.
    Broker-dealer clients generally pay an initial license fee,
    which is typically due and payable upon execution of the
    broker-dealer agreement. The initial license fee varies by
    agreement and at a minimum is intended to cover the initial

set-up

costs
    incurred to enable a broker-dealer to begin using our electronic
    trading platform. The license fee is recognized in the first
    three months of the agreement in the estimated amount of the

set-up

costs
    that we incur and the remaining amount is amortized over the
    initial term of the agreement, which is generally three years.
    We anticipate that license fees will be an insignificant source
    of revenues for us on a going-forward basis.

Investment Income.

Investment income consists
    of income earned on our investments.

Other.

Other revenues consist of
    telecommunications line charges to broker-dealer clients and
    other miscellaneous revenues. In 2007, we also began providing
    technology consulting services and, through our acquisition of
    TWS in November 2007, certain connectivity solutions.

Expense
    Trends

In the normal course of business, we incur the following
    expenses:

Employee Compensation and Benefits.

Employee
    compensation and benefits is our most significant expense and
    includes employee salaries, stock compensation costs, other
    incentive compensation, employee benefits and payroll taxes.
    Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS 123R, which requires the measurement and recognition
    of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made
    to employees based on estimated fair values.

Depreciation and Amortization.

We depreciate
    our computer hardware and related software, office hardware and
    furniture and fixtures and amortize our capitalized software
    development costs on a straight-line basis over a three-year
    period. We amortize leasehold improvements on a straight-line
    basis over the lesser of the life of the improvement or the
    remaining term of the lease.



Technology and Communications.

Technology and
    communications expense consists primarily of costs relating to
    maintenance on software and hardware, our internal network
    connections, data center hosting costs and data feeds provided
    by outside vendors or service providers. The majority of our
    broker-dealer clients have dedicated high-speed communication
    lines to our network in order to provide fast data transfer. We
    charge our broker-dealer clients a monthly fee for these
    connections, which is recovered against the relevant expenses we
    incur.

Professional and Consulting Fees.

Professional
    and consulting fees consist primarily of accounting fees, legal
    fees and fees paid to information technology and non-information
    technology consultants for services provided for the maintenance
    of our trading platform and information services products.

Occupancy.

Occupancy costs consist primarily
    of office and equipment rent, utilities and commercial rent tax.

Marketing and Advertising.

Marketing and
    advertising expense consists primarily of print and other
    advertising expenses we incur to promote our products and
    services. This expense also includes costs associated with
    attending or exhibiting at industry-sponsored seminars,
    conferences and conventions, and travel and entertainment
    expenses incurred by our sales force to promote our trading
    platform and information services.

General and Administrative.

General and
    administrative expense consists primarily of general travel and
    entertainment, board of directors expenses, charitable
    contributions, provision for doubtful accounts, and various
    state franchise and U.K. value-added taxes.

We anticipate expense growth in the future, primarily due to
    investment in new products, notably in employee compensation and
    benefits, professional and consulting fees, and general and
    administrative expense, but we believe that operating leverage
    can be achieved by increasing volumes in existing products and
    adding new products without substantial additions to our
    infrastructure.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations discusses our Consolidated
    Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States, also referred to as U.S. GAAP. The preparation of
    these financial statements requires management to make estimates
    and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses
    during the reporting periods. We base our estimates and
    judgments on historical experience and on various other factors
    that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
    results may differ from these estimates under varying
    assumptions or conditions. Note 2 of the Notes to our
    Consolidated Financial Statements includes a summary of the
    significant accounting policies and methods used in the
    preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Use of
    Estimates

On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and
    judgments, particularly as they relate to accounting policies
    that management believes are critical. That is, these accounting
    policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial
    condition and results of operations and they require
    management’s most difficult, subjective or complex
    judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about
    the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

We continually monitor collections and payments from our
    customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts. The
    allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the historical
    collection experience and specific collection issues that have
    been identified.

Software
    Development Costs

We capitalize certain costs associated with the development of
    internal use software at the point at which the conceptual
    formulation, design and testing of possible software project
    alternatives have been completed. We



capitalize employee compensation and related benefits and third
    party consulting costs incurred during the preliminary software
    project stage. Once the product is ready for its intended use,
    such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over three
    years. We review the amounts capitalized for impairment whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    amounts of the assets may not be recoverable.

Revenue
    Recognition

The majority of our revenues are derived from monthly
    distribution fees and commissions for trades executed on our
    platform that are billed to our broker-dealer clients on a
    monthly basis. We also derive revenues from information and user
    access fees, license fees, investment income and other services.
    Other income includes revenues from technology licenses,
    maintenance and consulting services. Commissions are generally
    calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of
    bonds traded on the platform and vary based on the type and
    maturity of the bond traded. Under our transaction fee plans,
    bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter
    maturities are generally charged lower commissions, while bonds
    that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities
    generally command higher commissions.

We enter into agreements with our broker-dealer clients pursuant
    to which we provide access to our platform through a
    non-exclusive and non-transferable license. Broker-dealer
    clients generally pay an initial license fee, which is typically
    due and payable upon execution of the broker-dealer agreement.
    The initial license fee varies by agreement and at a minimum is
    intended to cover the initial

set-up

costs
    incurred to enable a broker-dealer to begin using our electronic
    trading platform. Revenue is recognized in the first three
    months of the agreement in the estimated amount of the

set-up

costs
    incurred (50% in the first month, 40% in the second month and
    10% in the third month), and the remaining amount is deferred
    and recognized ratably over the initial term of the agreement,
    which is generally three years. We anticipate that license fees
    will be an insignificant source of revenues on a going-forward
    basis.

Revenues from contracts for technology integration consulting
    services are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method
    in accordance with Statement of Position

81-1,

“Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and
    Certain Production-Type Contracts.”
    Percentage-of-completion accounting involves calculating the
    percentage of services provided during the reporting period
    compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the
    duration of the contract. If estimates indicate that a contract
    loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in
    which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable.
    Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the
    estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the
    estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract.
    There were no contract loss provisions recorded as of
    December 31, 2007. Revenues recognized in excess of
    billings are recorded as unbilled services. Billings in excess
    of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenues until
    revenue recognition criteria are met.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

We measure and recognize compensation expense for all
    share-based payment awards in accordance with SFAS 123R.
    This statement requires that compensation expense for all
    share-based awards be recognized based on their estimated fair
    values measured as of the grant date. These costs are recognized
    as an expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over
    the requisite service period, which is typically the vesting
    period, with an offsetting increase to additional paid-in
    capital. We adopted SFAS 123R using the modified
    prospective transition method effective January 1, 2006.

Income
    Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability
    method in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
    “Accounting for Income Taxes”
    (“SFAS 109”). Deferred income taxes reflect the
    net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial
    reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are
    measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in
    effect when such differences are expected to reverse. The effect
    on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
    is recognized in income in the period that includes the
    enactment date. A valuation allowance is recognized against
    deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such
    assets will not be realized in future years.



In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”
    (“FIN 48”), which applies to all tax positions
    accounted for under SFAS 109. A “tax position”
    includes current or future reductions in taxable income reported
    or expected to be reported on a tax return. FIN 48
    supplements SFAS 109 by defining the confidence level that
    a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the
    financial statements. The interpretation requires that the tax
    effects of a position be recognized only if it is
    “more-likely-than-not” (i.e., greater than 50%
    likelihood) to be sustained based solely on its technical merits
    as of the reporting date. In making this assessment, a company
    must assume that the taxing authorities will examine the
    position. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48
    effective January 1, 2007, we recognized an increase in
    deferred tax assets of $3.0 million related to previously
    unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as an
    increase to additional paid-in capital of $0.3 million and
    an increase in accrued expenses of $2.7 million.
    Unrecognized tax benefits as of January 1, 2007 and
    December 31, 2007 were $2.7 million. If recognized,
    this entire amount would impact the effective tax rate. In
    accordance with FIN 48, certain deferred tax assets
    aggregating $14.1 million were no longer recognized and the
    related valuation allowance was reversed.

Business
    Combinations, Goodwill and Intangibles Assets

We account for business acquisitions under the purchase method
    of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141,
    “Business Combinations.” The total cost of an
    acquisition is allocated to the underlying net assets based on
    their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the
    purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets
    acquired is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of
    certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in
    nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and
    assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash
    flows, discount rates, growth rates and asset lives.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets,” we no longer amortize goodwill
    and other intangibles with indefinite lives. We perform an
    impairment review of goodwill on an annual basis and more
    frequently if circumstances change. Intangible assets with
    definite lives, including purchased technology and other
    intangible assets, are amortized on a straight-line basis over
    their estimated useful lives of five years. Intangible assets
    are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances
    indicate a possible impairment pursuant to the provisions of
    SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for Long Lived Assets
    and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of.”

Segment
    Results

As an electronic, multi-dealer platform for trading fixed-income
    securities, our operations constitute a single business segment
    pursuant to SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about
    Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.” Because
    of the highly integrated nature of the financial markets in
    which we compete and the integration of our worldwide business
    activities, we believe that results by geographic region,
    products or types of clients are not necessarily meaningful in
    understanding our business.

Overview

Total revenues increased by $10.3 million or 12.4% to
    $93.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    from $83.3 million for the year ended December 31,
    2006. This increase in total revenues was primarily due to
    increases in total commissions of $8.8 million, other
    income of $0.7 million and investment income of
    $0.6 million.

Total expenses increased by $1.7 million or 2.2% to
    $76.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    from $74.7 million for the year ended December 31,
    2006. This increase was primarily due to higher employee
    compensation and benefits of $1.0 million.

Income before taxes increased by $8.6 million or 100.5% to
    $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    from $8.6 million for the year ended December 31,

U.S. high-grade volume increased by 7.1% for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2006. The increase in U.S. high-grade
    volume was due primarily to an improvement in the Company’s
    estimated market share of total U.S. high-grade corporate
    bond volume as reported by FINRA TRACE from 8.5% for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 to 9.4% for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, offset by a decline in overall market
    volume as measured by FINRA TRACE. Estimated FINRA TRACE
    U.S. high-grade volume decreased by 3.0% from
    $2,295 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 to
    $2,227 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007.
    We believe that the credit market turmoil experienced in the
    second half of 2007 negatively impacted overall FINRA TRACE
    volume. The fixed monthly U.S. high-grade distribution fees
    were $31.5 million for the year ended December, 2007,
    compared to $29.8 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. The
    DealerAxess

®

monthly minimum fees were $3.5 million and
    $2.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. The majority of the
    DealerAxess

®

minimum fee commitments expired as of June 30, 2007. The
    total U.S. high-grade average fee per million is calculated
    for each period presented using both the variable transaction
    fees and the fixed monthly distribution fees, including the
    DealerAxess

®

monthly minimum fees, paid by our broker-dealer clients. The
    variable U.S. high-grade average fee per million increased
    due to the longer maturity of trades executed on the platform,
    for which we charge higher commissions.

European high-grade volume decreased by 11.6%, net of the
    favorable effect of foreign currency changes, for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2006. During the second half of 2007, we
    believe that the European credit markets experienced market
    conditions similar to the U.S. On June 1, 2007, we
    introduced a new fee plan for European high-grade corporate bond
    trades. Similar to the U.S. high-grade plan, the new
    European high-grade corporate bond fee plan incorporates a fixed
    monthly fee and a variable fee that is dependent on the type of
    bond traded and the maturity of the issue. The fixed monthly
    European high-grade distribution fee was $8.1 million for
    year ended December 31, 2007. The total European high-grade
    average fee per million is calculated for each period presented
    using both the variable transaction fees and the fixed monthly
    distribution fees paid by our broker-dealer clients. The
    decrease in the variable European high-grade average fee per
    million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to
    the year ended December 31, 2006 resulted principally from
    the introduction of the new European high-grade fee plan.

Other volume increased by 29.5% for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher
    credit default swap, high-yield and agencies volume. Other
    average fee per million declined primarily due to higher volume
    in products which carry lower fees per million, including credit
    default swap indexes and agencies.

Information and User Access Fees.

Information
    and user access fees increased by $0.4 million or 7.3% to
    $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from
    $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.
    This increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of

License Fees.

License fees decreased by
    $0.2 million or 20.6% to $0.7 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 from $0.9 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006. This decrease was attributable to
    a decline in the amortization of previously received license
    fees. We anticipate that license fees will be an insignificant
    source of revenues for us on a going-forward basis.

Investment Income.

Investment income increased
    by $0.6 million or 14.1% to $5.2 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 from $4.6 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily due to
    higher cash and cash equivalents and securities
    available-for-sale balances and a rise in interest rates during
    the year ended December 31, 2007.

Other.

Other revenues increased by
    $0.7 million or 71.1% to $1.6 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 from $0.9 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006. Other revenues in 2007 included
    $0.6 million in revenue recognized under a technology
    development contract with a broker-dealer client.

Employee Compensation and Benefits.

Employee
    compensation and benefits increased by $1.0 million or 2.3%
    to $43.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    from $42.1 million for the year ended December 31,
    2006. This increase was primarily attributable to higher
    incentive compensation costs of $2.6 million and employee
    benefits and payroll taxes of $1.0 million, offset by a
    reduction in employee severance costs of $1.3 million,
    salary expense of $1.1 million and stock compensation costs
    of $0.7 million. The total number of employees increased to
    182 as of December 31, 2007 from 176 as of
    December 31, 2006. As a percentage of total revenues,
    employee compensation and benefits expense decreased to 46.0%
    for the year ended December 31, 2007 from 50.5% for the
    year ended December 31, 2006.

Depreciation and Amortization.

Depreciation
    and amortization expense increased by $0.4 million or 6.6%
    to $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    from $6.7 million for the year ended December 31,
    2006. This increase was attributable to increased amortization
    of capitalized software development costs for our credit default
    swap and
    DealerAxess

®

products. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we
    capitalized $3.4 million of software development costs and
    $1.5 million of computer and related equipment purchases.

Technology and Communications.

Technology and
    communications expense decreased by $0.2 million or 3.1% to
    $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from
    $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.
    This decrease was attributable to lower maintenance and office
    hardware costs.

Professional and Consulting Fees.

Professional
    and consulting fees decreased by $0.4 million or 5.4% to
    $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from
    $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.
    This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in audit and tax
    fees of $0.9 million and technology and non-technology
    consulting costs of $0.6 million, offset by higher
    recruiting fees of $0.7 million and legal costs of
    $0.6 million.

Occupancy.

Occupancy costs increased by
    $0.2 million or 8.0% to $3.3 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 from $3.0 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to rent expense for
    additional leased space in New York City.

Marketing and Advertising.

Marketing and
    advertising expense increased by $0.1 million or 7.7% to
    $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from
    $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.
    This increase was primarily due to higher promotion and public
    relations costs.

General and Administrative.

General and
    administrative expense increased by $0.6 million or 10.5%
    to $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    from $5.3 million for the year ended December 31,
    2006. This increase was primarily due to higher travel and
    entertainment expenses of $0.5 million and relocation
    expenses of $0.4 million, offset by reduced sales tax of
    $0.4 million and provision for bad debts of
    $0.2 million.



Provision
    for Income Tax

We recorded an income tax provision of $6.9 million and
    $3.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. The increase in the tax provision was
    primarily attributable to the $8.6 million increase in
    pre-tax income. With the exception of the payment of certain
    state and local taxes, the provision for income taxes was a
    non-cash expense since we had available net operating loss
    carryforwards and tax credits to offset the cash payment of
    taxes.

Our consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 was 40.2% compared to 37.0% for the year
    ended December 31, 2006. The 2007 provision includes an
    adjustment to the deferred tax asset balance of
    $0.5 million to reflect the tax rate anticipated to be in
    effect when the temporary differences are expected to reverse,
    as well as changes in enacted state and foreign tax rates. Due
    to our net deferred tax asset balance, a decrease in tax rates
    results in a reduction in our deferred tax balance and an
    increase in tax expense. Our consolidated effective tax rate can
    vary from period to period depending on, among other factors,
    the geographic and business mix of our earnings and changes in
    tax legislation and tax rates.

As of December 31, 2007, we had net operating loss and tax
    credit carryforwards for income tax purposes of
    $109.1 million. We have recorded a valuation allowance of
    $0.6 million against the gross deferred tax assets of
    $40.3 million arising from tax loss and credit
    carryforwards and temporary differences relating to the
    deductibility of certain expenses for book and tax purposes.
    This valuation allowance was deemed appropriate due to available
    evidence indicating that some of the deferred tax assets might
    not be realized in future years.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended
    December 31, 2005

Overview

Total revenues increased by $4.8 million or 6.1% to
    $83.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from $78.6 million for the year ended December 31,
    2005. This increase in total revenues was primarily due to
    increases in total commissions of $4.5 million, investment
    income of $1.4 million and information and user access fees
    of $1.0 million, offset in part by a decrease of
    $2.1 million in license fees.

Total expenses increased by $7.7 million or 11.5% to
    $74.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from $67.0 million for the year ended December 31,
    2005. This increase was primarily due to increases of
    $6.6 million in employee compensation and benefits,
    $1.1 million in general and administrative expense,
    $1.1 million in depreciation and amortization and
    $0.7 million in occupancy costs. These increases were
    offset by decreases in professional and consulting fees of
    $1.3 million and in marketing and advertising of
    $0.8 million. Excluding the impact of non-cash
    SFAS 123R stock option expense of $3.2 million, total
    expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased by
    $4.5 million or 6.7%, to $71.5 million from
    $67.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Income before taxes, which includes the incremental non-cash
    impact of SFAS 123R stock option expense, decreased by
    $3.0 million, or 25.6% to $8.6 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006, from $11.6 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2005. Net income decreased by
    $2.7 million or 33.4% to $5.4 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007, from $8.1 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2005.

U.S. high-grade volume increased by 10.0% for the year
    ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2005. The increase in U.S. high-grade
    volume was due primarily to an improvement in the Company’s
    estimated market share of total U.S. high-grade corporate
    bond volume as reported by FINRA TRACE from 7.6% for the year
    ended December 31, 2005 to 8.5% for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, offset by a decline in overall market
    volume as measured by FINRA TRACE. Estimated FINRA TRACE
    U.S. high-grade volume decreased by 1.8% from
    $2,337 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005 to
    $2,295 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006.
    The fixed monthly U.S. high-grade distribution fees were
    $29.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
    compared to $24.6 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2005. The
    DealerAxess

®

monthly minimum fees were $2.8 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. The total U.S. high-grade average
    fee per million is calculated for each period presented using
    both the variable transaction fees and the fixed monthly
    distribution fees, including the
    DealerAxess

®

monthly minimum fees, paid by our broker-dealer clients. The
    average U.S. high-grade fee per million decreased due to
    the introduction in June 2005 of our new fee plan, which has
    higher fixed monthly distribution fees and lower transaction
    fees, resulting in lower average fees per million at higher
    trading volumes, as well as the shorter maturity of trades
    executed on the platform. This was partially offset by the
    introduction of bond trading between broker-dealer clients
    through our
    DealerAxess

®

product in June 2006.

European high-grade volume increased by 19.4%, including the
    favorable effect of foreign currency changes, for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2005. The decrease in the average European
    high-grade fee per million from 2005 to 2006 resulted from
    higher trading volumes in floating-rate notes, which have lower
    fees per million.

Other volume increased by 17.5% for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily due to
    agencies volume. Other average fee per million declined
    primarily due to higher volume in products which carry lower
    fees per million.

Information and User Access Fees.

Information
    and user access fees increased by $1.0 million or 23.5% to
    $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from
    $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.
    This increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of
    subscribers to our Corporate
    BondTicker

TM

service from 2,942 for the year ended December 31, 2005 to
    4,629 for the year ended December 31, 2006.

License Fees.

License fees decreased by
    $2.1 million or 71.0% to $0.9 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 from $3.0 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2005. This decrease was attributable to
    a decline in the amortization of previously received license
    fees. We anticipate that license fees will be an insignificant
    source of revenues for us on a going-forward basis.

Investment Income.

Investment income increased
    by $1.4 million or 45.4% to $4.6 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 from $3.2 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2005. This increase was primarily due to
    higher cash and cash equivalents and securities
    available-for-sale balances and a rise in interest rates during
    the year ended December 31, 2006.

Other.

Other revenues decreased by
    $0.1 million or 10.5% to $0.9 million for the year

Employee Compensation and Benefits.

Employee
    compensation and benefits increased by $6.6 million or
    18.7% to $42.1 million for the year ended December 31,
    2006 from $35.4 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2005. This increase was primarily attributable
    to incremental stock option compensation costs of
    $3.2 million due to the adoption of SFAS 123R
    effective January 1, 2006, higher salary expense of
    $2.0 million, employee severance costs of $1.7 million
    and other stock compensation costs of $0.6 million, offset
    by a reduction in employee benefits and payroll taxes of
    $0.5 million and lower incentive compensation costs of
    $0.4 million. The total number of employees decreased to
    176 as of December 31, 2006 from 182 as of
    December 31, 2005. As a percentage of total revenues,
    employee compensation and benefits expense increased to 50.5%
    for the year ended December 31, 2006 from 45.1% for the
    year ended December 31, 2005.

Depreciation and Amortization.

Depreciation
    and amortization expense increased by $1.1 million or 19.1%
    to $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from $5.6 million for the year ended December 31,
    2005. This increase was attributable to increased amortization
    of capitalized software development costs for our credit default
    swap and
    DealerAxess

®

products. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we
    capitalized $4.1 million of software development costs and
    $2.7 million of computer and related equipment purchases.

Technology and Communications.

Technology and
    communications expense increased by $0.3 million or 4.1% to
    $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from
    $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.
    This increase was attributable to increased cost relating to the
    purchase of market data.

Professional and Consulting Fees.

Professional
    and consulting fees decreased by $1.3 million or 13.7% to
    $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from
    $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.
    This decrease was primarily due to $0.9 million in
    recruiting fees and $0.8 million in information technology
    consulting costs.

Occupancy.

Occupancy costs increased by
    $0.7 million or 28.2% to $3.0 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 from $2.4 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily due to
    rent expense for additional leased space in New York City and
    London.

Marketing and Advertising.

Marketing and
    advertising expense decreased by $0.8 million or 31.5% to
    $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from
    $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.
    This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in advertising
    expenditures of $0.7 million.



General and Administrative.

General and
    administrative expense increased by $1.1 million or 26.8%
    to $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from $4.2 million for the year ended December 31,
    2005. This increase was primarily due to increases in franchise
    and sales taxes of $0.7 million, provision for bad debts of
    $0.2 million and foreign currency transaction losses of
    $0.2 million.

Provision
    for Income Tax

For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we recorded
    an income tax provision of $3.2 million and
    $3.4 million, respectively. With the exception of the
    payment of certain state and local taxes, the provision for
    income taxes was a non-cash expense since we had available net
    operating loss carryforwards and tax credits to offset the cash
    payment of taxes.

Our consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 was 37.0%, compared to 29.6% for the year
    ended December 31, 2005. The 2005 tax provision included a
    $2.9 million reduction in our valuation allowance against
    the deferred tax asset. Our consolidated effective tax rate can
    vary from period to period depending on, among other factors,
    the geographic and business mix of our earnings and changes in
    tax legislation and tax rates.

Quarterly
    Results of Operations

Our quarterly results have varied significantly as a result of:

•

changes in trading volume due to market conditions, a decrease
    in the number of trading days in certain quarters, and
    seasonality effects caused by slow-downs in trading activity
    during certain periods;

•

increases in the number of broker-dealers and institutional
    investors using our trading platform as well as increased usage
    by existing clients;

•

expansion of the products we offer to our clients; and

•

variance in our expenses.



The following table sets forth certain consolidated quarterly
    income statement data for the eight quarters ended
    December 31, 2007. In our opinion, this unaudited
    information has been prepared on a basis consistent with our
    annual financial statements and includes all adjustments
    (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for
    a fair statement of the unaudited quarterly data. This
    information should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated
    Financial Statements and related Notes included in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

The results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily
    indicative of results that we may achieve for any subsequent
    periods.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

During the three years ended December 31, 2007, we have met
    our funding requirements through cash on hand and internally
    generated funds. Cash and cash equivalents and
    securities-available-for-sale totaled $118.1 million at
    December 31, 2005, $131.0 million at December 31,
    2006 and $124.3 million at December 31, 2007. We have
    no long-term or short-term debt and do not maintain bank lines
    of credit.

On October 26, 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a
    stock repurchase program for up to $40.0 million of our
    common stock. Shares repurchased under the program will be held
    in treasury for future use. During 2007, we repurchased
    2,452,214 shares at a purchase price of $34.6 million.
    A total of 2,642,214 shares have been repurchased at an
    aggregate cost of $37.2 million from the inception of the
    repurchase program through December 31, 2007.

Other
    Factors Influencing Liquidity and Capital
    Resources

We are dependent on our broker-dealer clients, seven of which
    are also our stockholders, who are not restricted from buying
    and selling fixed-income securities, directly or through their
    own proprietary or third-party platforms, with institutional
    investors. None of our broker-dealer clients is contractually or
    otherwise obligated to continue to use our electronic trading
    platform. The loss of, or a significant reduction in the use of
    our electronic platform by, our broker-dealer clients could
    reduce our cash flows, affect our liquidity and have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

We believe that our current resources are adequate to meet our
    liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at
    least the next 12 months. However, our future liquidity and
    capital requirements will depend on a number of factors,
    including expenses associated with product development and
    expansion and new business opportunities that are intended to
    further diversify our revenue stream. We may also acquire or
    invest in technologies, business ventures or products that are
    complementary to our business. In the event we require any
    additional financing, it will take the form of equity or debt
    financing. Any additional equity offerings may result in
    dilution to our stockholders. Any debt financings may involve
    restrictive covenants with respect to dividends, issuances of
    additional capital and other financial and operational matters
    related to our business.

As of December 31, 2007, we had $13.1 million invested
    in municipal auction rate securities. Liquidity for these
    securities is typically provided by an auction process that
    resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined intervals.
    Auctions for $11.0 million of these securities failed in
    February 2008 and, as a result, we were unable to liquidate
    these holdings. However, we believe that other cash, cash
    equivalents and securities balances are adequate to meet our
    liquidity requirements for expected growth and investment needs.
    All of the municipal auction rate securities that we hold are
    rated AAA by Standard & Poor’s and we do not
    believe that the value of these investments have been impaired.

We have two regulated subsidiaries, MarketAxess Corporation and
    MarketAxess Europe Limited. MarketAxess Corporation is a
    registered broker-dealer in the U.S. and MarketAxess Europe
    Limited is a registered multilateral trading facility in the
    U.K. As such, they are subject to minimum regulatory capital
    requirements imposed by their respective market regulators that
    are intended to ensure general financial soundness and liquidity
    based on certain minimum capital requirements. The U.S. and
    the U.K. regulations prohibit a registrant from repaying
    borrowings from its parent or affiliates, paying cash dividends,
    making loans to its parent or affiliates or otherwise entering
    into transactions that result in a significant reduction in its
    regulatory net capital position without prior notification to or
    approval from its principal regulator. The capital structures of
    our subsidiaries are designed to provide each with capital and
    liquidity consistent with its business and regulatory
    requirements. As of December 31, 2007, MarketAxess
    Corporation had net capital of $21.5 million, which was
    $20.3 million in excess of its required minimum net capital
    of $1.1 million. MarketAxess Europe Limited had financial
    resources, as defined by the FSA, of $17.1 million, which
    was $10.1 million in excess of its required financial
    resources of $7.0 million. We believe that MarketAxess
    Corporation and MarketAxess Europe Limited were required to
    maintain approximately $18.5 million and $8.0 million,
    respectively, in cash as of December 31, 2007 to support
    their minimum regulatory capital requirements.

In June 2006, our U.S. subsidiary, MarketAxess Corporation,
    commenced operating an anonymous matching service for its
    broker-dealer clients. MarketAxess Corporation executes bond
    trades on a riskless principal basis, which are cleared and
    settled by an independent clearing broker. The securities
    clearing agreement that MarketAxess Corporation maintains with
    the independent clearing broker commenced in December 2004.
    Under the securities clearing agreement, MarketAxess Corporation
    maintains a collateral deposit with the clearing broker in the
    form of cash or U.S. government securities. As of
    December 31, 2007, the collateral deposit included in
    securities and cash provided as collateral on the Consolidated
    Statements of Financial Condition was $0.5 million.
    MarketAxess Corporation is exposed to credit risk in the event a
    contra-party does not fulfill its obligation to complete a
    transaction. Pursuant to the terms of the securities clearing
    agreement between MarketAxess Corporation and the independent
    clearing broker, the clearing broker has the right to charge
    MarketAxess Corporation for losses resulting from a
    counterparty’s failure to fulfill its contractual
    obligations. The losses are not capped at a maximum amount and
    apply to all trades executed through the clearing broker. At
    December 31, 2007, MarketAxess Corporation had not recorded
    any liabilities with regard to this right. CDS transactions are
    conducted on the
    DealerAxess

®

platform on a name

give-up

basis and are directly settled between the two trading
    counterparties.



In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contracts that
    contain a variety of representations, warranties and general
    indemnifications. Our maximum exposure from any claims under
    these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve claims that
    have not yet occurred. However, based on past experience, we
    expect the risk of loss to be remote.

Effects
    of Inflation

Because the majority of our assets are liquid in nature, they
    are not significantly affected by inflation. However, the rate
    of inflation may affect our expenses, such as employee
    compensation, office leasing costs and communications expenses,
    which may not be readily recoverable in the prices of our
    services. To the extent inflation results in rising interest
    rates and has other adverse effects on the securities markets,
    it may adversely affect our financial position and results of
    operations.

Contractual
    Obligations and Commitments

As of December 31, 2007 we had the following contractual
    obligations and commitments:

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,
    “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments”
    (“SFAS 155”). SFAS 155 is an amendment of
    SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 140. SFAS 155
    permits companies to elect, on a

deal-by-deal

basis, to apply a fair value remeasurement for any hybrid
    financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that
    otherwise would require bifurcation. SFAS 155 is effective
    for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the
    beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins
    after September 15, 2006. Adoption of SFAS 155 did not
    affect our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156,
    “Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets”
    (“SFAS 156”). SFAS 156 amends
    SFAS No. 140. SFAS 156 requires that all
    separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities
    be initially measured at fair value. For subsequent
    measurements, SFAS 156 permits companies to choose between
    an amortization method or a fair value measurement method for
    reporting purposes. SFAS 156 is effective as of the
    beginning of a company’s first fiscal year that begins
    after September 15, 2006. Adoption of SFAS 156 did not
    affect our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”
    (“FIN 48”), which applies to all tax positions
    accounted for under SFAS 109. A “tax position”
    includes current or future reductions in taxable income reported
    or expected to be reported on a tax return. FIN 48
    supplements SFAS 109 by defining the confidence level that
    a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the
    financial statements. The interpretation requires that the tax
    effects of a position be recognized only if it is
    “more-likely-than-not” (greater than 50% likelihood)
    to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the
    reporting date. In making this assessment, a company must assume
    that the taxing authorities will examine the position. As a
    result of the implementation of FIN 48 effective
    January 1, 2007, we recognized an increase in deferred tax
    assets of $3.0 million related to previously unrecognized
    tax benefits, which was accounted for as an increase to
    Additional paid-in capital of $0.3 million and an increase
    in accrued expenses of $2.7 million.



In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”).
    SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about
    fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2007. We do not expect
    SFAS 157 to have a material impact on our Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities” (“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159
    permits companies to elect to measure eligible financial
    instruments, commitments and certain other arrangements at fair
    value at specified election dates, with changes in fair value
    recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting period.
    SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007. We do not expect SFAS 159 to have a
    material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised), “Business Combinations”
    (“SFAS 141R”). The standard changes the
    accounting for business combinations, including the measurement
    of acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business
    combination, the recognition of contingent consideration, the
    accounting for pre-acquisition gain and loss contingencies, the
    recognition of capitalized in-process research and development,
    the accounting for acquisition-related restructuring cost
    accruals, the treatment of acquisition-related transaction costs
    and the recognition of changes in the acquirer’s income tax
    valuation allowance. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2008. We are currently
    evaluating the impact of SFAS 141R on our Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an Amendment of ARB No. 51”
    (“SFAS 160”). SFAS 160 establishes
    accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling
    interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a
    subsidiary. This statement is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008. We do not expect
    SFAS 160 to have a material impact on our Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of the loss resulting from adverse
    changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and
    foreign currency exchange rates.

Market
    Risk

The global financial services business is, by its nature, risky
    and volatile and is directly affected by many national and
    international factors that are beyond our control. Any one of
    these factors may cause a substantial decline in the
    U.S. and global financial services markets, resulting in
    reduced trading volume. These events could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

As of December 31, 2007, we had a $51.6 million
    investment in securities available-for-sale. Adverse movements,
    such as a 10% decrease in the value of the securities underlying
    these positions or a downturn or disruption in the markets for
    these positions, could result in a substantial loss. In
    addition, principal gains and losses resulting from theses
    positions could on occasion have a disproportionate effect,
    positive or negative, on our financial condition and results of
    operations for any particular reporting period.

See Item 1A

. Risk Factors

, “Risks Related to
    Our Industry —

Economic, political and market
    factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services
    and harm our business, and our profitability could
    suffer

.”

Interest
    Rate Risk

Interest rate risk represents our exposure to interest rate
    changes with respect to the money market instruments,
    U.S. Treasury obligations and short-term fixed-income
    securities in which we invest. As of December 31, 2007, our
    cash and cash equivalents and securities available-for-sale
    amounted to $124.3 million and was primarily invested in
    money market instruments, federal agency issues and municipal
    securities. We do not maintain an inventory of bonds that are
    traded on our platform.



Derivative
    Risk

Our limited derivative risk stems from our activities in the
    foreign currency forward contract market. We use this market to
    mitigate our U.S. dollar versus Pound Sterling exposure
    that arises from the activities of our U.K. subsidiaries. As of
    December 31, 2007, the notional value of our foreign
    currency forward contracts was $21.8 million. We do not
    speculate in any derivative instruments.

Credit
    Risk

In June 2006, we began executing riskless principal transactions
    between our broker-dealer clients through our subsidiary,
    MarketAxess Corporation. We act as an intermediary in these
    transactions by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and
    the seller in matching back-to-back bond trades, which are then
    settled through a third-party clearing organization. Settlement
    typically occurs within one to three trading days after the
    trade date. Cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon
    receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded.

We are exposed to credit risk in our role as trading
    counterparty to our broker-dealer clients executing bond trades
    on the
    DealerAxess

®

platform. We are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe
    us money, securities or other assets will not perform their
    obligations. These parties may default on their obligations to
    us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or
    other reasons. Adverse movements in the prices of securities
    that are the subject of these transactions can increase our
    risk. Where the unmatched position or failure to deliver is

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of MarketAxess Holdings Inc. is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting as defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
    external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting includes those policies and
    procedures that:

(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
    reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
    transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
    recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the Company; and

(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
    timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
    of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect
    on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007. In making this assessment, management
    used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

.

Based on our assessment and those criteria, management concluded
    that the Company maintained effective internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2007.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007 has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.



Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

MarketAxess Holdings Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of MarketAxess Holdings Inc. and its
    subsidiaries at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results
    of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2007 in conformity
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained,
    in all material respects, effective internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying “Management’s Report on Internal Control
    over Financial Reporting.” Our responsibility is to express
    opinions on these financial statements and on the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our
    integrated audit. We conducted our audits in accordance with the
    standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
    whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
    statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for share-based compensation in 2006.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Significant
    Accounting Policies

Basis
    of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions
    and balances have been eliminated.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash maintained at
    U.S. and U.K. banks and in money market funds. The Company
    defines cash equivalents as short-term interest-bearing
    investments with maturities at the time of purchase of three
    months or less.

Securities
    and Cash Provided as Collateral

Securities provided as collateral consist of
    U.S. government obligations and cash. Collectively, these
    amounts are used as collateral for standby letters of credit, as
    collateral for foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the
    Company’s net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries
    and as collateral for a broker-dealer clearance account.

Securities
    Available-for-Sale

The Company classifies its marketable securities as
    available-for-sale securities. Unrealized marketable securities
    gains and losses are reflected as a net amount under the caption
    of accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated
    Statements of Financial Condition. Realized gains and losses are
    recorded within the Consolidated Statements of Operations in
    other revenues. For the purpose of computing realized gains and
    losses, cost is determined on a specific identification basis.

The Company assesses whether an other-than-temporary impairment
    loss on the investments has occurred due to declines in fair
    value or other market conditions. Declines in fair values that
    are considered other-than-temporary are recorded as charges in
    the Consolidated Statements of Operations. No charges for
    other-than-temporary declines were recorded during 2007, 2006
    and 2005.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

The Company continually monitors collections and payments from
    its clients and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts.
    The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the historical
    collection experience and specific collection issues that have
    been identified. Additions to the allowance for doubtful
    accounts are charged to bad debt expense, which is included in
    general and administrative expense in the Company’s
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The allowance for doubtful accounts was $0.9 million,
    $0.8 million and $0.4 million as of December 31,
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The provision for bad debts
    was $0.4 million, $0.7 million and $0.4 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Write-offs and other charges against the allowance
    for doubtful accounts were $0.3 million, $0.3 million
    and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31,
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Depreciation
    and Amortization

Fixed assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
    The Company uses the straight-line method of depreciation over
    three years. Leasehold improvements are stated at cost and are
    amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the
    life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease.

Software
    Development Costs

The Company capitalizes certain costs associated with the
    development of internal use software at the point at which the
    conceptual formulation, design and testing of possible software
    project alternatives have been completed. The Company
    capitalizes employee compensation and related benefits and third
    party consulting costs incurred during the preliminary software
    project stage. Once the product is ready for its intended use,
    such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over three
    years. The Company reviews the amounts capitalized for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable.

Foreign
    Currency Translation and Forward Contracts

Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
    translated using exchange rates at the end of the period;
    revenues and expenses are translated at average monthly rates.
    Gains and losses on foreign currency translation are a component
    of accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated
    Statements of Financial Condition. Transaction gains and losses
    are recorded in general and administrative expense in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to
    hedge its net investment in its U.K. subsidiaries. In accordance
    with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities,” gains and losses on
    these transactions are deferred and included in accumulated
    other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Statements of
    Financial Condition.

Revenue
    Recognition

The majority of the Company’s revenues are derived from
    monthly distribution fees and commissions for trades executed on
    its platform that are billed to its broker-dealer clients on a
    monthly basis. The Company also derives revenues from
    information and user access fees, license fees, investment
    income and other income. Other income includes revenues from
    technology services.

Commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the
    notional dollar volume of bonds traded on the platform and vary
    based on the type and maturity of the bond traded. Under the
    Company’s transaction fee plans,



MARKETAXESS
    HOLDINGS INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter
    maturities are generally charged lower commissions, while bonds
    that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities
    generally command higher commissions.

The Company enters into agreements with its broker-dealer
    clients pursuant to which the Company provides access to its
    platform through a non-exclusive and non-transferable license.
    Broker-dealer clients generally pay an initial license fee,
    which is typically due and payable upon execution of the
    broker-dealer agreement. The initial license fee varies by
    agreement and at a minimum is intended to cover the initial

set-up

costs
    incurred to enable a broker-dealer to begin using the
    Company’s electronic trading platform. Revenue is
    recognized in the first three months of the agreement in the
    estimated amount of the

set-up

costs
    incurred (50% in the first month, 40% in the second month and
    10% in the third month), and the remaining amount is deferred
    and recognized ratably over the initial term of the agreement,
    which is generally three years. The Company anticipates that
    license fees will be an insignificant source of revenues on a
    going-forward basis.

Revenues from contracts for technology integration consulting
    services are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method
    in accordance with Statement of Position

81-1,

“Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and
    Certain Production-Type Contracts.”
    Percentage-of-completion accounting involves calculating the
    percentage of services provided during the reporting period
    compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the
    duration of the contract. If estimates indicate that a contract
    loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in
    which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable.
    Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the
    estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the
    estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract.
    There were no contract loss provisions recorded as of
    December 31, 2007. Revenues recognized in excess of
    billings are recorded as unbilled services. Billings in excess
    of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenues until
    revenue recognition criteria are met.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all
    share-based payment awards in accordance with
    SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based
    Payment” (“SFAS 123R”). This statement
    requires that compensation expense for all share-based awards be
    recognized based on their estimated fair values measured as of
    the grant date. These costs are recognized as an expense in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations over the requisite service
    period, which is typically the vesting period, with an
    offsetting increase to additional paid-in capital. The Company
    adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective transition
    method, which required the application of the accounting
    standard as of January 1, 2006. In accordance with the
    modified prospective transition method, the Company’s
    Consolidated Financial Statements for prior periods have not
    been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of
    SFAS 123R.

Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for
    stock-based employee compensation plans in accordance with
    Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
    “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB
    25”), as permitted by SFAS No. 123,
    “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”
    (“SFAS 123”). In accordance with APB 25, the
    Company accounted for stock-based awards to employees and
    directors using the intrinsic value method. Had compensation
    expense for employee stock-based awards been determined based on
    the fair value at grant date consistent with SFAS 123R, for
    the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company would have
    reported net income of $6.8 million and basic and diluted
    EPS of $0.23 and $0.19, respectively. For purposes of computing
    the pro forma effect of adopting SFAS 123R, the Company
    used the Black-Scholes-Merton (“Black-Scholes”)
    option-pricing model to determine the per share weighted-average
    fair value for options granted.

The Company has used the long-method calculation, pursuant to
    SFAS 123R, to determine its additional

paid-in-capital

pool. As of December 31, 2007, the Company has calculated
    the additional

paid-in-capital

pool to be $3.5 million.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company presented
    all tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options as
    operating cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows. SFAS 123R requires the cash flows



MARKETAXESS
    HOLDINGS INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost
    recognized for those options (excess tax benefits) to be
    classified as financing cash flows.

Income
    Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability
    method in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
    “Accounting for Income Taxes”
    (“SFAS 109”). Deferred income taxes reflect the
    net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial
    reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are
    measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in
    effect when such differences are expected to reverse. The effect
    on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
    is recognized in income in the period that includes the
    enactment date. A valuation allowance is recognized against
    deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such
    assets will not be realized in future years.

Business
    Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible assets

Business acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase
    method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141,
    “Business Combinations.” The total cost of an
    acquisition is allocated to the underlying net assets based on
    their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the
    purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets
    acquired is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of
    certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in
    nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and
    assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash
    flows, discount rates, growth rates and asset lives.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets,” goodwill and other intangibles
    with indefinite lives are no longer amortized. An impairment
    review of goodwill is performed on an annual basis and more
    frequently if circumstances change. Intangible assets with
    definite lives, including purchased technology and other
    intangible assets, are amortized on a straight-line basis over
    their estimated useful lives of five years. Intangible assets
    are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances
    indicate a possible impairment pursuant to the provisions of
    SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for Long Lived Assets
    and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of.”

Earnings
    Per Share

Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by
    dividing the net income attributable to common stock by the
    weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
    for the period. Diluted EPS is computed using the same method as
    basic EPS, but in the denominator, shares of common stock
    outstanding reflect the potential dilution that could occur if
    convertible securities or other contracts to issue common stock
    were converted into or exercised for common stock.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
    management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
    contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
    statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
    during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
    those estimates.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,
    “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments”
    (“SFAS 155”). SFAS 155 is an amendment of
    SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 140. SFAS 155
    permits companies to elect, on a

deal-by-deal

basis, to apply a fair value remeasurement for any hybrid
    financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that
    otherwise would require bifurcation. SFAS 155 is effective
    for all financial instruments

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity’s first
    fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. Adoption
    of SFAS 155 did not affect the Company’s Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156,
    “Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets”
    (“SFAS 156”). SFAS 156 amends
    SFAS No. 140. SFAS 156 requires that all
    separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities
    be initially measured at fair value. For subsequent
    measurements, SFAS 156 permits companies to choose between
    an amortization method or a fair value measurement method for
    reporting purposes. SFAS 156 is effective as of the
    beginning of a company’s first fiscal year that begins
    after September 15, 2006. Adoption of SFAS 156 did not
    affect the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”
    (“FIN 48”), which applies to all tax positions
    accounted for under SFAS 109. A “tax position”
    includes current or future reductions in taxable income reported
    or expected to be reported on a tax return. FIN 48
    supplements SFAS 109 by defining the confidence level that
    a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the
    financial statements. The interpretation requires that the tax
    effects of a position be recognized only if it is
    “more-likely-than-not” (greater than 50% likelihood)
    to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the
    reporting date. In making this assessment, a company must assume
    that the taxing authorities will examine the position. As a
    result of the implementation of FIN 48 effective
    January 1, 2007, the Company recognized an increase in
    deferred tax assets of $3.0 million related to previously
    unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as an
    increase to Additional paid-in capital of $0.3 million and
    an increase in accrued expenses of $2.7 million. See
    Note 8, “Income Taxes.”

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”).
    SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about
    fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company does
    not expect SFAS 157 to have a material impact on its
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities” (“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159
    permits companies to elect to measure eligible financial
    instruments, commitments and certain other arrangements at fair
    value at specified election dates, with changes in fair value
    recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting period.
    SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007. The Company does not expect
    SFAS 159 to have a material impact on its Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised), “Business Combinations”
    (“SFAS 141R”). The standard changes the
    accounting for business combinations, including the measurement
    of acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business
    combination, the recognition of contingent consideration, the
    accounting for pre-acquisition gain and loss contingencies, the
    recognition of capitalized in-process research and development,
    the accounting for acquisition-related restructuring cost
    accruals, the treatment of acquisition-related transaction costs
    and the recognition of changes in the acquirer’s income tax
    valuation allowance. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company is
    currently evaluating the impact of SFAS 141R on its
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an Amendment of ARB No. 51”
    (“SFAS 160”). SFAS 160 establishes
    accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling
    interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a
    subsidiary. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company does not
    expect SFAS 160 to have a material impact on its
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior
    years’ financial statements in order to conform to the
    current year presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect
    on previously reported net income.

In 2000 and 2001, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. and MarketAxess
    Corporation had an ownership change within the meaning of
    Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Net operating
    loss carryforwards of $39.2 million existed as of the date
    of ownership change. However, only $6.8 million is deemed
    utilizable and recognized in the net operating loss carryforward
    figure. In the first quarter of 2007, the Company experienced an
    ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the
    Internal Revenue Code. The Company does not believe that this
    ownership change significantly impacts the ability to utilize
    existing net operating loss carryforwards. In addition, the
    Company’s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards
    may be subject to additional annual limitations if there is a
    50% or greater change in the Company’s ownership, as
    determined over a rolling three-year period.

During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the
    Company reduced the valuation allowance by $0.5 million and
    $2.9 million, respectively, based on management’s
    current assessment of the factors impacting the valuation
    allowance previously recorded. Such factors included
    management’s expectation of continuing future profitable
    operations and judgment concerning future utilization of certain
    net operating losses that are subject to Section 382
    limitations prior to their expiration. In accordance with
    FIN 48, certain deferred tax assets aggregating
    $14.1 million were no longer recognized and the related
    valuation allowance was reversed effective January 1, 2007.
    As of December 31, 2007, the valuation allowance relates to
    certain tax credit and charitable contribution carryforwards
    that are not expected to be realized. The rollforward of the

The Company or one of its subsidiaries files U.S. federal,
    state and foreign income tax returns. With the exception of New
    York and Connecticut state tax returns, all U.S. federal,
    state and U.K. income tax returns have not been subject to
    audit. The Company’s New York State franchise tax returns
    for 2000 through 2003 are currently under examination. The
    Company cannot estimate when the examination will conclude.
    During 2007, an examination of the New York City tax returns for
    2001 to 2003 concluded with no adjustments. In addition, an
    examination of the Company’s Connecticut income tax returns
    for 2003 and 2004 concluded in 2007 resulting in a payment of
    taxes and interest aggregating $0.1 million.

As a result of the implementation of FIN 48 effective
    January 1, 2007, the Company recognized an increase in
    deferred tax assets of $3.0 million related to previously
    unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as an
    increase to additional paid-in capital of $0.3 million and
    an increase in accrued expenses of $2.7 million. If
    recognized, this entire amount would impact the effective tax
    rate. A reconciliation of the unrecognized tax benefits is as

    limitation on conversion to the extent such conversion would
    result in a stockholder, together with its affiliates, owning
    more than 9.99% of the outstanding shares of common stock.
    During 2007 and 2006, a total of 539,725 shares and
    1,275,951 shares, respectively, of non-voting common stock
    were converted to voting common stock.

In October 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company
    authorized a share repurchase program for up to
    $40.0 million of the Company’s common stock. Shares
    repurchased under the program will be held in treasury for
    future use. During 2007 and 2006, a total of
    2,452,214 shares and 190,500 shares were repurchased
    at a cost of $34.6 million and $2.7 million,
    respectively. A total of 2,642,714 shares have been
    repurchased at an aggregate cost of $37.2 million from the
    inception of the repurchase program through December 31,
    2007. The share repurchase program was completed in January 2008.

Common
    Stock Subscribed

In 2001, the Company awarded 289,581 shares to the
    Company’s Chief Executive Officer at $3.60 per share, which
    vested over a three-year period. The common stock subscribed was
    issued in 2001 in exchange for four eleven-year promissory notes
    that bear interest at the applicable federal rate and are
    collateralized by the subscribed shares.

Warrants

In April 2000, the Board of Directors initiated a warrant
    program that commenced on February 1, 2001. Under this
    program, the Company reserved for issuance 5,000,002 shares
    of common stock. The warrants were issued to holders of
    Series A, C, E and I redeemable convertible preferred stock
    (the “Warrant Holders”). The Warrant Holders were
    entitled to purchase shares of common stock from the Company at
    an exercise price of $.003. There are no warrants outstanding as
    of December 31, 2007.

The warrants were issued to the Warrant Holders at the time that
    they made an equity investment in the Company. Allocations were
    based on each broker-dealer client’s respective commissions
    as a percentage of the total commissions from the six
    participating Warrant Holders, calculated on a quarterly basis.
    The final share allocations under the warrant program occurred
    on March 1, 2004. Shares allocated under the warrant
    program were expensed on a quarterly basis at fair market value
    in accordance with SFAS 123.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, two Stockholder
    Broker-Dealer Clients converted 1,325,602 warrants into
    1,325,249 shares of common stock through non-cash
    exercises. During the year ended December 31, 2006, two
    Stockholder Broker-Dealer Clients converted 1,295,004 warrants
    into 1,294,849 shares of common stock through non-cash
    exercises. During the year ended December 31, 2007, two
    Stockholder Broker-Dealer Clients converted 2,379,200 warrants
    into 2,378,764 shares of common stock through non-cash
    exercises. The exercise of warrants during 2007 and prior years
    resulted in an unrecognized deferred tax asset of
    $18.3 million that will be recorded as an increase to
    additional

paid-in-capital

once the tax benefit serves to reduce taxes payable in future
    years.

In March 2001, in connection with the acquisition of Trading
    Edge, Inc. (“Trading Edge”), the Company also assumed
    warrants issued by Trading Edge, which were converted into
    warrants exercisable to purchase 7,967 shares of the
    Company’s common stock. During the year ended
    December 31, 2005, these warrants expired unexercised.

The Company has three stock incentive plans which provide for
    the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights,
    restricted stock, performance shares, performance units, or
    other stock-based awards as incentives and rewards to encourage
    employees, consultants and non-employee directors to participate
    in the long-term success of the Company. On June 7, 2006,
    stockholder approval was obtained for an amendment and
    restatement of the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan to, among other
    things, increase the number of shares authorized for issuance
    under the plan from 3,084,802 to 9,754,802 shares. As of
    December 31, 2007, there were 6,141,765 shares

Stock
    Options

The exercise price of each option granted is equal to the market
    price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.
    Generally, option grants have provided for vesting over a
    three-year period, with one-third vesting after one year from
    the grant date and the remaining two-thirds vesting on an equal
    monthly basis over the remaining two-year period. Options expire
    ten years from the date of grant.



MARKETAXESS
    HOLDINGS INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes closed-form model. The Company
    believes that the use of the Black-Scholes model meets the fair
    value measurement objectives of SFAS 123R and reflects all
    substantive characteristics of the instruments being valued. The
    determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the
    date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by the
    Company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a
    number of highly complex and subjective variables, including the
    expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, the
    risk-free interest rate and the expected term. Expected
    volatilities are based on historical volatility of the
    Company’s stock and a peer group. The risk-free interest
    rate is based on U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity
    value approximating the expected term of the option. The
    expected term represents the period of time that options granted
    are expected to be outstanding based on actual and projected
    employee stock option exercise behavior and was increased from
    four years to five years in May 2006.

The following table represents the assumptions used for the
    Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the per share
    weighted-average fair value for options granted for the years

Restricted
    Stock

Shares of restricted stock generally vest over a period of three
    years. Certain grants vest after five years, but contain
    provisions that allow for accelerated vesting over a shorter
    term if defined performance criteria are met. Compensation
    expense is measured at the grant date and recognized ratably
    over the vesting period. The Company considers the likelihood of
    meeting the performance criteria in determining the amount to
    expense on a periodic basis.

    expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Rental
    expense has been recorded based on the total minimum lease

    $3.3 million.

In June 2006, MarketAxess Corporation commenced operating an
    anonymous matching service for its broker-dealer clients.
    MarketAxess Corporation executes bond trades on a riskless
    principal basis, which are cleared and settled by an independent
    clearing broker. The securities clearing agreement that
    MarketAxess Corporation maintains with the independent clearing
    broker commenced in December 2004. Under the securities clearing
    agreement, MarketAxess Corporation maintains a collateral
    deposit with the clearing broker in the form of cash or
    U.S. government securities. As of December 31, 2007
    and 2006, the collateral deposit included in securities and cash
    provided as collateral on the Consolidated Statements of
    Financial Condition was $0.5 million. MarketAxess
    Corporation is exposed to credit risk in the event a
    contra-party does not fulfill its obligation to complete a
    transaction. Pursuant to the terms of the securities clearing
    agreement between MarketAxess Corporation and the independent
    clearing broker, the clearing broker has the right to charge
    MarketAxess Corporation for losses resulting from a
    counterparty’s failure to fulfill its contractual
    obligations. The losses are not capped at a maximum amount and
    apply to all trades executed through the clearing broker. At
    December 31, 2007, MarketAxess Corporation had not recorded
    any liabilities with regard to this right.

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into
    contracts that contain a variety of representations, warranties
    and general indemnifications. The Company’s maximum
    exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would
    involve future claims that may be made against the Company that
    have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the Company
    expects the risk of loss to be remote.

In January 2007, two former employees commenced arbitration
    proceedings against MarketAxess Corporation before FINRA arising
    out of the expiration of certain vested and unvested stock
    options and unvested restricted shares issued to them. In April
    2007, one of those former employees brought a separate FINRA
    arbitration against MarketAxess Holdings Inc. based on the same
    claim he had filed against MarketAxess Corporation. The
    arbitrations brought by that employee against both MarketAxess
    Corporation and MarketAxess Holdings Inc. have been consolidated
    before FINRA. The claims made by these two former employees
    total $4.5 million plus interest.

One former employee has alleged that the Company wrongfully
    prevented him from exercising his vested options when he sought
    to do so and that the Company wrongfully claimed that such
    options had expired on the previous day.

The other former employee has alleged that the Company
    wrongfully failed to accelerate the vesting of his then unvested
    options and restricted shares upon his termination and to waive
    the

90-day

time period within which he was required to exercise his vested
    options. He further alleges that he is entitled to a bonus for
    the approximately five months that he worked for us during 2006.

MarketAxess Corporation answered both arbitration claims brought
    against it. The Company has vigorously defended the claims
    brought against both MarketAxess Corporation and MarketAxess
    Holdings Inc. Based on currently available information,
    management believes that the likelihood of a material loss is
    not probable. Accordingly, no amounts have been provided in the
    accompanying financial statements. However, arbitration is
    subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could
    occur.

Acquisition

In November 2007, the Company acquired certain assets and
    assumed certain obligations of TWS, a Utah-based financial
    software and technology services provider focused on providing
    gateway adapters for connecting order management systems and
    trading systems to fixed-income trading venues, for
    $3.0 million in cash and 64,642 shares of the
    Company’s common stock. The shares of common stock issued
    in connection with the TWS acquisition have been characterized
    as compensation expense and, accordingly, are not included in
    the purchase price. Stock compensation expense totaling
    $1.0 million will be recognized over the vesting period.
    One-half of these shares vest on January 1, 2009 and the
    balance vest on January 1, 2010. The acquisition of TWS did
    not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated
    Financial Statements. The Company has completed a preliminary
    allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. It
    is possible that the purchase price allocation will be adjusted
    upon finalization of the accounting for the acquired assets. The
    preliminary purchase price allocation is as follows (in
    thousands):

Segment
    Information

As an electronic multi-dealer platform for the trading of
    fixed-income securities, the Company’s operations
    constitute a single business segment pursuant to
    SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an
    Enterprise and Related Information.” Because of the highly
    integrated nature of the financial markets in which the Company
    competes and the integration of the Company’s worldwide
    business activities, the Company believes that results by
    geographic region or client sector are not necessarily
    meaningful in understanding its business.

Accounting
    for Foreign Currency Forward Contracts and Hedging
    Activities

The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts with
    a non-controlling stockholder to hedge its exposure to
    variability in foreign currency cash flows resulting from the
    net investments in its U.K. subsidiaries. The Company assesses
    each foreign currency forward contract to ensure that it is
    highly effective at reducing the exposure being hedged. The
    Company designates each foreign currency forward contract as a
    hedge, assesses the risk management objective and strategy,
    including identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged
    item and the risk exposure and how effectiveness is to be
    assessed prospectively and retrospectively. These hedges are for
    a one-month or three-month period and are used to limit exposure
    to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Gains or losses
    on foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges are
    included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the
    Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.

A summary of the foreign currency forward contracts is as
    follows:
