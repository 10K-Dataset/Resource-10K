PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Our Company

American Water Works Company, Inc., a Delaware Corporation, is the most geographically diversified as well as the largest, as measured both by operating
revenue and population served, investor-owned United States water and wastewater utility company. Our approximately 7,300 employees provide approximately 15 million people with drinking water, wastewater and other water-related services in 32
states and Ontario, Canada.

In 2008, we generated $2,336.9 million in total operating revenue and $186.9 million in operating loss,
which includes $750.0 million of impairment charges relating to continuing operations, and a net loss of $562.4 million. In 2007, we generated $2,214.2 million in total operating revenue, representing approximately four times the operating revenue
of the next largest investor-owned company in the United States water and wastewater business, and $15.1 million in operating income which includes $509.3 million of impairment charges relating to continuing operations.

We have two operating segments which are also the Company’s two reportable segments, which we refer to as the Regulated Businesses and Non-Regulated
Businesses segments. For further details on our segments, see Note 22 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

For 2008, our Regulated
Businesses generated $2,082.7 million in operating revenue, which accounted for 89.1% of total operating revenue. For the same period, our Non-Regulated Businesses generated $272.2 million, in operating revenue, which accounted for 11.6% of total
consolidated operating revenue.

For additional financial information, please see the financial statements and related notes thereto
appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Our History as a Public Company

The Company was founded in 1886 as the American Water Works & Guarantee Company, for the purposes of building and purchasing water systems in
McKeesport, Pennsylvania. In 1935, the Company was reorganized under its current name, and in 1947 the common stock of the Company became publicly traded on the NYSE. Prior to being acquired by RWE Aktiengesellschaft, which we refer to as RWE, a
stock corporation incorporated in the Federal Republic of Germany, in 2003, we were the largest publicly traded water utility company as measured both by operating revenue and population served in the United States.

Our Acquisition by RWE

In 2003, we were
acquired by RWE and were no longer a publicly traded company. The RWE acquisition resulted in certain changes in our business. For example, our operations and management were managed through Thames Water Plc, a former subsidiary of RWE, which we
refer to as Thames Water. Also, we agreed not to file rate cases with certain state commissions or other entities engaged in economic regulation of our subsidiaries, which we refer to as PUCs, for specified periods of time as a condition of the
acquisition. All rate stay-out provisions associated with the RWE acquisition have expired. On September 28, 2007, Thames Water Aqua US Holdings, Inc., which we refer to as Thames US Holdings, at the time an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
RWE, was merged with and into American Water with American Water being the surviving entity, which we refer to as the Merger. In 2005, RWE decided to divest American Water and in March 2006, decided to effect the divestiture through the sale of
shares in one or more public offerings.

Our Initial Public Offering

Upon the completion of our initial public offering in April 2008, we again became listed on the NYSE under the symbol “AWK” and resumed our
position as the largest publicly traded water utility company in the United States.



Regulated Businesses Overview

Our primary business involves the ownership of water and wastewater utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential, commercial and
industrial customers. Our subsidiaries that provide these services are generally subject to economic regulation by the state PUCs in the states in which they operate. The federal government and the states also regulate environmental, health and
safety and water quality matters. We report the results of this business in our Regulated Businesses segment.

The following charts set
forth operating revenue for 2008 and customers as of December 31, 2008, respectively for the states in which our Regulated Businesses provide services:

Regulated Businesses Customers

Non-Regulated Businesses Overview

We also provide services that are not subject to economic regulation by state PUCs through our Non-Regulated Businesses. Our Non-Regulated Businesses include:

•

our Contract Operations Group, which enters into public/private partnerships, including Operations and Maintenance, which we refer to as O&M, and Design, Build
and Operate, which we refer to as DBO contracts for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for municipalities, the United States military and other customers;

•

our Applied Water Management Group, which works with customers to design, build and operate small water and wastewater treatment plants;

•

our Homeowner Services Group, which provides services to domestic homeowners to protect against the cost of repairing broken or leaking pipes inside and outside
their homes; and

•

Terratec Environmental Ltd., which we refer to as Terratec, which primarily provides wastewater, residuals, transport, disposal and management services to municipal
and industrial customers in Ontario, Canada.

We report the results of these lines of business in our Non-Regulated
Businesses segment. For 2008, operating revenue for our Non-Regulated Businesses was $272.2 million prior to inter-segment eliminations,



accounting for 11.6% of total operating revenue for the same period. Non-Regulated Business operating revenues were $242.7 million for 2007 and $248.5
million for 2006 accounting for 11.0% and 11.9% respectively, of total operating revenues for the same periods.

Our Industry

Overview

The United States water and
wastewater industry has two main segments: (i) utility, which involves supplying water and wastewater services to consumers, and (ii) general services, which involves providing water- and wastewater-related services to water and wastewater
utilities and other customers on a contract basis.

The utility segment includes municipal systems, which are owned and operated by local
governments or governmental subdivisions, and investor-owned systems. The Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) estimates that government-owned systems make up the vast majority of the United States water and wastewater utility segment,
accounting for approximately 84% of all United States community water systems and approximately 98% of all United States community wastewater systems. Investor-owned water and wastewater systems account for the remainder of the United States water
and wastewater community water systems. Growth of service providers in the utility segment is achieved through acquisitions, including small water and wastewater systems, typically serving fewer than 10,000 customers, in close geographic proximity
to where we currently operate our Regulated Business, which we refer to as “tuck-ins,” of other water and wastewater systems and organic growth of the population served by such providers.

The utility segment is characterized by high barriers to entry, including high capital spending requirements. Investor-owned water and wastewater
utilities also face regulatory approval processes in order to do business, which may involve obtaining relevant operating approvals, including certificates of public convenience and necessity (or similar authorizations) from state PUCs.
Investor-owned water and wastewater systems are generally economically regulated by the state PUCs in the states in which they operate. The federal government and the states also regulate environmental, health and safety and water quality matters
for both investor-owned and government-owned water and wastewater utilities.

The general services segment includes engineering and
consulting companies and numerous other fee-for-service businesses. These include the building and operating of water and wastewater utility systems, system repair services, lab services, sale of water infrastructure and distribution products (such
as pipes) and other specialized services. The general services segment is characterized by aggressive competition and market-driven growth and profit margins.

The aging water and wastewater infrastructure in the United States is in constant need of modernization and facilities replacement. Increased regulations to improve water quality and the management of wastewater
discharges, which began with passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972 and the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1974, have been among the primary drivers of the need for modernization. The EPA estimates that approximately $277 billion of capital
spending will be necessary between 2003 and 2022 to replace aging infrastructure and to comply with quality standards to ensure quality water systems across the United States. In addition, the EPA estimates that approximately $388 billion of capital
spending will be necessary between 2000 and 2019 to replace aging infrastructure and ensure quality wastewater systems across the United States.



The following chart sets forth estimated capital expenditure needs from 2003 through 2022 for United
States water systems:

Capital expenditures related to municipal water supply, treatment and distribution and wastewater collection
and treatment facilities are typically funded by water and wastewater rates, taxes or the issuance of bonds. However, raising large amounts of funds is challenging for municipal water utilities, which impacts their ability to increase capital
spending. In order to meet their capital spending challenges, many municipalities are examining a combination of privatizations and partnerships with the private sector. Privatization involves a transfer of responsibility for, and ownership of, the
utility from the municipality to the private sector. Partnerships between municipalities and the private sector include DBO contracts, own, operate and transfer contracts and own, leaseback and operate contracts. Under these types of contracts, the
municipality maintains ownership of the water and/or wastewater system and the private sector takes responsibility for managing and operating the system.

Over the next five years, we estimate that Company-funded capital investment will total between $4.0 and $4.5 billion. Our capital investment includes both infrastructure renewal programs, where we replace existing
infrastructure, as needed, and construction of facilities to meet new customer growth. Over the next five years, we estimate we will invest approximately $1.3 to $1.4 billion to replace aging infrastructure including mains, meters, and supply and
treatment facilities. We estimate that we will invest approximately $1.2 to $1.3 billion in facilities to serve new customer growth over the same period. In addition, we estimate that complying with water quality standards and other regulatory
requirements will require approximately $300 to $400 million of investment. We estimate that projects to enhance system reliability, quality of service, and risk reduction will require an investment of approximately $800 million, while efficiency
related projects will require an investment of $400 to $600 million.



The charts below set forth our estimated percentage of projected capital expenditures for 2009 to 2013 by
purpose of investment and by asset type respectively:

Fragmentation and Consolidation

The utility segment of the United States water and wastewater industry is highly fragmented, with approximately 52,000 community water systems and approximately 16,000 community wastewater facilities, according to the
EPA. As shown in the charts below, the majority of the approximately 52,000 community water systems are very small, serving a population of 500 or less.

The following charts set forth the total United States water industry by system type and the total population served by system type, respectively, for 2008: (Water Statistics)

Number of United States Water Systems by Type:*

United States Population Served by Water System Type:*

This large number of relatively small water and wastewater utilities results in inefficiencies in the
marketplace, since smaller utilities may not have the operating expertise, financial and technological capability or economies of scale to provide services or raise capital as efficiently as larger utilities. These inefficiencies may



lead to industry consolidation in the future, as the larger investor-owned utilities acquire smaller, local water and wastewater systems. Larger utilities
that have greater access to capital are generally more capable of making mandated and other necessary infrastructure upgrades to both water and wastewater systems. In addition, water and wastewater utilities with large customer bases spread across
broad geographic regions may more easily absorb the impact of adverse weather, such as droughts, excessive rain and cool temperatures in specific areas. Larger utilities are able to spread overhead expenses over a larger customer base, thereby
reducing the costs to serve each customer. Since many administrative and support activities can be efficiently centralized to gain economies of scale and sharing of best practices, companies that participate in industry consolidation have the
potential to improve operating efficiencies, lower unit costs and improve service at the same time.

Water and Wastewater Rates

Investor-owned water and wastewater utilities generate operating revenue from customers based on rates that are established by state PUCs through a
rate-setting process that may include public hearings, evidentiary hearings and the submission by the utility of evidence and testimony in support of the requested level of rates. In evaluating a rate case, state PUCs typically focus on five areas:
(i) the amount and prudence of investment in facilities considered “used and useful” in providing public service; (ii) the operating and maintenance costs and taxes associated with providing the service (typically by making
reference to a representative 12-month period of time, known as a test year); (iii) the appropriate rate of return; (iv) the tariff or rate design that allocates operating revenue requirements equitably across the customer base; and
(v) the quality of service the utility provides, including issues raised by customers.

For most consumers, water and wastewater bills
make up a relatively small percentage of household expenditures compared to other utility services.

The following chart sets forth the
relative cost of water in the United States as a percentage of total household utility expenditures:

Our Regulated Businesses

Our core Regulated Businesses, which consist of locally managed utility subsidiaries that generally are economically regulated by the states in which they operate, accounted for approximately 89.1% of our consolidated operating revenue in
2008. Our Regulated Businesses provide a high degree of financial stability because (i) high barriers to entry provide limited protection from competitive pressures, (ii) economic regulation promotes predictability in financial planning
and long-term performance through the rate-setting process and (iii) our largely residential customer base promotes consistent operating results.



Overview of Networks, Facilities and Water Supply

Our Regulated Businesses operate in approximately 1,600 communities in 20 states in the United States. Our primary operating assets include approximately
80 surface water treatment plants, 600 groundwater treatment plants, 1,100 groundwater wells, 50 wastewater treatment facilities, 1,100 treated water storage facilities, 1,200 pumping stations and 100 dams and 48,000 miles of mains and collection
pipes. We own substantially all of the assets used by our Regulated Businesses.

We generally own the land and physical assets used to
store, extract and treat source water. Typically, we do not own the water itself, which is held in public trust and is allocated to us through contracts and allocation rights granted by federal and state agencies or through the ownership of water
rights pursuant to local law. Sources of supply are seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply. In connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources, we employ sophisticated models to
determine safe yields under different rainfall and drought conditions. Surface and groundwater levels are routinely monitored for all supplies so that supply capacity may be predicted and, as needed, mitigated through demand management and
additional supply development.

The following chart sets forth the sources of water supply for our Regulated Businesses for 2008 by volume:

The level of water treatment that we apply varies significantly depending upon the quality of the water source.
Surface water sources, such as rivers, typically require significant filtration, while some groundwater sources, such as aquifers, require chemical treatment only. In addition, a small amount of treated water is purchased from neighboring water
purveyors. Treated water is transported through an extensive transmission and distribution network, which includes underground pipes, above ground storage facilities and numerous pumping facilities with the ultimate distribution of the treated water
to the customers’ premises. We also have installed meters to measure the water that we deliver through our distribution network. We employ a variety of methods of meter reading to monitor consumption, ranging from basic mechanical meters read
by traveling meter readers to remote “drive-by” electronic meter reading equipment. The majority of new meters are able to support future advances in electronic meter reading.

The provision of wastewater services involves the collection of wastewater from customers’ premises through sewer lines. The wastewater is then
transported through a sewer network to a treatment facility where it is treated to meet required effluent standards. The treated wastewater is finally returned to the environment as effluent, and the solid waste byproduct of the treatment process is
disposed of in accordance with local standards.

Maintaining the reliability of our networks is a key activity of our Regulated Businesses.
We have ongoing main renewal programs in all states in which our Regulated Businesses operate. These programs consist of both



rehabilitation of existing mains and replacement of mains that have reached the end of their useful service life. The decision of whether to replace or
rehabilitate our mains is subject to considerations of cost, feasibility and customer service impact.

The following table sets forth
operating revenue for 2008 and number of customers as of December 31, 2008 for our regulated subsidiaries in the states where our Regulated Businesses provide services:

†

Includes data from our operating subsidiaries in the following states: Arizona, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas and
Virginia.

Approximately 83.3% of operating revenue from our Regulated Businesses in 2008 was generated from approximately
2.7 million customers in our seven largest states, as measured by operating revenues. In fiscal year 2008, no single customer accounted for more than 1% of our annual operating revenue.

The operational characteristics of our Regulated Businesses, including water and wastewater networks and infrastructure and water sources and supply,
vary on a state-by-state basis, as explained below with respect to our top seven states by Regulated Businesses revenues.

New Jersey

New Jersey-American Water Company, Inc., which we refer to as NJAWC, serves a population of approximately 2.5 million. NJAWC combined with our
Applied Wastewater Management Inc., which we refer to as AWWM, (also regulated in New Jersey) generated approximately $517.7 million of operating revenue in 2008, representing approximately 24.9% of operating revenue of our Regulated Businesses
for that period.

In New Jersey, our infrastructure and assets are designed to collect, treat and distribute water from a variety of
surface water sources (including streams, lakes and reservoirs) and groundwater sources. In 2008, we obtained 65% of our water supply from surface water sources and 30% from groundwater sources. Purchased water accounted for 5% of water supply,
respectively, for the same period.

NJAWC currently operates seven surface water treatment plants and approximately 150 groundwater
treatment plants, which process water extracted from more than 170 groundwater wells. We maintain approximately 150 treated water storage facilities, 140 pumping stations and seven dams, and our water and wastewater collection and distribution
systems comprise approximately 8,900 miles of mains and collection pipes. Both AWWM and NJAWC currently provide wastewater treatment services to small communities in New Jersey.

In New Jersey, in order to ensure that we have adequate sources of water supply, we utilize reservoirs, aquifer storage supplies and seasonal wells to
provide for water needs during peak summer seasons. Through the



optimization of ground and surface water rights, we are able to balance seasonal fluctuations and provide sufficient water supply to our customers year
round. We also maintain drought and emergency plans to minimize the impact on service through a wide range of weather fluctuations.

During
2007, NJAWC entered into an agreement with the City of Trenton, New Jersey to purchase the assets of the City’s water system located in four surrounding communities. The agreement required approval from the New Jersey PUC. The initial proposed
purchase price of $100.0 million was subsequently amended to $75.0 million; in addition, the agreement has been amended to include the provision of technical services from the City over seven years to ensure a smooth transition of ownership at a
total cost of $5.0 million. The administrative law judge hearing the matter has issued an initial decision (the “Initial Decision”) approving a stipulation of settlement reflecting the changed agreement (the “Stipulation”) and
sent the Initial Decision to the New Jersey PUC for consideration. On February 25, 2009, a petition seeking a referendum was filed with the City of Trenton. The petition seeks to force the City Council to reconsider its prior approval of sale, and a
vote as to whether the Ordinance approving the sale of the system should go forward or be negated. The Company can provide no assurance as to the outcome of the referendum nor can we provide assurance that the Initial Decision will ultimately be
approved by the New Jersey PUC. Included in the Stipulation, and dependent upon final approval, the Company intends to purchase finished water from the City of Trenton for the next 20 years under a water supply agreement. The acquisition is expected
to add approximately 40,000 customers to the Company’s customer base.

Pennsylvania

Pennsylvania-American Water Company, which we refer to as PAWC, serves a population of approximately 2 million and generated approximately
$447.9 million of operating revenue in 2008, representing approximately 21.5% of operating revenue of our Regulated Businesses for that period.

In Pennsylvania, our infrastructure and assets are designed to collect, treat and distribute water from a variety of surface water sources (including streams, lakes and reservoirs) and groundwater sources. In 2008, we
obtained 92% of our water supply from surface water sources and 7% from groundwater sources. Purchased water accounted for 1% of our water supply for the same period.

PAWC currently operates approximately 35 surface water treatment plants and 70 groundwater treatment plants, which process water extracted from over 100 groundwater wells. We maintain approximately 250 treated water
storage facilities, 280 pumping stations and 60 dams, and our water and wastewater collection and distribution systems comprise approximately 9,900 miles of mains and collection pipes. We currently operate seven wastewater treatment facilities in
Pennsylvania.

In Pennsylvania, in order to ensure that we have adequate sources of water supply, we maintain active drought contingency
plans in each of our public water systems. The plans identify the source of supply operations that are used during normal and drought weather conditions and specify measures to be taken at different drought trigger levels to increase supply and/or
curtail water demand. Water allocation and passing-flow requirements must be managed to maintain adequate supply to our production facilities. In addition, we have taken action to augment supply in systems that have historically had drought-related
supply issues (such as Butler, Pennsylvania) by finding alternative raw water sources and making finished water interconnections with other systems.

Illinois

Illinois-American Water Company, which we refer to as ILAWC, serves a population of approximately 1 million.
ILAWC and American Lake Water Company, also a regulated subsidiary in Illinois, generated approximately $187.5 million of operating revenue in 2008, representing approximately 9.0% of operating revenue of our Regulated Businesses for that period.

In Illinois, our infrastructure and assets are designed to collect, treat and distribute water from a variety of surface water sources
(including rivers, streams, lakes and reservoirs) and groundwater sources. In 2008, we



obtained 49% of our water supply from surface water sources and 39% from groundwater sources. Purchased treated water accounted for 12% of water supply for
the same period.

ILAWC currently operates approximately five surface water treatment plants and 30 groundwater treatment plants, which
process water extracted from more than 60 groundwater wells. We maintain three dams and over 60 treated water storage facilities, 100 pumping stations and our water and wastewater collection and distribution systems comprise nearly 4,400 miles of
mains and collection pipes. We currently operate 11 wastewater treatment facilities in Illinois.

In Illinois, we utilize a comprehensive
planning process to assess source of supply adequacy. This assessment addresses both water quantity and quality features. Future customer demand projections are prepared. Existing system delivery infrastructure is evaluated to determine the
capabilities of addressing anticipated demands. In addition to determining source of supply quantity adequacy, the ability to deliver the appropriate water quality is assessed. This would include compliance with environmental regulations as well as
company water quality goals. The planning efforts result in a list of improvements that include source of supply upgrades.

Missouri

Missouri-American Water Company, which we refer to as MOAWC, serves a population of over 1 million and generated approximately $181.1 million of
operating revenue in 2008, representing approximately 8.7% of operating revenue of our Regulated Businesses for that period.

In Missouri,
our infrastructure and assets are designed to collect, treat and distribute water from a variety of surface water sources (including rivers, streams, lakes and reservoirs) and groundwater sources. In 2008, we obtained 83% of our water supply from
surface water sources and 17% from groundwater sources.

MOAWC currently operates six surface water treatment plants and approximately 15
groundwater treatment plants, which process water extracted from over 35 groundwater wells. We maintain one dam, approximately 70 treated water storage facilities, 40 pumping stations and our water and wastewater collection and distribution systems
comprise nearly 5,700 miles of mains and collection pipes. We currently operate four wastewater treatment facilities in Missouri.

Our
ability to ensure adequate supply of water in Missouri is enhanced by our comprehensive planning process. In that process, we project future water demands based on historical growth patterns. Source of supply improvement projects are planned well in
advance of actual need. Our operating districts in Missouri enjoy abundant water resources with limitation only in our Joplin service area where the source of water supply is unable to meet peak demands under drought conditions. To manage this issue
on the demand side, the water use of a large industrial customer has been restricted under an interruptible tariff. Additional wells have been and will be developed to address short-term supply deficiencies. MOAWC is working with a consortium of
agencies to determine a long-term supply solution for the Joplin, Missouri region.

Indiana

Indiana-American Water Company, Inc., which we refer to as INAWC, serves a population of approximately 1 million and generated approximately
$156.4 million of operating revenue in 2008, representing approximately 7.5% of operating revenue of our Regulated Businesses for that period.

In Indiana, our infrastructure and assets are designed to collect, treat and distribute water from a variety of surface water sources (including rivers, streams, lakes and reservoirs) and groundwater sources. In 2008, we obtained 39% of our
water supply from surface water sources and 59% from groundwater sources. Purchased treated water accounted for 2% of water supply for the same period.

INAWC currently operates six surface water treatment plants and approximately 30 groundwater treatment plants, which process water extracted from more than 125 groundwater wells. We maintain six dams and



approximately 70 treated water storage facilities, 50 pumping stations and our water and wastewater collection and distribution systems comprise
approximately 4,300 miles of mains and collection pipes. We currently operate one wastewater treatment facility in Indiana.

At INAWC, we
employ several measures to ensure that we have adequate sources of water supply. INAWC conducts and updates comprehensive planning studies for each of its water utilities to identify and plan for long-term customer demand trends. In order to provide
uninterrupted water service, new source of supply and water treatment capital projects are planned and timed to match increases in customer demand and/or changes in the yield of existing sources of supply and treatment capacities. For example, to
serve our high growth Indianapolis southern Suburban market, our London Road Project will utilize a new well field and treatment plant that will satisfy the significant needs of increased population and economic development. Further, these
facilities are built to be incrementally expandable to match further growth over the next 10 years. In cases of extreme demand (such as drought conditions), customer demand-management plans are in place to sustain water sources through to normal
demand conditions. INAWC Noblesville District, a high growth northern suburb of Indianapolis, successfully managed high demand in 2007’s heat wave/drought condition through the use of its demand management plan. Further, emergency connections
to alternate water sources are in place in some drought-sensitive Indiana American Water Company, Inc. districts.

California

California-American Water Company, which we refer to as CAWC, serves a population of approximately 0.6 million and generated $128.6 million of
operating revenue in 2008, representing approximately 6.2% of operating revenue of our Regulated Businesses for that period.

In
California, our infrastructure and assets are designed to collect, treat and distribute water from a variety of surface water sources (including rivers, streams, lakes and reservoirs) and groundwater sources. In 2008, we obtained 1% of our water
supply from surface water sources and 66% from groundwater sources. Purchased treated water accounted for 33% of water supply for the same period.

CAWC currently operates one surface water treatment plant and approximately 140 groundwater treatment plants, which process water extracted from more than 170 groundwater wells. We maintain three dams, approximately 90 treated water storage
facilities, 115 pumping stations, and our water and wastewater collection and distribution systems comprise approximately 2,700 miles of mains and collection pipes. We currently operate eight wastewater treatment facilities in California.

In California, in order to ensure that we have adequate sources of water supply we are in the permitting stages to obtain approval for the
construction of a desalination plant to serve our customers on the Monterey Peninsula, we are designing new groundwater wells in our Larkfield district, and in other areas, we are making arrangements to extend or expand our purchase of water from
neighboring water providers. As part of our San Clemente Dam project, under the supervision of the Division of Safety of Dams (DSOD), we also have been investigating alternatives for complying with seismic safety requirements at our San Clemente Dam
on the Carmel River, including strengthening or removing the dam, and, in February 2009, informed DSOD that we plan to implement the dam strengthening project pursuant to our application pending before DSOD.

West Virginia

West Virginia-American Water Company,
which we refer to as WVAWC, and its subsidiary Bluefield Valley Water Works Company, which we refer to as BFV, serve a population of nearly 0.6 million and generated approximately $115.7 million of operating revenue in 2008, representing
approximately 5.5% of operating revenue of our Regulated Businesses for that period.

In West Virginia, our infrastructure and assets are
designed to collect, treat and distribute water from a variety of surface water sources (including streams, lakes and reservoirs), and in 2008 we obtained 100% of our water supply from surface water sources.



WVAWC currently operates nine surface water treatment plants. We maintain four dams, approximately 170
treated water storage facilities, 235 pumping stations and our water collection and distribution systems comprise approximately 3,400 miles of mains and collection pipes. We currently operate one wastewater treatment facility in West Virginia.

In West Virginia, our surface water supplies are sufficient to meet demand under all but the most extreme drought conditions. Such drought
conditions would be atypical for West Virginia, which has an average annual rainfall of 44 inches.

Customers

We have a large and geographically diverse customer base in our Regulated Businesses. For the purposes of our Regulated Businesses, each customer
represents a connection to our water and/or wastewater networks. As in the case of apartment complexes, businesses and many homes, multiple individuals may be served by a single connection.

Residential customers make up the large majority of customers in all of the states in which we operate. In 2008, residential customers accounted for 91%
of the customers and 58% of the operating revenue of our Regulated Businesses. Residential customers are highly predictable water and wastewater services consumers and they generate stable operating revenue over time and across regions. We also
serve commercial customers, such as shops and businesses, industrial customers, such as large-scale manufacturing and production operations, and public authorities, such as government buildings and other public sector facilities, including schools.
We supply water to private fire customers for use in fire suppression systems in office buildings and other facilities and also provide bulk water supplies to other water utilities that distribute them to their own customers.

The following table sets forth the number of water and wastewater customers by customer class for our Regulated Businesses as of December 31, 2008,
2007 and 2006:

The following table sets forth water services operating revenue by customer class and wastewater
services operating revenue, excluding other water revenues, for our Regulated Businesses for 2008, 2007 and 2006:



Substantially all of our regulated water customers are metered, which allows us to measure and bill for
our customers’ water consumption, typically on a monthly basis. Our wastewater customers are billed either on a fixed charge basis or based on their water consumption.

Customer usage of water is affected by weather conditions, particularly, during the summer. Our water systems experience higher demand in the summer due
to the warmer temperatures and increased usage by customers for lawn irrigation and other outdoor uses. Summer weather that is cooler and wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and can have a downward effect on water
operating revenue and operating income. Conversely, when weather conditions are extremely dry, our systems may be affected by drought-related warnings and/or water usage restrictions imposed by governmental agencies, also serving to reduce customer
demand and operating revenue. These restrictions may be imposed at a regional or state level and may affect our service areas, regardless of our readiness to meet unrestricted customer demands. Other factors affecting our customers’ usage of
water includes declining household sizes in the United States, conservation initiatives, including the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential consumers, and the recent deterioration in economy and credit markets
which is having an adverse impact on our industrial and commercial customers operational and financial performance.

Supplies

Our water and wastewater operations require an uninterrupted supply of chemicals, energy and fuel, as well as maintenance material and other critical
inputs. Many of these inputs are subject to short-term price volatility. Long-term volatility is partially mitigated through existing procurement contracts, current supplier continuity plans and the regulatory rate setting process.

Because of our geographic diversity, we maintain relationships with many chemical, equipment and service suppliers in the marketplace, and we do not rely
on any single entity for a material amount of our supplies. We also employ a strategic sourcing process intended to ensure reliability in supply and long-term cost effectiveness. As a result of our strategic sourcing process and our strong
relationships with suppliers, we are able to mitigate interruptions in the delivery of the products and services that are critical to our operations. For example, during Hurricane Katrina, we were challenged to locate chemical suppliers not affected
by the hurricane. As a result of our previously negotiated and established relationships with a network of preferred suppliers, we were able to secure an uninterrupted supply of materials and to continue our operations in the affected areas without
interruptions.

We have back-up energy sources at key facilities or alternative sources are available to us that are able to keep our
operations running in the event of a temporary loss of our primary energy supplies.

Regulation

Economic Regulation

Our subsidiaries in the states in
which we operate our Regulated Businesses are generally subject to extensive economic regulation by their respective state PUCs. The term “economic regulation” is intended to indicate that these state PUCs regulate the economic aspects of
service to the public from systems that fall within their jurisdiction but do not generally establish water quality standards, which are set by the EPA and/or state environmental authorities and enforced through state environmental or health
agencies. State PUCs have broad authority, derived from state laws and state constitutions under which they operate, to regulate many of the economic aspects of the utilities that fall within their jurisdiction. For example, state PUCs issue
certificates of public convenience and necessity (or similar authorizations) that may be required for a company to provide public utility services in specific areas of the state. They also must approve the rates and conditions under which service is
provided to customers and have extensive authority to establish rules and regulations under which the utilities operate. Although specific authority might differ from state to state, in most states, these state PUCs must approve rates, accounting
treatments, long-term financing programs, significant capital expenditures and plant additions, transactions between the regulated subsidiary and affiliated entities, reorganizations and mergers



and acquisitions, in many instances prior to their completion. The jurisdiction exercised by each state PUC is prescribed by state laws and regulations and
therefore varies from state to state. Regulatory policies not only vary from state to state, they may change over time. These policies will affect the timing as well as the extent of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital.

Economic regulation of utilities deals with many competing, and occasionally conflicting, public interests and policy goals. The primary
responsibility of state PUCs is to achieve the overall public interest by balancing the interests of customers and the utility and its stockholders. Although the specific approach to economic regulation does vary, certain general principles are
consistent across the states in which our regulated subsidiaries operate. Based on the United States Constitution and state constitutions that prohibit confiscation of property without due process of law and just compensation, as well as state
statutory provisions and court precedent, utilities are entitled to recover, through rates charged to customers, prudent and reasonable operating costs as well as an opportunity to earn an appropriate return on our prudent, used and useful capital
investment necessary to provide service to customers and a return of our prudent, used and useful capital investment necessary to provide service to customers. The state PUCs will also generally accord a utility the right to serve specific areas and
will also provide investor-owned utilities with limited protection from competition because the requirement of an investor-owned utility to operate pursuant to a certificate of public convenience and necessity (or similar authorizations) typically
prevents other investor-owned utilities from competing with it in the authorized area. In return, the utility undertakes to provide reliable service on a nondiscriminatory basis to all customers within the authorized area.

Our operating revenue is typically determined by reference to the volume of water supplied to a customer multiplied by a price-per-gallon set by a tariff
approved by the relevant state PUC. Certain states have utilized a full or partial single rate policy, under which all customers in a state or certain regions within a state are charged utilizing a single rate structure, regardless of which of our
individual systems serves them. The single tariff structure is based on costs that are determined on a state-wide or intra-state regional basis, thereby moderating the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs while lowering administrative
costs for us and our customers.

The process to obtain approval for a change in rates, or rate case, involves filing a petition with the
state PUC on a periodic basis as determined by our capital expenditures needs and our operating costs. Rate cases are normally initiated by the regulated utility whenever the utility determines it needs to recover increased operating expenses or a
return on new capital investment, or otherwise determines that its current authorized return is not sufficient, given current market conditions, to provide a reasonable return on investment. Typically a rate case will not be filed, however, unless
the current or expected future return is below the allowed rate of return currently authorized by the regulator. A state PUC may also initiate a rate proceeding or investigation if it believes a utility may be earning in excess of its authorized
rate of return. Rate cases often involve a lengthy and costly administrative process. The utility, the state PUC staff, consumer advocates and any other interveners who may participate in the process prepare and file evidence, consisting of
supporting testimony and documentation. This is presented in public hearings in connection with the rate case. These hearings, which are economic and service quality fact-finding in nature, are typically conducted in a trial-like setting before the
state PUC or an administrative law judge. During the process, the utility is required to provide staff and interveners with all relevant information they may request concerning the utility’s operations, expenses and investments. The sworn
evidentiary record then forms the basis for a state PUC decision.

Some state PUCs are more restrictive than others with regard to the
types of expenses and investments that may be recovered in rates as well as with regard to the transparency of their rate-making processes, and how they reach their final rate determinations. However, in evaluating a rate case, state PUCs typically
focus on five areas:

•

the amount and prudence of investment in facilities considered “used and useful” in providing public service;

•

the operating and maintenance costs and taxes associated with providing the service (typically by making reference to a representative 12-month period of time,
known as a test year);

•

the appropriate rate of return;



•

the tariff or rate design that allocates operating revenue requirements equitably across the customer base; and

•

the quality of service the utility provides, including issues raised by customers.

The decisions of state PUCs and the timing of those decisions can have a significant impact on the operations and earnings of our Regulated Businesses.
Rate cases and other rate-related proceedings can take several months to over a year to complete. Therefore, there is frequently a delay, or regulatory lag, between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an
operating expense increase and when those costs are reflected in rates. For instance, an unexpected increase in chemical costs or new capital investment that is not appropriately reflected in the most recently completed rate case will generally not
be recovered by the regulated subsidiary until the next rate case is filed and approved by the state PUC. Our rate case management program is guided by the goals of obtaining efficient recovery of costs of capital and utility operating and
maintenance costs, including costs incurred for compliance with environmental regulations. The management team at each of our regulated subsidiaries anticipates the time required for the regulatory process and files a rate case with the goal of
obtaining rates that reflect as closely as possible the cost of providing service at the time the rates become effective. Even if rates are sufficient, we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital and a
return of our invested capital that are permitted by the state PUC.

Our regulated subsidiaries also pursue methods to minimize the adverse
impact of regulatory lag and have worked with state PUCs and legislatures to implement a number of approaches to achieve this result. A number of states in which our Regulated Businesses operate have adopted efficient rate policies, including some
form of single tariff pricing, forward-looking test years, pass-through provisions or infrastructure surcharges. Forward-looking test years and infrastructure surcharges reduce the regulatory lag associated with the traditional method of recovering
rates from state PUCs through lengthy rate cases based on historical information. Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois are examples of states that have adopted a full or partial single tariff pricing policy.

Also, an increasing number of states are permitting rates to be adjusted outside of a general rate case for certain costs, such as a
return on capital investments to replace aging infrastructure or increases in expenses beyond the utility’s control, such as purchased water costs. This infrastructure surcharge mechanism allows our rates to be adjusted and charged to customers
outside the context of a general rate proceeding for pre-specified portions of our capital expenditures to replace aging infrastructure closer to the time these expenses are incurred. For example, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Missouri, Indiana, New York,
and Ohio are examples of states that have in the past allowed tariffs that permit the imposition of surcharges on customers’ bills for infrastructure replacement. New Jersey, California, Virginia and Illinois have allowed surcharges for
purchased water costs, California has allowed surcharges for power, and New York has allowed surcharges for certain costs such as power and chemicals. These constructive regulatory mechanisms encourage us to maintain a steady capital expenditure
program to repair and improve water and wastewater systems as needed by reducing the regulatory lag on the recovery of prudent expenditures.

The forward-looking test year mechanism allows us to earn on a more timely basis a return of our current or projected costs and a rate of return on our current or projected invested capital and other “known and measurable changes”
in our business. Some states have permitted use of some form of forecast or forward-looking test year instead of historical data to set rates. Examples of these states include Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Tennessee and
California. In addition, a number of states in which we operate have allowed the utility to update historical data for certain changes that occur for some limited period of time subsequent to the historical test year. This allows the utility to take
account of some more current costs or capital investments in the rate-setting process. Examples of these states include New Mexico, Texas, Missouri, Iowa, Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, New Jersey and Arizona.

Also, some of the states in which we operate permit pass-through provisions that allow for an increase in certain operating costs, such as purchased
power and property taxes to be passed on to and recovered from customers outside of a general rate case proceeding.



Another regulatory mechanism to address issues of regulatory lag includes the potential ability, in
certain circumstances, to recover in rates a return on utility plant before it is actually in service, instead of capitalizing an allowance for funds used during construction. Examples of states that have allowed such recovery include Texas,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, Virginia, Illinois and California.

In addition, some states have permitted us to seek pre-approval of
certain capital projects and associated costs. In this pre-approval process, the PUCs assess the prudency of such projects.

The ability of
the Company to seek regulatory treatment as described above does not guarantee that the state PUCs will accept the Company’s proposal in the context of a particular rate case. However, the Company strives to use these and other regulatory
policies to address issues of regulatory lag wherever appropriate and to expand their use in areas where they may not currently apply.

Environmental,
Health and Safety and Water Quality Regulation

Our water and wastewater operations are subject to extensive United States federal,
state and local and, in the case of our Canadian operations, Canadian laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, health and safety, the quality of the water we deliver to our customers, water allocation rights and the manner
in which we collect, treat, discharge and dispose of wastewater. We are also subject to certain regulations regarding fire protection services in the areas we serve. These regulations include the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Water Act and
other federal, state, local and Canadian laws and regulations governing the provision of water and wastewater services, particularly with respect to the quality of water we distribute. We also are subject to various federal, state, local and
Canadian laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardous materials, the management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes, discharges to air and water, the cleanup of contaminated sites, dam safety and other matters relating to the
protection of the environment, health and safety. State PUCs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver.

We maintain a comprehensive environmental policy including responsible business practices, compliance with environmental laws and regulations, effective use of natural resources, and stewardship of biodiversity. We believe that our
operations are in material compliance with, and in many cases surpass, minimum standards required by applicable environmental laws and regulations. Water samples across our water system are analyzed on a regular basis in material compliance with
regulatory requirements. Across the Company, we conduct nearly one million water quality tests each year at our laboratory facilities in addition to continuous on-line instrumentations such as monitoring turbidity levels, disinfectant residuals and
adjustments to chemical treatment based on changes in incoming water. For 2008, we achieved greater than a 99.9% compliance rate for meeting state and federal drinking water standards and 99.2% for compliance with wastewater requirements.

We participate in the Partnership for Safe Water, the United States EPA’s voluntary program to meet more stringent goals for reducing
microbes. Currently, 70 of our facilities have received the program’s “Director” award and 65 have maintained it for more than five years.

For fiscal year 2008, our aggregate capital expenditures for environmental, health and safety and water quality regulatory compliance were approximately $150.0 million, and we currently expect to spend similar amounts
for such matters in fiscal year 2009.

Safe Drinking Water Act

The Federal Safe Drinking Water Act and regulations promulgated thereunder establish national quality standards for drinking water. The EPA has issued rules governing the levels of numerous naturally occurring and
man-made chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water and continues to propose new rules. These rules also prescribe testing requirements for detecting contaminants, the treatment systems which may be used for
removing contaminants and other requirements. Federal and state water quality requirements have become increasingly more stringent, including increased water testing requirements, to reflect public health concerns.



For example, in 2001, the EPA decreased permissible arsenic levels in drinking water and required
compliance by water systems by January 2006. In 2003, a new EPA rule governing non-radon radionuclides became effective, regulating uranium in drinking water for the first time and requiring initial monitoring under state programs by the end of
2007. We believe that we are in material compliance with both these rules.

In order to remove or inactivate microbial organisms, the EPA
has promulgated various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinking water and to reduce consumers’ exposure to disinfectants and byproducts of the disinfection process. In January 2006, the EPA promulgated the Long-term 2
Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule and the Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproduct Rule. In October 2006, the EPA finalized the Ground Water Rule, applicable to water systems providing water from underground sources. In 2006, the EPA
also proposed revisions to the monitoring and reporting requirements of the existing Lead and Copper Rule.

Although it is difficult to
project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements, we do not expect current requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act to have a material impact on our operations or financial condition. In addition,
capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental mandates traditionally have been recognized by state public utility commissions as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates. As a result, we expect to fully recover the
operating and capital costs resulting from these pending or future requirements.

Clean Water Act

The Federal Clean Water Act regulates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes, rivers, streams and groundwater. In
addition to requirements applicable to our sewer collection systems, our operations require discharge permits under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, or NPDES, permit program established under the Clean Water Act. Pursuant to the
NPDES program, the EPA or implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems. We believe that we maintain the necessary permits and approvals for the discharges from our water
and wastewater facilities. From time to time, discharge violations occur at our facilities, some of which result in fines. We do not expect any such violations or fines to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.

Other Environmental, Health and Safety and Water Quality Matters

Our operations also involve the use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. For example, our water and wastewater treatment facilities store and use chlorine and other chemicals and generate wastes
that require proper handling and disposal under applicable environmental requirements. We also could incur remedial costs in connection with any contamination relating to our operations or facilities or our off-site disposal of wastes. Although we
are not aware of any material cleanup or decontamination obligations, the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations in the future could result in additional costs. Our facilities and operations also are subject to requirements
under the United States Occupational Safety and Health Act and are subject to inspections thereunder. For further information, see “Business—Research and Development.”

Certain of our subsidiaries are involved in pending legal proceedings relating to environmental matters. These proceedings are described further in the
section entitled “Item 3—Legal Proceedings.”

Growth

In the course of pursuing our growth strategy, we periodically acquire water and wastewater utilities by making acquisitions in our existing markets and
certain markets in the United States where we do not currently operate our Regulated Businesses. We have executed a number of larger acquisitions in the past 10 years. In 1996, our regulated subsidiary, PAWC, acquired the regulated water utility
operations of Pennsylvania Gas and Water Company, a subsidiary of Pennsylvania Enterprises Inc., for approximately $409.4 million. In 1999, we



acquired the privately held National Enterprises Inc., in a transaction valued at $700.0 million. In 2002, we acquired the water and wastewater
facilities in six states from Citizens Communications Company for an aggregate purchase price of $979.8 million. We also acquire water and wastewater utilities through tuck-ins. The proximity of tuck-in opportunities to our regulated footprint
allows us to integrate and manage the acquired systems and operations using our existing management and to achieve efficiencies. Historically, pursuing tuck-ins has been a fundamental part of our growth strategy. We intend to continue to grow our
regulated footprint through tuck-in acquisitions of small water and/or wastewater systems. Tuck-ins allow us to integrate systems, operations and management and achieve efficiencies. We intend to continue to expand our regulated footprint
geographically by acquiring water and wastewater systems in our existing markets and, if appropriate, certain markets in the United States where we do not currently operate our Regulated Businesses.

The chart below sets forth our historical tuck-ins for 1996 through December 2008. In addition to the 10 acquisitions completed in 2008, there are
another three transactions that were signed in 2008 and are expected to be completed in 2009, the largest of which is the Trenton acquisition.

While our business mix will continue to focus predominantly on regulated activities, we are pursuing
opportunities in non-regulated businesses that are complementary to our Regulated Businesses and our capabilities. We plan to focus on our public/private partnerships, including O&M and military contracts and services. We intend to capitalize on
our O&M expertise as well as our existing municipal and government relationships to identify and bid for new ventures that have attractive risk and return characteristics. We also intend to continue to expand our non-regulated Homeowner Services
business, which provides services to domestic homeowners to protect against the cost of repairing broken or leaking pipes inside and outside their homes, in areas within and beyond our existing regulated footprint.

Competition and Condemnation

In our Regulated
Businesses, we generally do not face direct or indirect competition in providing services in our existing markets because (i) we operate within those markets pursuant to certificates of public convenience and necessity (or similar
authorizations) issued by state PUCs and (ii) the high cost of constructing a new water and wastewater system in an existing market creates a barrier to market entry. Our Regulated Businesses do face competition from governmental agencies,
other investor-owned utilities and strategic buyers in connection with entering new markets and making strategic acquisitions. Consolidation is changing the competitive landscape as small local utilities struggle to meet their capital spending
requirements and look to partner with investor-owned utilities. We also face competition in offering services to new real estate developers, where we compete with others on the basis of the financial terms we offer for our services, the availability
of water and our ability to commence providing services on a timely basis. Our largest investor-owned competitors, based on a comparison of operating revenues and population served, are Aqua America Inc., United Water (owned by Suez Environment
Company S.A.), American States Water Co. and California Water Services Group.



The certificates of public convenience and necessity (or similar authorizations) pursuant to which we
operate our Regulated Businesses do not prevent municipalities from competing with us to provide water and wastewater utility services. Further, the potential exists that portions of our subsidiaries’ utility assets could be acquired by
municipalities or other local government entities through one or more of the following methods:

•

eminent domain (also known as condemnation);

•

the right of purchase given or reserved by a municipality or political subdivision when the original certificate was granted; and

•

the right of purchase given or reserved under the law of the state in which the utility subsidiary was incorporated or from which it received its certificate.

The sale price for such a transaction initiated by a local government may be determined consistent with applicable
eminent domain law, or the price may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or in the particular franchise or charter. We believe our operating subsidiaries would be entitled to fair market value for any assets
required to be sold, and we are of the opinion that fair market value would be in excess of the book value for such assets.

We are
periodically subject to condemnation proceedings in the ordinary course of business. On September 5, 2008, California American Water sold the assets of our Felton, California water system, which served approximately 1,330 customers, to the San
Lorenzo Valley Water District. The most recent prior sale of our water and wastewater systems under threat of condemnation occurred in 2003. We actively monitor condemnation activities that may affect us as soon as we become aware of them. We do not
believe that condemnation poses a material threat to our ability to operate our Regulated Businesses.

Our Non-Regulated Businesses

In addition to our Regulated Businesses, we operate the following Non-Regulated Businesses, which generated $272.2 million of operating revenue in
2008 representing 11.6% of total operating revenue for the same periods. No single group within our Non-Regulated Businesses generates in excess of 10% of our aggregate revenue.

Contract Operations Group

Our Contract Operations Group enters into public/private
partnerships, including O&M and DBO contracts for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for municipalities, the United States military and other customers. We typically make no capital investment under our contracts with
municipalities and other customers, instead performing our services for a fee. We may make limited capital investments under our contracts with the United States military. Our Contract Operations Group generated revenue of $170.1 million in 2008,
representing 62.5% of revenue for our Non-Regulated Businesses.

We are currently party to more than 49 contracts across the United States
and Canada, with contracts ranging in term from three to 50 years. The services provided under our O&M contracts vary in size and scope. For instance, 44 of our O&M contracts are operational in nature with repair and replace elements but not
DBOs. Annual operating revenue from the O&M contracts varies from $0.3 million to $8.2 million per contract. In addition, we are an active participant in the United States Department of Defense’s Utility Privatization Program, or UPP.
The Department of Defense has awarded us seven 50-year contracts for the operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems since 2003, and we have one 3-year sub-contract with a municipality, acting as primary contractor with the
Department of Defense, for similar services on an interim basis until construction of new connections to an existing municipal facility is completed. Remaining lifetime revenue under all these O&M contracts total approximately $2,288.8 million
as of December 31, 2008. All of the contracts with the U.S. government may be terminated, in whole or in part, prior to the end of the 50-year term for convenience of the U.S. government or as a result of default or non-performance by the
subsidiary performing the contract. In either event, we are entitled to recover the remaining amount of our capital investment pursuant to the terms of a termination settlement with the U.S. government at the time of termination as provided in each
of the contracts.



The contract price for each of these contracts is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter.
Price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions.

In general, the Contract Operations Group is engaged in providing these services to systems with over 3,000 customers (and in many cases far larger) as
distinguished from the O&M services provided by our Applied Water Management Group usually to systems with less than 3,000 customers. However, there is some overlap in size of systems served due to geographic and operational considerations.

Applied Water Management Group

Our Applied Water Management Group works with customers to design, build and operate smaller-scale water and wastewater treatment plants (typically serving up to 3,000 customers). Our typical customers are real estate developers, industrial
companies and new or expanding communities. We specialize in providing reliable, advanced and eco-friendly water and wastewater solutions to suit each customer’s water needs. Our Applied Water Management Group generated revenue of $23.8 million
in 2008, representing 8.7% of revenue for our Non-Regulated Businesses.

The Applied Water Management Group currently serves our customer
base primarily in the Northeastern United States and was responsible for the design, construction and operation of advanced wastewater treatment recycling systems for sites as varied as residential buildings in Battery Park City in New York City and
Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts. Approximately 38% of the Applied Water Management Group’s business involves operating and maintaining smaller-scale water and wastewater plants, made up of a mixture of facilities that we designed
and built, and some which we only operate.

Homeowner Services Group

Our Homeowner Services Group provides services to domestic homeowners to protect against the cost of repairing broken or leaking pipes inside and outside
their homes. We initially offered these services within territories covered by our regulated subsidiaries, but are expanding to enable other utilities outside our territories to offer the services to their customers. In the marketing of these
services, we focus on educating homeowners about their service line ownership responsibility and providing convenient and cost effective solutions to internal and external water line and sewer line repairs. Our Homeowner Services Group generated
revenue of $47.5 million in 2008, representing 17.5% of revenue for our Non-Regulated Businesses.

Our Service Line Protection Programs
offer customers various service contracts for a monthly fee that cover repair of water line leaks and breaks, sewer line clogs and blockages and emergency in-home plumbing problems. In the event of a problem, customers contact our national call
center and we dispatch local contractors to the customer’s home to undertake the necessary repairs.

Our Homeowners Services Group
currently has approximately 680,000 customer contracts in 15 of the states where we operate our Regulated Businesses. We intend to expand our service offering to the remaining key states in which we operate our Regulated Businesses as well as other
viable territories.

Building on the success of its Service Line Protection
Programs, our Homeowner Services Group recently introduced LineSaver™, an exclusive program for municipalities and public water systems that is available across the country. The LineSaver™ program involves partnering with municipalities to
offer our protection programs to homeowners serviced by the municipal system while providing an income opportunity to the municipality or public water system. We entered into our first Line Saver

™

Program partnership with the city of Trenton, New Jersey and are currently discussing partnerships with municipalities across the nation.



Other Non-Regulated Businesses

Our Non-Regulated Businesses also include (i) our Carbon Services Group, which provides granular activated carbon for water purification to our
Regulated Businesses as well as certain outside customers and (ii) our Residuals Group, Terratec, which provides environmentally sustainable management and disposal of biosolids and wastewater by-products. Our United States-based Residuals
Group was divested effective June 29, 2007. These other Non-Regulated Businesses generated revenue of $30.8 million in 2008 in the aggregate, representing 11.3% of revenue for our Non-Regulated Businesses.

Competition

We face competition in our
Non-Regulated Businesses from a number of service providers, including Veolia, American States, OMI and Southwest Water, particularly in the area of O&M contracting. Securing new O&M contracts is highly competitive, as these contracts are
awarded based on a combination of customer relationships, service levels, competitive pricing, references and technical expertise. We also face competition in maintaining existing O&M contracts to which we are a party, as these frequently come
up for renegotiation and are subject to an open bidding process.

Research and Development

We established a formal research and development program in 1981 with the goal of improving water quality and operational effectiveness in all areas of
our businesses. Our research and development personnel are located at two of our facilities: the regional center in Voorhees, New Jersey and our research laboratory in Delran, New Jersey. In addition, our quality control and testing
laboratory in Belleville, Illinois supports research through sophisticated testing and analysis. Since its inception, our research and development program has evolved to become a leading water-related research program, achieving advancements in the
science of drinking water, including sophisticated water testing procedures and desalination technologies.

Since the formation of the EPA
in 1970, we have collaborated with the agency to achieve effective environmental, health and safety and water quality regulation. This relationship has developed to include sharing of our research and national water quality monitoring data in
addition to our treatment and distribution system optimization research. Our engagement with the EPA has helped us to achieve a leadership position for our company within the water and wastewater industry and has provided us with early insight into
emerging regulatory issues and initiatives, thereby allowing us to anticipate and to accommodate our future compliance requirements.

In
2008, we spent $2.5 million on research and development, which represents an increase of 25% over the $2.0 million spent in 2007. Approximately one-third of our research budget is comprised of competitively awarded outside research grants. Such
grants reduce the cost of research and allow collaboration with leading national and international researchers.

We believe that
continued research and development activities are critical to maintaining our leadership position in the industry and will provide us with a competitive advantage as we seek additional business with new and existing customers.

Support Services

Our American Water Works Service
Company subsidiary provides centrally administered professional services to our Regulated Businesses under the terms of contracts with these companies that have been approved by state PUCs, where necessary. These services, which are provided at
cost, may include accounting, administration, business development, communications, corporate secretarial, engineering, financial, health and safety, human resources, information systems, legal, operations, procurement, rates, security, risk
management, water quality and research and development. Similar services may be provided to our Non-Regulated Businesses. These arrangements afford our affiliated companies professional and technical talent on an economical and timely basis.



We operate two national customer service centers, with personnel located in Alton, Illinois and
Pensacola, Florida. These centers employ approximately 700 people in total and process telephone calls from customers across all of our service areas.

Community Relations

Corporate responsibility is a critical part of how we do business at American Water. From our community
involvement to the steps we have taken to reduce our environmental footprint, we believe that we have the opportunity to drive our business from a broader perspective, one that inspires and wins customer, community, employee and shareholder loyalty
and support through responsible business practices.

Corporate responsibility encompasses four main areas at American Water, including
Environmental Responsibility, Economic Health, Social Well-Being and Governance. Together, these focus areas are designed to create shareholder value in a number of ways including, attracting and retaining talent, avoiding operational and
reputational risk and identifying new opportunities that respond to sustainable solutions.

Communication activities for our Regulated
Businesses are designed to ensure that our customers, regulators, elected and appointed officials, as well as, community leaders are fully informed about water and wastewater-related issues affecting their communities. We focus on developing
effective relationships and have in place experienced staff members in the areas of community relations, government relations, media relations and marketing. We believe that an informed customer is more likely to be a satisfied customer.

Our primary focus for our Regulated Businesses is on consumer education. We target our communications to ensure that all of our audiences are well
informed and up-to-date on water and wastewater-related issues through community outreach meetings, bill inserts to our customers, newspaper articles on timely topics, paid advertisements on important issues, annual water quality reports or
one-on-one meetings to update key community and government leaders. We continually provide information on topics such as the need for infrastructure investments that we are making within a community, the impact on rates and services, water supply
needs, water conservation requirements, as well as information on water quality. We believe that educating our customers about these topics leads to greater understanding of the service issues that we face and results in a higher level of customer
satisfaction. For instance, we believe that our customers are less likely to react negatively to a rate increase if they have been informed that the rate increase is necessitated by an infrastructure investment necessary to continue to provide high
quality water service. We also believe that our customers are less likely to have a negative reaction to water use restrictions if they understand the reasons behind the restrictions and that all customers are being impacted by the same
inconveniences.

Communications activities for our Non-Regulated Businesses focus on identifying prospective market opportunities for
growth and expansion and educating target markets on the value we can bring to solving specific water supply, water quality or other water and wastewater-related issues. Our experienced business development team reinforces the expertise, experience
and capabilities we can provide to communities or developers through industry trade shows, public speaking opportunities, industry conferences and paid advertising, public-private partnerships or contract relationships, which may include DBO
projects for customers or providing experienced O&M services for various sized water and wastewater-related projects.

Employee Matters

Currently we employ approximately 7,300 full-time employees. Of these, approximately 3,700, or approximately 51%, are represented by
unions. We have 76 collective bargaining agreements in place with the 20 different unions representing our unionized employees. Approximately one-fourth of our local union contracts expire annually. We maintain good relations with our unionized
workforce and have no significant history of strikes or labor stoppages.



Training

We place emphasis on the selection of well-qualified employees and seek to provide the best and most up-to-date training to ensure that our water and wastewater operations function efficiently and safely. We provide internal training
programs designed to meet the standards demanded by the regulatory authorities in the states where we operate our regulated business.

Security

Due to terrorist and other risks, we have heightened security at our facilities over the past several years and have taken added
precautions to protect our employees and the water delivered to our customers. We have a security programs department that provides oversight and governance of physical and information security throughout our operations and is responsible for
designing, implementing, monitoring and supporting active and effective physical and information security controls.

In 2002, federal
legislation was enacted that resulted in new regulations concerning security of water facilities, including those that required companies to submit vulnerability assessment studies to the federal government. We have complied with EPA regulations
concerning vulnerability assessments and have made filings to the EPA as required. Vulnerability assessments are conducted regularly to evaluate the effectiveness of existing security controls and serve as the basis for further capital investment in
security for the facility. Information security controls are deployed or integrated to prevent unauthorized access to company information systems, assure the continuity of business processes dependent upon automation, ensure the integrity of our
data and support regulatory and legislative compliance requirements. In addition, communication plans have been developed as a component of our procedures. While we do not make public comments on the details of our security programs, we have been in
contact with federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate and improve the security of our water delivery systems and to safeguard our water supply.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

We operate in a market and regulatory
environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, the following factors should be considered in evaluating our
business and future prospects. Any of the following risks, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business,
financial condition, operating results and prospects could be adversely affected, which in turn could adversely affect the value of our common stock.

Risks Related to Our Industry and Business

Our utility operations are heavily regulated. Decisions by state PUCs and other
regulatory agencies can significantly affect our business and results of operations.

Our Regulated Businesses provide water and
wastewater services to our customers through subsidiaries economically regulated by state PUCs. Economic regulation affects the rates we charge our customers and has a significant effect on our business and results of operations. Generally, the
state PUCs authorize us to charge rates that they determine are sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses, to enable us to finance the addition of new, or the replacement of existing, water and wastewater infrastructure and to
allow us the opportunity to earn what they determine to be an appropriate rate of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital.

Our ability to meet our financial objectives depends upon the rates authorized by the various state PUCs. We periodically file rate increase applications with state PUCs. The ensuing administrative process may be
lengthy and costly. We can provide no assurances that our rate increase requests will be granted. Even if approved, there is no guarantee that approval will be given in a timely manner or at a sufficient level to cover our expenses, the recovery of
our investment and/or provide us an opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment and a return of our investment. If the authorized rates are insufficient to cover operating expenses, to allow for the recovery of our investment
and to provide an appropriate return on invested capital, or if the rate increase decisions are delayed, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity may be adversely affected. Even if rates are sufficient, we face the
risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital that are permitted by the state PUC.

Our operations and the quality of water we supply are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations. Our operating costs have increased, and are expected to continue to increase, as a result of complying with environmental
laws and regulations. We also could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations.

Our water and wastewater operations are subject to extensive United States Federal, state and local and, in the case of our Canadian operations, Canadian, laws and regulations, that govern the protection of the environment, health and
safety, the quality of the water we deliver to our customers, water allocation rights, and the manner in which we collect, treat, discharge and dispose of wastewater. These requirements include the United States Clean Water Act of 1972, which we
refer to as the Clean Water Act, and the United States Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, which we refer to as the Safe Drinking Water Act, and similar state and Canadian laws and regulations. We are also required to obtain various environmental
permits from regulatory agencies for our operations. State PUCs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver. If we deliver water or wastewater services to our customers that do not comply with regulatory
standards, or otherwise violate environmental laws, regulations or permits, or other health and safety and water quality regulations, we could incur substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions or costs or damage to our reputation. In the most
serious cases, regulators could force us to discontinue operations and sell our operating assets to another utility or municipality. Given the nature of our business which, in part, involves supplying water for human



consumption, any potential non-compliance with, or violation of, environmental laws or regulations would likely pose a more significant risk to us than to an
issuer not similarly involved in the water and wastewater industry.

We incur substantial operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis
to comply with environmental laws and regulations and other health and safety and water quality regulations. These laws and regulations, and their enforcement, have tended to become more stringent over time, and new or stricter requirements could
increase our costs. Although we may seek to recover ongoing compliance costs in our rates, there can be no guarantee that the various state PUCs or similar regulatory bodies that govern our Regulated Businesses would approve rate increases to
recover such costs or that such costs will not adversely and materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.

We may also incur liabilities under environmental laws and regulations requiring us to investigate and clean up environmental contamination at our properties or at off-site locations where we have disposed of waste or
caused adverse environmental impacts. The discovery of previously unknown conditions, or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future, could result in significant costs, and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of
operations, cash flow and liquidity. Such remediation losses may not be covered by our insurance policies and may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates.

Market disruptions caused by the worldwide financial crisis could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet
long-term commitments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

We rely on our revolving
credit facility and the capital markets to satisfy our liquidity needs. Further disruptions in the credit markets or further deterioration of the banking industry’s financial condition, may discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their
existing lending commitments, extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments. Market disruptions may also limit our ability to issue debt securities in the capital markets. On September 15, 2008, we sought to issue commercial
paper but were unable to consummate the issuance due to adverse market conditions. In order to meet our short-term liquidity needs we are borrowing under our existing $840 million revolving credit facility. Commitments under this revolving credit
facility of $685 million mature on September 15, 2013, and the remaining $155 million expire on September 15, 2012. American Water Capital Corp. (“AWCC”), our financing subsidiary, had $345.0 million of outstanding borrowings and $43.9
million of outstanding letters of credit under this credit facility as of February 23, 2009. AWCC had $178.5 million of outstanding overnight commercial paper as of February 23, 2009. We can provide no assurances that our lenders will meet their
existing commitments or that we will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company has issued through its subsidiaries $120.3 million of variable rate demand bonds which are periodically remarketed. During the months of January and February 2009, AWCC purchased its variable rate demand
bonds because no buyer was willing to purchase the bonds at market rates. At February 23, 2009, AWCC holds all $120.3 million in treasury. We can provide no assurances that the bonds will be remarketed successfully or at reasonable interest rates.

Longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, reduced financing alternatives or failures of
significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our business. Any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the market stabilizes or until alternative financing can be
arranged. Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures, reducing dividend payments, and reducing other discretionary expenditures.

Continued market disruptions could cause a broad economic downturn which may lead to increased incidence of customers’ failure to pay for services delivered, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and
cash flow.

The capital market disruptions could result in higher interest rates on publicly issued debt securities, increased commercial
paper borrowing costs, and increased costs related to variable rate debt. As a result, continuation of the market disruptions could increase the Company’s interest expense and adversely impact our results of operations.



The disruption in the capital markets and its actual or perceived effects on particular businesses and
the greater economy also adversely affects the value of the investments held within the Company’s employee benefit plan trusts. Significant declines in the value of the investments held within the Company’s employee benefit plan trusts may
require the Company to increase contributions to those trusts in order to meet future funding requirements if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in value in the foreseeable future. These trends may also adversely impact the
Company’s results of operations, net cash flows and financial positions, including our shareholders’ equity.

Market conditions may
unfavorably impact the value of benefit plan assets and liabilities which then could require significant additional funding.

The
performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans and could significantly impact our results of operations and
financial position. The Company has significant obligations in these areas and the Company holds significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations, which may affect investment returns, which may fall below the
Company’s projected return rates. A decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets, as was experienced in 2008, will increase the funding requirements under the Company’s pension and postretirement
benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in value. Additionally, the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates decrease, the
liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements. Further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the funding requirements
of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Also, future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable from our customers, and our the
results of operations and financial position of the Company could be negatively affected.

During 2008, the Company’s unfunded status
of its pension plan increased significantly primarily due to lower than expected 2008 asset returns, which are expected to result in increased benefit costs and required funding contributions in future years. Based on current plan assets and
expected future asset returns, the Company currently estimates the increase to pension and postretirement expense (net of capitalized amounts) in 2009 to be approximately $32 million, pre-tax. It is the Company’s intent to work with PUCs in the
states in which it operates to minimize the impact of such increases on its results of operations. The Company currently expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts of $125.9 million, $132.5 million, $124.7
million, $161.9 million and $123.2 million in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively. Actual amounts contributed could change significantly from these estimates.

Changes in laws and regulations over which we have no control can significantly affect our business and results of operations.

Any governmental entity that regulates our operations may enact new legislation or adopt new regulations or policies at any time, and new judicial
decisions may change the interpretation of existing legislation or regulations at any time. The individuals who serve as regulators are elected or are political appointees. Therefore, elections which result in a change of political administration or
new appointments may also result in changes in the individuals who serve as regulators and the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve. New laws or regulations, new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, or changes in agency
policy, including as a response to shifts in public opinion, or conditions imposed during the regulatory hearing process may affect our business in a number of ways, including the following:

•

making it more difficult for us to raise our rates and, as a consequence, to recover our costs or earn our expected rates of return;

•

changing the determination of the costs, or the amount of costs, that would be considered recoverable in rate cases;



•

changing water quality or delivery service standards or wastewater collection, treatment, discharge and disposal standards with which we must comply;

•

restricting our ability to terminate our services to customers who owe us money for services previously provided;

•

requiring us to provide water services at reduced rates to certain customers;

•

restricting our ability to sell assets or issue securities;

•

changing regulatory benefits that we expected to receive when we began offering services in a particular area;

•

changing or placing additional limitations on change in control requirements relating to any concentration of ownership of our common stock;

•

making it easier for governmental entities to convert our assets to public ownership via eminent domain;

•

restricting or prohibiting our extraction of water from rivers, streams, reservoirs or aquifers; and

•

revoking or altering the terms of the certificates of public convenience and necessity (or similar authorizations) issued to us by state PUCs.

Any of these changes or any other changes in laws, regulations, judicial decisions or agency policies applicable to us
may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.

Weather conditions, natural
hazards, availability of water supplies and competing uses may interfere with our sources of water, demand for water services and our ability to supply water to customers.

Our ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate supply of water. As a general rule, sources of public
water supply, including rivers, lakes, streams and groundwater aquifers are held in the public trust and are not owned by private interests. As such, we typically do not own the water that we use in our operations, and the availability of our water
supply is established through allocation rights and passing-flow requirements set by governmental entities. Passing-flow requirements set minimum volumes of water that must pass through specified water sources, such as rivers and streams, in order
to maintain environmental habitats and meet water allocation rights of downstream users. Allocation rights are imposed to ensure sustainability of major water sources and passing flow requirements are most often imposed on source waters from smaller
rivers, lakes and streams. These requirements can change from time to time and adversely impact our water supply. Drought, overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats or other factors may limit the availability of
ground and surface water.

Governmental restrictions on water use may also result in decreased use of water services, even if our water
supplies are sufficient to serve our customers, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Seasonal drought conditions that would impact our water services are possible across all of our service areas, and drought
conditions currently exist in several areas of the United States. However, these conditions are more prevalent in the Northeast and West where supply capacity is limited and per capita water demand is high. If a regional drought were to occur
affecting our service areas and adjacent systems, governmental restrictions may be imposed on all systems within a region independent of the supply adequacy of any individual system. There have been no mandatory water use restriction orders to date
in 2009, although voluntary conservation efforts or water use restrictions were implemented during certain periods of 2008 in parts of New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and California. Following drought conditions, water demand may not return to
pre-drought levels even after restrictions are lifted. Cool and wet weather may also reduce demand for water, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.



Service interruptions due to severe weather events are possible across all our service areas. These
include winter storms and freezing conditions in our colder climate service areas, high wind conditions in our service areas known to experience tornados, earthquakes in our service areas known to experience seismic activity, high water conditions
for our facilities located in or near designated flood plains, hurricanes in our coastal service areas and severe electrical storms which are possible across all of our service areas. These weather events may affect the condition or operability of
our facilities, limiting or preventing us from delivering water or wastewater services to our customers, or requiring us to make substantial capital expenditures to repair any damage. Any interruption in our ability to supply water or to collect,
treat and properly dispose of wastewater, or any costs associated with restoring service, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, losses from business interruptions or damage to our facilities might not
be covered by our insurance policies and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates.

Declining
residential per customer water usage may reduce our long-term revenues, financial condition and results of operations.

Increased
water conservation, including through the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential consumers, combined with declining household sizes in the United States, has contributed to a trend of declining residential per
customer water usage. Our Regulated Businesses are heavily dependent upon revenue generated from rates we charge to our residential customers for the volume of water they use. The rate we charge for our water is regulated by state PUCs, and we may
not unilaterally adjust our rates to reflect demand. Declining usage will have a negative impact on our long-term operating revenues if we are unable to secure rate increases or to grow our residential customer base to the extent necessary to offset
the residential usage decline.

Risks associated with the collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater may impose significant costs.

The wastewater collection, treatment and disposal operations of our subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation and involve
significant environmental risks. If collection or sewage systems fail, overflow or do not operate properly, untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers, causing damage to persons or
property, injury to aquatic life and economic damages, which may not be recoverable in rates. This risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding, which are the main causes of sewer overflow and system failure. Liabilities
resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, in the event that we are deemed liable for any damage caused by overflow, our losses might not be covered by
insurance policies, and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates.

Our Regulated Businesses
require significant capital expenditures to maintain infrastructure and expand our rate base and may suffer if we fail to secure appropriate funding to make investments, or if we suffer delays in completing major capital expenditure projects.

The water and wastewater utility business is capital intensive. In addition to our acquisition strategy, we invest significant
amounts of capital to add, replace and maintain property, plant and equipment. In 2008, we invested $1,008.8 million in net Company-funded capital improvements. We expect the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the integrity of
our systems to increase in the future. We fund these projects from cash generated from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper programs and the issuance of long-term debt and equity securities. We can provide
no assurances that we will be able to access the debt and equity capital markets on favorable terms or at all.

RWE has certain
registration rights with respect to future issuances of our equity securities and intends to fully divest its remaining ownership of American Water as soon as reasonably practicable, subject to market conditions. The registration rights agreement
entered into with RWE imposes certain restrictions on our ability to issue equity securities in amounts beyond specified thresholds without RWE’s consent. Sales of our common stock by RWE, as well as the restrictions in the registration rights
agreement, may make it more difficult or



costly for us to raise additional equity in the future. Furthermore, if we are unable to raise sufficient equity, we can provide no assurances that we will
be able to access the debt capital markets on favorable terms or at all.

In addition, we believe that our dividend policy could limit, but
not preclude, our ability to pursue growth. In particular, this limitation could be significant, for example, with respect to large acquisitions and growth opportunities that require cash investments in amounts greater than our operating
subsidiaries’ available cash or external financing resources. In order to fund construction expenditures, acquisitions (including tuck-in acquisitions) and principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, and pay dividends at the level
currently anticipated under our dividend policy, we expect that we will need additional financing. However, we intend to retain sufficient cash from operating activities after the distribution of dividends to fund a portion of our capital
expenditures. For further discussion of our acquisition strategy, see “Item 1—Growth.”

If we are unable to obtain
sufficient capital, we may fail to maintain our existing property, plant and equipment, realize our capital investment strategies, meet our growth targets and successfully expand the rate base upon which we are able to earn future returns on our
investment and a return of our investment. Even if we have adequate resources to make required capital expenditures, we face the additional risk that we will not complete our major capital expenditures on time, as a result of construction delays or
other obstacles. Each of these outcomes could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We also face the risk that after we make substantial capital expenditures, the rate increases granted to us by state PUCs may not be
sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses and to allow us the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital.

The failure of, or the requirement to repair, upgrade or dismantle, any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

We own approximately 100 dams. A failure of any of those dams could result in injuries and property damage downstream for
which we may be liable. The failure of a dam would also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Any losses or liabilities
incurred due to a failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates.

We also are required from time to time to repair or upgrade the dams that we own. The cost of such repairs can be and has been material. We might not be
able to recover such costs through rates. The inability to recover these higher costs or regulatory lag in the recovery of such costs can affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.

The federal and state agencies that regulate our operations may adopt rules and regulations requiring us to dismantle our dams. Federal and state
agencies are currently considering rules and regulations that could require us to strengthen or dismantle one of our dams on the Carmel River in California due to safety concerns related to seismic activity. Any requirement to strengthen or
dismantle this dam could result in substantial costs that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are currently engaged in negotiations with federal and state agencies and local stakeholders on a plan to maintain
our existing Carmel River dams or to share the costs of dismantling one of them with those federal and state agencies and local stakeholders. These negotiations could be delayed or abandoned.

Any failure of our network of water and wastewater pipes and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and
reputation.

Our operating subsidiaries distribute water and wastewater through an extensive network of pipes and store water in
reservoirs located across the United States. A failure of major pipes or reservoirs could result in injuries and property damage for which we may be liable. The failure of major pipes and reservoirs may also result in the need to shut down some
facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs. Such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery requirements prescribed by
governmental regulators, including state PUCs with jurisdiction



over our operations, and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity and reputation. Any business interruption or
other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates.

Contamination of our sources of water could result in service interruptions and human exposure to hazardous substances and subject our subsidiaries
to civil or criminal enforcement actions, private litigation and cleanup obligations.

Our water supplies are subject to
contamination, including contamination from naturally-occurring compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems, pollution resulting from man-made sources, such as perchlorate and methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), and possible terrorist attacks. In
the event that our water supply is contaminated, we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the supply of water from another water source, including, in some cases, through the purchase of water from a
third-party supplier. In addition, we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities, or development of new treatment methods. If we are unable to substitute water supply
in a cost-effective manner, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity and reputation may be adversely affected. We might not be able to recover costs associated with treating or decontaminating water supplies through
rates, or such recovery may not occur in a timely manner. Moreover, we could be held liable for environmental damage as well as damages arising from toxic tort or other lawsuits or criminal enforcement actions or other consequences arising out of
human exposure to hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies.

Our liquidity and earnings could be adversely affected by increases in our
production costs, including the cost of chemicals, electricity, fuel or other significant materials used in the water and wastewater treatment process.

We incur significant production costs in connection with the delivery of our water and wastewater services. Our production costs are driven by inputs such as chemicals used to treat water and wastewater as well as
electricity and fuel, which are used to operate pumps and other equipment used in water treatment and delivery and wastewater collection, treatment and disposal. We also incur production costs for waste disposal. For 2008, production costs accounted
for 11.4% of our total operating costs. These costs can and do increase unexpectedly and in substantial amounts, as occurred in California during 2001 and Illinois during 2007, when the cost of electricity rose substantially.

Our Regulated Businesses might not be able to recover increases in the costs of chemicals, electricity, fuel, other significant inputs or waste disposal
through rates, or such recovery may not occur in a timely manner. Our Non-Regulated Businesses may not be able to recover these costs in contract prices or other terms. The inability to recover these higher costs can affect our financial condition,
results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.

Our reliance on third-party suppliers poses significant risks to our business and prospects.

We contract with third parties for goods and services that are essential to our operations, such as maintenance services, pipes,
chemicals, electricity, water, gasoline, diesel and other materials. We are subject to substantial risks because of our reliance on these suppliers. For example:

•

our suppliers may not provide raw materials that meet our specifications in sufficient quantities;

•

our suppliers may provide us with water that does not meet applicable quality standards or is contaminated;

•

our suppliers may face production delays due to natural disasters or strikes, lock-outs or other such actions;

•

one or more suppliers could make strategic changes in the lines of products and services they offer; and

•

some of our suppliers are small companies which are more likely to experience financial and operational difficulties than larger, well-established companies,
because of their limited financial and other resources.



As a result of any of these factors, we may be required to find alternative suppliers for the raw
materials and services on which we rely. Accordingly, we may experience delays in obtaining appropriate raw materials and services on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities from such alternative suppliers at a reasonable price, which could
interrupt services to our customers and adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.

Risks
associated with potential acquisitions or investments may adversely affect us.

We will continue to seek to acquire or invest in
additional regulated water or wastewater systems, including by acquiring systems in markets in the United States where we do not currently operate our Regulated Businesses, and through tuck-ins. We will also continue to seek to enter into
public/private partnerships, including O&M, military and design, build and operate, which we refer to as DBO, contracts and services that complement our businesses. These transactions may result in:

•

incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities;

•

failure to have or to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting;

•

fluctuations in quarterly results;

•

exposure to unknown risk and liabilities, such as environmental liabilities; and

•

other acquisition-related expenses.

We may also experience difficulty in obtaining required regulatory approvals for acquisitions, and any regulatory approvals we obtain may require us to agree to costly and restrictive conditions imposed by regulators. Sales of our common
stock by RWE, as well as the restrictions in the registration rights agreement between us and RWE, may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise additional equity to fund an acquisition or to issue shares as consideration in connection with
an acquisition. We may not identify all significant risks when conducting due diligence for a transaction, and we could be exposed to potential liabilities for which we will not be indemnified. There may be difficulties integrating new businesses,
including bringing newly acquired businesses up to the necessary level of regulatory compliance, retaining and integrating key personnel, achieving strategic objectives and integrating acquired assets and technological systems. The demands of
identifying and transitioning newly acquired businesses or pursuing investment opportunities may also divert management’s attention from other business concerns and otherwise disrupt our business. Any of these risks may adversely affect our
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill, and we may never realize the full
value of our intangible assets, causing us to record impairments that may negatively affect our results of operations or require us to effect additional dilutive equity issuances.

Our total assets include substantial goodwill. At December 31, 2008, our goodwill totaled $1,699.5 million. The goodwill is primarily associated with
the acquisition of American Water by an affiliate of RWE in 2003 and the acquisition of E’Town Corporation in 2001. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price the purchaser paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible
assets acquired. Goodwill is recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition and, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” or SFAS No. 142, is reviewed
annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Annual impairment reviews are performed at November 30 of each year and interim reviews are performed when management determines that a
triggering event has occurred. We have been required to reflect, as required by SFAS No. 142 and other applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating results for goodwill impairment in the amounts of $750.0 million, $509.3 million,
and $227.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These amounts include impairments relating to discontinued operations. As a result of these impairments, net income was reduced by $738.5 million, $501.5
million and $223.6 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.



The Company may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions
or other factors related to the Company’s performance. These market events could include a decline over a period of time of the Company’s stock price, a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities,
the lack of an increase in the Company’s market price consistent with its peer companies, or decreases in control premiums and the overhang effect. A decline in the forecasted results in our business plan, such as changes in rate case results
or capital investment budgets or changes in our interest rates, could also result in an impairment charge. Recognition of impairments of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect the Company’s reported results of operations and
total capitalization, the effect of which could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain its credit ratings, secure financing on attractive terms, maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet expectations of our regulators.

Our Regulated Businesses compete with governmental entities, other regulated utilities, as well as strategic and financial buyers, for acquisition
opportunities, which may hinder our ability to grow our business.

We compete with governmental entities, other regulated utilities,
as well as strategic and financial buyers, for acquisition opportunities, including tuck-ins. Our competitors may impede our growth by purchasing water utilities near our existing operations, thereby preventing us from acquiring them. Competing
governmental entities, utilities and strategic and financial buyers have challenged, and may in the future challenge, our applications for new service territories. Our growth could be hindered if we are not able to compete effectively for new
territories with other companies or strategic and financial buyers that have lower costs of operations or that can submit more attractive bids.

The
assets of our Regulated Businesses are subject to condemnation through eminent domain.

Municipalities and other government
subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the United States, and organized movements may arise from time to time in one or more of the service areas in which our Regulated Businesses operate to
convert our assets to public ownership and operation through the governmental power of eminent domain. Should a municipality or other government subdivision seek to acquire our assets through eminent domain, we may resist the acquisition. Contesting
an exercise of condemnation through eminent domain may result in costly legal proceedings and may divert the attention of the affected Regulated Business’s management from the operation of its business.

On September 5, 2008, under threat of condemnation, California American Water sold the assets of our Felton, California water system, which served
approximately 1,330 customers, to the San Lorenzo Valley Water District, which we refer to as SLVWD. The most recent prior sale of our water and wastewater systems under threat of condemnation occurred in 2003. If a municipality or other government
subdivision succeeds in acquiring the assets of one or more of our Regulated Businesses through eminent domain, there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the business, that we will not be able to keep the compensation, or
that we will not be able to divest the business without incurring significant one-time charges.

In order to consummate the proposed RWE Divestiture,
we and RWE were required to obtain approvals from thirteen state PUCs. There can be no guarantee that some state PUC approvals already granted to us will not be appealed, withdrawn, modified or stayed.

To consummate the proposed RWE Divestiture, we and RWE obtained regulatory approvals from state PUCs in 13 states. The state PUC approval in Illinois has
been appealed, and there can be no guarantee that the state PUC approval in Illinois will not be overturned. Moreover, some of our existing state PUC approvals may be withdrawn or altered in the future by the state PUCs because they retain authority
to withdraw or modify their prior decisions. There also can be no guarantee that, in conjunction with an appeal or otherwise, a stay or other form of injunctive relief will not be granted by a state PUC or reviewing court.

In addition, two of the regulatory approvals that we and RWE obtained expire on April 22, 2010 and another approval expires on April 22, 2011.
If RWE does not fully divest its remaining ownership of American Water by



such dates, then we and RWE may be required to seek an extension of such approvals, as applicable, which process may result in delays, costs and the
imposition of additional conditions on us or on RWE.

In order to obtain the state PUC approvals to consummate the proposed RWE Divestiture we were
required to accept certain conditions and restrictions that could increase our costs.

Some of the regulatory approvals contain
conditions and restrictions, including reporting obligations, obligations to maintain appropriate creditworthiness, restrictions on changes of control, prohibitions on the pass- through of our initial Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance costs,
prohibitions on the pass-through of certain costs of the initial public offering and related transactions, service quality and staffing level requirements and the maintenance of specific collective bargaining agreements and retirement and certain
other post-employment benefit programs. These conditions and restrictions could increase our costs and adversely affect our business.

Our
Non-Regulated Businesses, through American Water (excluding our regulated subsidiaries), provide performance guarantees and other forms of financial security to our public-sector clients that could be claimed by our clients or potential clients if
we do not meet certain obligations.

Under the terms of some of our indebtedness and some of our agreements for the provision of
services to water and wastewater facilities with municipalities, other governmental entities and other customers, American Water (excluding its regulated subsidiaries) provides guarantees of the performance of our Non-Regulated Businesses, including
financial guarantees or deposits, to ensure performance of certain obligations. At December 31, 2008, we had remaining performance commitments as measured by remaining contract revenue totaling approximately $2,288.8 million, and this amount is
likely to increase if our Non-Regulated Businesses grow. The presence of these commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to secure financing on attractive terms. In addition, if the obligor on the
instrument fails to perform certain obligations to the satisfaction of the party that holds the performance commitments that party may seek to enforce the performance commitments against us or proceed against the deposit. In that event, our
financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity could be adversely affected.

We operate a number of water and wastewater systems
under O&M contracts and face the risk that the owners of those systems may fail to maintain those systems, which will negatively affect us as the operators of the systems.

We operate a number of water and wastewater systems under O&M contracts. Pursuant to these contracts, we operate the system according to the standards
set forth in the applicable contract, and it is generally the responsibility of the owner to undertake capital improvements. In some cases, we may not be able to convince the owner to make needed improvements in order to maintain compliance with
applicable regulations. Although violations and fines incurred by water and wastewater systems may be the responsibility of the owner of the system under these contracts, those non-compliance events may reflect poorly on us as the operator of the
system and damage our reputation, and in some cases, may result in liability to the same extent as if we were the owner.

Our Non-Regulated
Businesses are party to long-term contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems under which we may incur costs in excess of payments received.

Some of our Non-Regulated Businesses enter into long-term contracts pursuant to which they agree to operate and maintain a municipality’s, Federal government’s or other party’s water or wastewater
treatment and delivery facilities, which includes responsibility for certain major maintenance for some of those facilities, in exchange for an annual fee. Our Non-Regulated Businesses are generally subject to the risk that costs associated with
operating and maintaining the facilities may exceed the fees received from the municipality or other contracting party. In addition, directly or through our non-regulated subsidiaries, we often guarantee our Non-Regulated Businesses’
obligations under those contracts. Losses under these contracts or guarantees may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.



We rely on our IT systems to assist with the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships,
and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business.

Our IT systems are an integral part of our business, and a
serious disruption of our IT systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently, which in turn could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and cause our results of operations to be reduced.
We depend on our IT systems to bill customers, process orders, provide customer service, manage construction projects, manage our financial records, track assets, remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources,
inventory and accounts receivable collections. Our IT systems also allow us to purchase products from our suppliers and bill customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations and provide service to our customers. Our IT systems are
vulnerable to damage or interruption from:

•

power loss, computer systems failures and internet, telecommunications or data network failures;

•

operator negligence or improper operation by, or supervision of, employees;

•

physical and electronic loss of customer data or security breaches, misappropriation and similar events;

•

computer viruses;

•

intentional acts of vandalism and similar events; and

•

hurricanes, fires, floods, earthquakes and other natural disasters.

Such damages or interruptions may result in physical and electronic loss of customer or financial data, security breaches, misappropriation and similar events. In addition, the lack of redundancy for certain of our IT
systems, including billing systems, could exacerbate the impact on the Company of any of the foregoing events.

In addition, we may not be
successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business and we might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of our outdated existing technology to allow us to
continue to operate at our current level of efficiency.

Our indebtedness could affect our business adversely and limit our ability to plan for or
respond to changes in our business, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our liquidity needs.

As of
December 31, 2008, our indebtedness (including preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements) was $5,303.0 million, and our working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, was in a deficit position. Our
indebtedness could have important consequences, including:

•

limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital or capital expenditures;

•

exposing us to interest rate risk with respect to the portion of our indebtedness that bears interest at a variable rate;

•

limiting our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or make payments in connection with our other obligations;

•

likely requiring that a portion of our cash flow from operations be dedicated to the payment of the principal of and interest on our debt, thereby reducing funds
available for future operations, acquisitions, dividends on our common stock or capital expenditures;

•

limiting our ability to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market or industry
conditions; and

•

placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that have less debt.

In order to meet our capital expenditure needs, we may be required to make additional borrowings under our credit facilities or be required to issue new
debt securities in the capital markets. We can provide no assurances that we will be able to access the debt capital markets or do so on favorable terms. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks we now face could intensify,
limiting our ability to refinance existing debt on favorable terms.

We will depend primarily on operations to fund our expenses and to pay
the principal and interest on our outstanding debt. Our ability to meet our expenses thus depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our



control. If we do not have enough money to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our
existing debt, sell assets, borrow additional funds or sell additional equity. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, we
may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business that would prevent us from maintaining or increasing our business and cause our operating results and prospects to be affected adversely.

Our failure to comply with restrictive covenants under our credit facilities could trigger prepayment obligations.

Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants under our credit facilities could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could
result in us being required to repay or refinance (on less favorable terms) these borrowings before their due date. If we are forced to repay or refinance (on less favorable terms) these borrowings, our results of operations and financial condition
could be adversely affected by increased costs and rates. In 2007, we were not in compliance with reporting covenants contained in some of the debt agreements of our subsidiaries. Such defaults under the reporting covenants were caused by our delay
in producing our 2006 quarterly and audited annual consolidated financial statements. We have obtained all necessary waivers under the agreements. We can provide no assurance that we will comply in the future with all our reporting covenants and
will not face an event of default under our debt agreements, or that such default will be cured or waived.

Work stoppages and other labor relations
matters could adversely affect our results of operations.

Currently, approximately 3,700 of our employees, or approximately 51% of
our total workforce, are unionized and represented by 20 different unions. Approximately one-fourth of our 76 union collective bargaining agreements expire annually, with 18 agreements covering 982 employees scheduled to expire before the end of
2009. We might not be able to renegotiate labor contracts on terms that are favorable to us and negotiations or dispute resolutions undertaken in connection with our labor contracts could be delayed or become subject to the risk of labor actions or
work stoppages. Labor actions, work stoppages or the threat of work stoppages and our failure to obtain favorable labor contract terms during renegotiations may all adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and
liquidity.

Material weaknesses in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting existed during 2008. If we fail to maintain
effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or on a timely basis. Any inability to report and file our financial results in an accurate and timely manner could harm our business
and adversely impact the trading price of our common stock.

As a public company, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act and other rules and regulations that govern public companies. In particular, we will be required to certify our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2009, which requires us to perform
system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. However, from 2003 until the completion of our initial public offering in April 2008, we were an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of RWE, a
stock corporation incorporated in the Federal Republic of Germany, and were not required to maintain a system of effective internal controls or comply with the requirements of the SEC and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, nor to prepare our own consolidated
financial statements. As a public reporting company, we are required, among other things, to maintain a system of effective internal control over financial reporting suitable to prepare our publicly reported financial statements in a timely and
accurate manner, and also to evaluate and report on such system of internal control.



A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial
reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In connection with the preparation of our
consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006, we and our independent registered public accountants identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting:

•

inadequate internal staffing and skills;

•

inadequate controls over financial reporting processes;

•

inadequate controls over month-end closing processes, including account reconciliations;

•

inadequate controls over maintenance of contracts and agreements;

•

inadequate controls over segregation of duties and restriction of access to key accounting applications; and

•

inadequate controls over tax accounting and accruals.

Each of these weaknesses could have resulted in a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2008, we consider the control deficiency relating to the
maintenance of contracts and agreements should remain as a material weakness until we have sufficient experience with the sustainability of the levels at which it has been operating. This weakness could result in a material misstatement of our
annual or interim consolidated financial statements. For further discussion, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Our Internal Control and Remediation Initiatives.” Moreover,
we cannot assure you that we have identified all, or that we will not in the future have additional, material weaknesses, any of which may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, and cause future delays in filing our financial statements and
periodic reports with the SEC. Any such delays in the filing of our financial statements and periodic reports may result in a loss of public confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and sanctions imposed on us by the SEC. We believe
that such misstatements or delays could negatively impact our liquidity, access to capital markets, financial condition and the market value of our common stock or cause a downgrade in the credit ratings of American Water or AWCC.

PROPERTIES

Our properties consist of transmission
and distribution mains and conduits, water and wastewater treatment plants, pumping wells, tanks, meters, supply lines, dams reservoirs, buildings, vehicles, land, easements, rights software and other facilities and equipment used for the operation
of our systems, including the collection, treatment, storage and distribution of water and the collection and treatment of wastewater. Substantially all of our properties are owned by our subsidiaries, and a substantial portion our property is
subject to liens of our mortgage bonds. Our regulated subsidiaries own, in the states in which they operate, transmission and distribution mains, pump stations, treatment plants, storage tanks, reservoirs and related facilities. A substantial
acreage of land is owned by our Regulated Businesses, the greater part of which is located in watershed areas, with the balance being principally sites of pumping and treatment plants, storage reservoirs, tanks and standpipes.
Our Non-Regulated Businesses’ properties consist mainly of spreading and waste transportation equipment,             office
vehicles and furniture and are primarily located in New Jersey and Canada. Approximately 50% of our properties are located in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. We lease our corporate offices, equipment and furniture, located in Voorhees, New Jersey from
one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. These properties are utilized by our directors, officers and staff in the conduct of the business.



We maintain property insurance against loss or damage to our properties by fire or other perils, subject
to certain exceptions. For insured losses, we are self-insured to the extent that any losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial condition or results of operations.

We believe that our properties are generally maintained in good operating condition and in accordance with
current standards of good water and wastewater works industry practice and units of property are replaced as and when necessary.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In 2001, CAWC, entered into a
conservation agreement with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which we refer to as NOAA, requiring CAWC to implement certain measures to protect the steelhead trout and its habitat in the Carmel River watershed, study the removal
of the San Clemente Dam and explore long-term water sources other than a new reservoir in the Carmel River. Since that time, CAWC has implemented a number of measures to reduce the impact of its operations on the steelhead trout and other species
and has begun the environmental review and permitting process for our Coastal Water Project, which is intended to provide an alternate water source for the Monterey Peninsula and, in part, to address some of the foregoing concerns relating to
withdrawals from Carmel River. In early 2004, NOAA informed CAWC of its concern that CAWC’s ongoing operations would cause the “take” of significant numbers of steelhead trout during the several remaining years required to implement
the Coastal Water Project. In June 2006, CAWC and NOAA entered a settlement agreement whereby CAWC agreed to fund certain additional projects to improve habitat conditions for and aid in the recovery of steelhead trout in the Carmel River watershed.
Under the settlement agreement, CAWC is required, among other things, to make an initial payment of $3.5 million plus six annual installments of $1.1 million. The settlement agreement requires that all payments made by CAWC to NOAA be used for
mitigation projects in the Carmel River watershed. Although we established a reserve for settlement payments, no payments have been made to date because NOAA had been unable to ensure that settlement payments will be used for mitigation projects in
the Carmel River watershed. NOAA has agreed not to assess any penalties or otherwise prosecute CAWC for any “take” of steelhead trout, so long as CAWC complies with the settlement agreement. In January 2009, the Company and NOAA agreed in
principle to amend the settlement agreement to allow the required payments to be made to and managed by a California state agency under an existing mitigation program. Pending finalization of this amendment, including agreement by the state agency,
the Company expects to make its first payment of $3.5 million on April 1, 2009. On March 14, 2008, the Sierra Club and the Carmel River Steelhead Association notified CAWC of their intent to file a citizen suit, 60 days therefrom, for
violations of the federal Endangered Species Act alleging the “take” of steelhead trout by CAWC along the Carmel River and seeking injunctive relief to reduce river water diversions and increase river flow and fish passage facilities. No
such suit was filed, however, the Sierra Club and the Carmel River Steelhead Association recently filed an administrative complaint with the California State Water Resources Control Board claiming that certain fish passage facilities do not meet
existing permit requirements. CAWC also undertakes activities to protect the threatened California red-legged frog and its habitat in the Carmel River pursuant to a prior agreement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“USFWS”). This
agreement is currently expired, and CAWC is in discussions with USFWS to renew the agreement. In addition, the State Water Resource Control Board recently has held administrative hearings to address claims that CAWC has exceeded its water diversion
rights in the Carmel River and has not diligently pursued establishing an alternative water supply as required by an administrative order issued to CAWC by the State Water Resource Control Board in 1995. A decision in this matter is pending.
Although CAWC believes it has continued to comply with its obligations under the State Water Resource Board’s 1995 order, as well as the settlement agreement and CAWC’s permit requirements, we can not assure you that any future
requirements by the State Water Resources Control Board arising from the matters currently before it or other permit modifications would not result in material additional costs or obligations to us.

In February 2004, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, which we refer to as NJDEP, issued to NJAWC, a notice of violation alleging that
NJAWC had exceeded annual diversion limits contained in NJAW’s water allocation permits for certain wells in our Lakewood system during the years 2001 through 2003.



NJDEP initially assessed a penalty of $0.6 million. NJAWC subsequently submitted a voluntary statewide Self Disclosure Report identifying all such
exceedances for the period of 1999 through 2003. In December 2007, NJAWC finalized an administrative consent order with NJDEP to resolve the above violations under which NJAWC has paid a civil fine of $0.1 million and has undertaken a $0.4 million
environmental project, which we currently expect to complete by the end of 2009. We have established a reserve for the project costs, and we believe that NJAWC is operating in compliance with the applicable diversion limits in its water allocation
permits.

CAWC, NJAWC and Long Island Water Corporation are each plaintiffs in lawsuits relating to contamination by methyl tertiary butyl
ether, which we refer to as MTBE, and other gasoline additives, in which they seek to recover cleanup and treatment costs and to protect certain of their groundwater supplies. The defendants in these cases are oil and chemical companies that
manufacture MTBE, refine gasoline containing MTBE, and/or supply gasoline containing MTBE to retail gasoline stations. The cases were consolidated with cases involving other plaintiffs in multidistrict litigation pending in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (

In Re: Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether Products Liability Litigation

, Case No. MDL 1358 SAS). As a result of court-ordered mediation, CAWC, NJAWC, Long Island Water Corporation and the other
plaintiffs agreed to settle the lawsuits with some of the named defendants, who represent a significant portion of the total national refining capacity for MTBE. Under the settlement, which was approved by the court in August 2008, CAWC, NJAWC and
Long Island Water Corporation received payments, after deducting attorneys’ fees and litigation expenses, totaling approximately $15.4 million in the aggregate to treat wells that were contaminated by MTBE at the time of the settlement. The
settling defendants are obligated to pay a significant share of treatment costs for any wells that become contaminated by MTBE above certain concentration levels over the next 30 years. CAWC, NJAWC and Long Island Water Corporation expect to
continue to litigate their claims against other, remaining defendants. Although we do not currently expect pending and future treatment costs for MTBE contamination to be material, there can be no guarantee that CAWC, NJAWC or Long Island Water
Corporation will be able to recover all of their respective costs relating to any past or future discovery of MTBE in their wells from any of the settling defendants, by means of any pending or future litigation, or through their rate cases.

Terratec, our Canadian subsidiary, is subject to and has been complying with an Order by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, which we
refer to as MOE, issued on October 31, 2006 requiring it to take steps to thicken certain biosolids that had been more susceptible to spillage during transport. MOE conducted an investigation and laid charges against Terratec relating to four
such transport spillage incidents involving Terratec that occurred prior to the issuance of the Order. In December 2008, Terratec and the MOE agreed that Terratec would pay a fine of Cdn $300,000 plus a 25% surcharge to resolve these charges.

Periodically, we are involved in other proceedings or litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that the
ultimate resolution of these matters will materially affect our financial position or results of operations.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations covers periods prior to the consummation of our initial
public offering and related transactions. Accordingly, the discussion and analysis of historical periods before our initial public offering and related transactions do not reflect the significant impact that these transactions have had or will have
on us. You should read the following discussion together with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current
expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. The cautionary statements made in this Form 10-K should be read as applying to all related forward-looking statements whenever they appear in this Form 10-K. Our actual
results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those we discuss under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. You should
read “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements.” Certain 2007 and 2006 amounts have been reclassified within operations and maintenance expense to conform to the 2008 presentation.

Overview

Founded in 1886, American Water is the
largest investor-owned United States water and wastewater utility company, as measured both by operating revenue and population served. Our approximately 7,300 employees provide drinking water, wastewater and other water-related services to more
than 15 million people in 32 states and Ontario, Canada. In 2008, we generated $2,336.9 million in total operating revenue, representing approximately four times the operating revenue of the next largest investor-owned company in the United
States water and wastewater business, and $186.9 million in operating loss, which includes $750.0 million of impairment charges relating to continuing operations, and a net loss of $562.4 million.

Our primary business involves the ownership of water and wastewater utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential, commercial and
industrial customers. Our Regulated Businesses that provide these services are generally subject to economic regulation by state PUCs in the states in which they operate. The federal government and the states also regulate environmental, health and
safety and water quality matters. Our Regulated Businesses currently provide services in 20 states and in 2008 served approximately 3.3 million customers, or connections to our water and wastewater networks. We report the results of this
business in our Regulated Businesses segment. For the year ended December 31, 2008 Regulated Businesses generated $2,082.7 million in operating revenue, prior to inter-segment eliminations, representing 89.1% of our consolidated operating
revenue.

We also provide services that are not subject to economic regulation by state PUCs. Our Non-Regulated Businesses include our:

•

Contract Operations Group, which enters into public/private partnerships, including O&M and DBO contracts for the provision of services to water and wastewater
facilities for municipalities, the United States military and other customers;

•

Applied Water Management Group, which works with customers to design, build and operate small water and wastewater treatment plants; and

•

Homeowner Services Group, which provides services to domestic homeowners to protect against the cost of repairing broken or leaking pipes inside and outside their
homes.

We report these results in our Non-Regulated Businesses segment. For the year ended December 31, 2008, our
Non-Regulated Businesses generated $272.2 million in operating revenue, prior to inter-segment eliminations.



History

Prior to being acquired by RWE in 2003, we were the largest publicly traded water utility company as measured by both operating revenue and population served in the United States. In 2003, we were acquired by RWE and became a private
company. Prior to the Merger, Thames US Holdings, formerly an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of RWE, was the holding company for us and our regulated and unregulated subsidiaries throughout the United States and Ontario, Canada. The RWE
acquisition resulted in certain changes in our business. For example, our operations and management were managed through Thames Water.

Our
consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflects expense allocations for some central corporate functions historically provided to us by Thames Water, including information systems, human resources, accounting
and treasury activities and legal services. These allocations reflect expenses specifically identifiable as relating to our business as well as our share of expenses allocated to us based on capital employed, capital expenditures, headcount,
revenues, production volumes, fixed costs, environmental accruals or other methods management considers to be reasonable. During our transition to a separate, stand-alone company, we have developed or obtained additional in-house capabilities
related to these functions, and therefore there were no such expense allocations in 2008 or in 2007 from RWE or its affiliates. We and RWE consider these allocations to be a reasonable reflection of our utilization of the services provided by Thames
Water. However, our expenses as a separate, stand-alone company may be higher or lower than the amounts reflected in our 2006 consolidated statements of operations. Also, we agreed not to file rate cases with some state PUCs for specified periods of
time as a condition of the acquisition. As of December 31, 2007, all rate stay-out provisions associated with the RWE acquisition had expired.

In 2005, RWE decided to divest American Water. In March 2006, RWE decided to divest American Water through the sale of shares in one or more public offerings. In order to become a public company once again, we have had to incur substantial
initial costs, including costs associated with ensuring adequate internal control over financial reporting in order to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. These substantial initial costs will not be recovered in rates charged to our
customers. See “—Our Internal Control and Remediation Initiatives.”

Upon the completion of our initial public offering in
April 2008, we again became listed on the NYSE. RWE Aqua Holdings GmbH, the selling stockholder, sold approximately 63.2 million shares of the Company’s common stock. RWE currently owns approximately 60% of the Company’s shares of
common stock.

We performed valuations of our goodwill in 2008, 2007 and 2006. As a result of the valuation analyses, we recorded pre-tax
charges of $750.0 million, $509.3 million and $227.8 million, including impairment charges from discontinued operations, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Our Internal Control and Remediation Initiatives

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. However, from 2003 to April 28, 2008, we were an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of RWE
and, as a privately owned company, were not required to comply with the requirements of the SEC and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or to prepare our own consolidated financial statements. As a public reporting company, we are required, among other things,
to maintain a system of effective internal control over financial reporting suitable to prepare our publicly reported financial statements in a timely and accurate manner, and also to evaluate and report on such system of internal control. In
particular, we are required to certify our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2009, which will require us to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over
financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.



In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006,
we and our independent registered public accountants identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting:

•

Inadequate internal staffing and skills;

•

Inadequate controls over financial reporting processes;

•

Inadequate controls over month-end closing processes, including account reconciliations;

•

Inadequate controls over maintenance of contracts and agreements;

•

Inadequate controls over segregation of duties and restriction of access to key accounting applications; and

•

Inadequate controls over tax accounting and accruals.

Since joining the Company in 2006, Donald L. Correll, our Chief Executive Officer, and Ellen C. Wolf, our Chief Financial Officer, have assigned a high priority to the evaluation and remediation of our internal
controls, and have taken numerous steps to enhance these internal controls to a level that would prevent or detect a material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements and to implement an ongoing process to evaluate and strengthen our
overall internal controls over financial reporting. Some of the actions taken to remediate these material weaknesses and to evaluate and strengthen our other internal controls over financial reporting include:

•

Increasing our internal financial staff numbers and skill levels, and using external resources to supplement our internal staff when necessary;

•

Implementing detailed processes and procedures related to our period-end financial closing processes, key accounting applications and our financial reporting
processes;

•

Implementing or enhancing systems used in the financial reporting processes and month-end close processes;

•

Conducting extensive training on existing and newly developed processes and procedures as well as explaining to employees Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements and the
value of internal controls;

•

Enhancing our internal audit staff;

•

Hiring a director of internal control and a director of taxes during 2007;

•

Implementing a tracking mechanism and new policy and procedure for approval of all contracts and agreements; and

•

Retaining a nationally recognized accounting and auditing firm to assist management in developing policies and procedures surrounding internal controls over
financial reporting, to evaluate and test these internal controls and to assist in the remediation of internal control deficiencies.

With respect to the material weaknesses described above, we believe that we have addressed the areas of material weakness, and have tested the effectiveness of controls designed to address these material weaknesses.
Based on these actions and the length of time these controls have been operating at a level that would prevent or detect a material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements, we no longer consider these control deficiencies to be
material weaknesses as of December 31, 2008, except for the control deficiencies relating to the maintenance of contracts and agreements, which in our opinion should remain as a material weakness until we have sufficient experience with the
sustainability of the levels at which it has been operating.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had incurred $58.4 million to
remediate these material weaknesses and to document and test key financial reporting controls. At this time, the Company cannot indicate with certainty what additional costs may need to be incurred in the future. As a condition to state PUC approval
of the RWE Divestiture, we agreed that costs incurred in connection with our initial internal control and remediation initiatives would not be recoverable in rates charged to our customers.



Elements of our remediation activities can only be accomplished over time, and our initiatives provide no
assurances that they will result in an effective internal control environment. Our board of directors, in coordination with our audit committee, will continually assess the progress and sufficiency of these initiatives and make adjustments, as
necessary.

The Company believes the additional control procedures as designed, when implemented, will fully remediate the material
weaknesses described above.

Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations

As the largest investor-owned United States water and wastewater utility company, as measured both by operating revenue and population served, our
financial condition and results of operations are influenced by a variety of industry-wide factors, including the following:

•

economic utility regulation;

•

the need for infrastructure investment;

•

compliance with environmental, health and safety standards;

•

production costs;

•

customer growth;

•

an overall trend of declining water usage per customer;

•

weather and seasonality and;

•

economic environment.

Since our
acquisition by RWE in 2003, our results of operations have also been significantly influenced by goodwill impairments. See “Goodwill Impairment”.

Factors that may affect the results of operations of our Regulated Businesses’ operating performance are mitigated by state PUCs granting us appropriate rate relief that is designed to allow us to recover
prudently incurred expenses and to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment.

Economic Utility Regulation

Our subsidiaries in the states in which we operate our Regulated Businesses are generally subject to extensive economic regulation by their respective
state PUCs. Although specific authority might differ from state to state, in most states, these state PUCs must approve rates, accounting treatments, long-term financing programs, significant capital expenditures and plant additions, transactions
between the regulated subsidiary and affiliated entities, reorganizations and mergers and acquisitions, in many instances prior to their completion. Regulatory policies not only vary from state to state, they may change over time. These policies
will affect the timing as well as the extent of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital.

Our operating revenue is
typically determined by reference to the volume of water supplied to a customer multiplied by a price-per-gallon set by a tariff approved by the relevant state PUC. The process to obtain approval for a change in rates, or rate case, involves filing
a petition with the state PUC on a periodic basis as determined by our capital expenditures needs and our operating costs. Rate cases and other rate-related proceedings can take several months to a year or more to complete. Therefore, there is
frequently a delay, or regulatory lag, between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operating expense increase and when those costs are reflected in rates. The management team at each of our regulated
subsidiaries works to minimize regulatory lag.

Our results of operations are significantly affected by rates authorized by the state PUCs
in the states in which we operate, and we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with rate stay-outs and delayed or



inadequate rate recovery. In addition to general rate case filings, we generate revenues through other cost recovery procedures. For example, some states in
which we operate allow utility subsidiaries to recover system infrastructure replacement costs without the necessity of filing a full rate proceeding. Since infrastructure replacement is a significant element of capital expenditures made by our
subsidiaries, such programs can reduce regulatory lag.

Currently, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Missouri, Indiana, New York, California and Ohio
have allowed the use of these infrastructure surcharges. These surcharges adjust periodically based on qualified capital expenditures being completed or anticipated in a future period. These surcharges are typically reset to zero when new base rates
are effective and incorporate the costs of these infrastructure expenditures. In 2008, we have been granted an additional $18.0 million in revenues, assuming constant sales volumes from such surcharges in several of our states. Furthermore, we were
granted a $0.6 million increase for an arsenic surcharge in our Arizona subsidiary, allowing recovery for costs associated with the construction and operation of arsenic treatment facilities.

Also, some of the states in which we operate permit pass-through provisions that allow for an increase in certain operating costs, such as purchased
power and property taxes, to be passed on to and recovered from the customers outside of a general rate proceeding.

Some states have
permitted use of some form of forecast or forward-looking test year instead of historical data to set rates. Examples of these states include Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Tennessee and California. In addition, a number
of states in which we operate have allowed the utility to update historical data for some changes that occur for some limited period of time subsequent to the historical test year. This allows the utility to take account of some more current costs
or capital investments in the rate-setting process. Examples of these states include New Mexico, Texas, Missouri, Iowa, Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, New Jersey and Arizona.

Another regulatory mechanism to address issues of regulatory lag includes the ability, in some circumstances, to recover in rates a return on utility
plant before it is actually in service, instead of capitalizing an allowance for funds used during construction. Examples of states that have allowed such recovery include Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, Virginia and California.

The infrastructure surcharge, pass-through provisions, the forward-looking test year and the allowance of a return on utility plant before it is actually
in service are examples of mechanisms that present an opportunity to limit the risks associated with regulatory lag. We employ each of these mechanisms as part of our rate case management program to ensure efficient recovery of our costs and
investment and to ensure positive short-term liquidity and long-term profitability.

In addition, some states have permitted us to seek
pre-approval of certain capital projects and associated costs. In this pre-approval process, the PUCs assess the prudency of such projects.

As a condition to our acquisition by RWE in 2003, we agreed not to file rate cases in some of the states where our Regulated Businesses operate. In 2008 we received authorizations for additional annualized revenues from general rate cases
of $187.7 million. We are awaiting the final order for our Hawaii general rate case that was filed in 2007, requesting $1.3 million in total additional annual revenues. In October 2008, The Hawaii Public Utility Commission approved on an
interim basis an increase in additional annualized revenues of $0.7 million. The interim rates were effective for the fourth quarter of 2008. Also, at this time, we are awaiting final orders in six states, for general rate cases filed in 2008,
requesting additional annualized revenues of $102.7 million. There is no assurance that the filed amount, or any portion thereof, of any requested increases will be granted.

Infrastructure Investment

The water
and wastewater utility industry is highly capital intensive. We invested approximately $1 billion and $750 million in net Company-funded capital improvements in 2008 and 2007, respectively. From 2009 to



2013, we estimate that Company-funded capital investment will total between $4.0 billion and $4.5 billion. We anticipate spending between $790 million and
$1.0 billion yearly on Company-funded capital investment for the foreseeable future, depending upon the timing of major capital projects. Our capital investment includes both infrastructure renewal programs, where we replace existing infrastructure,
as needed, and construction of new facilities to meet customer growth. From 2009 to 2013, we estimate we will invest approximately $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion to replace aging infrastructure including mains, meters, and supply and treatment
facilities. We estimate that we will invest approximately $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in new facilities to serve customer growth over this same period. In addition, we estimate that complying with water quality standards and other regulatory
requirements will require approximately $300 million to $400 million of investment. Projects to enhance system reliability, quality of service and risk reduction are estimated to require an investment of approximately $800 million while efficiency
related projects are estimated to require an investment of approximately $400 million to $600 million over this same period.

These capital
investments are needed on an ongoing basis to comply with existing and new regulations, renew aging treatment and network assets, provide capacity for new growth and enhance system reliability, security and quality of service. The need for
continuous investment presents a challenge due to the potential for regulatory lag, or the delay in recovering our operating expenses and earning an appropriate rate of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital. Because the
decisions of state PUCs and the timing of those decisions can have a significant impact on the operations and earnings of our Regulated Businesses, we maintain a rate case management program guided by the goals of obtaining efficient recovery of
costs of capital and utility operation and maintenance costs, including costs incurred for compliance with environmental, health and safety and water quality regulation. As discussed above under “—Economic Utility Regulation,” we
pursue methods to minimize the adverse impact of regulatory lag and have worked with state PUCs and legislatures to implement a number of approaches to achieve this result, including promoting the implementation of forms of forward-looking test
years and infrastructure surcharges.

Compliance with Environmental, Health and Safety Standards

Our water and wastewater operations are subject to extensive United States federal, state and local and, in the case of our Canadian operations, Canadian
laws and regulations, governing the protection of the environment, health and safety, the quality of the water we deliver to our customers, water allocation rights, and the manner in which we collect, treat, discharge and dispose of wastewater.
These requirements include the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Water Act and similar state and Canadian laws and regulations. We are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations. State PUCs
also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver. We incur substantial costs associated with compliance with environmental, health and safety and water quality regulation to which our Regulated Businesses are
subject.

Environmental, health and safety and water quality regulations are complex and change frequently, and the overall trend has been
that they have become more stringent over time. We face the risk that as newer or stricter standards are introduced, they could increase our operating expenses. In the past, we have generally been able to recover expenses associated with compliance
for environmental, health and safety standards, but this recovery is affected by regulatory lag and the corresponding uncertainties surrounding rate recovery.

Production Costs

Our water and wastewater services require significant production inputs and result in significant
production costs. These costs include fuel and power, which is used to operate pumps and other equipment, purchased water and chemicals used to treat water and wastewater. We also incur production costs for waste disposal. For 2008, production costs
accounted for approximately 11.4% of our total operating costs. Price increases associated with these inputs impact our results of operations until rate relief is granted.



Customer Growth

Customer growth in our Regulated Businesses is driven by (i) organic population growth within our authorized service areas and (ii) by adding new customers to our regulated customer base by acquiring water
and wastewater utility systems through acquisitions. Generally, we add customers through tuck-ins of small water and/or wastewater systems, typically serving fewer than 10,000 customers, in close geographic proximity to where we currently operate
our Regulated Businesses. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, we had cash outflows of $12.5 million, $15.9 million and $12.5 million, respectively, for tuck-in acquisitions of water and wastewater systems which allowed us to expand our regulated customer
base. We also seek larger acquisitions that allow us to acquire multiple water and wastewater utility systems in our existing markets and markets where we currently do not operate our Regulated Businesses. Our experienced development team evaluates
potential acquisition targets across the country, particularly in higher-growth areas. Before entering new markets, we will evaluate the regulatory environment to ensure that we will have the opportunity to achieve an appropriate return on our
investment while maintaining our high standards for quality, reliability and compliance with environmental, health and safety and water quality standards. These acquisitions may include large acquisitions of companies that have operations in
multiple markets. For further information, see “Business—Growth.”

Declining Water Usage Per Customer

Increased water conservation, including through the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential consumers, combined with
declining household sizes in the United States, has contributed to a trend of declining water usage per residential customer. Additionally, in the current economic environment, both industrial and commercial usage continues to decline.

The average annual decrease in residential water usage per customer from January 1999 through December 2008 (as a percentage of January 1999 usage) in
the larger states served by our Regulated Businesses ranged from a decline 0.56% per year in New Jersey at the low end to as high as 1.62% per year in West Virginia. The decline in industrial and commercial usage from 2007 to 2008 was
3.7%.

Because the characteristics of residential water use are driven by many factors, including socio-economic and other demographic
characteristics of our service areas, climate, seasonal weather patterns and water rates, these declining trends vary by state and service area and change over time. The trend of declining residential water usage per customer is higher in the
predominantly rural states served by our Regulated Businesses. We do not believe that the trend in any particular state or region will have a disproportionate impact on our results of operations.

Our Regulated Businesses are heavily dependent upon operating revenue generated from rates we charge to our customers for the volume of water they use.
Declining usage due to conservation or economic environment will have a negative impact on our long-term operating revenues if we are unable to secure appropriate regulatory treatment to offset the usage decline.

Water Supply

Our ability to meet the existing and
future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate supply of water. Drought, governmental restrictions, overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats or other factors may limit the availability of ground and
surface water. Also, customer usage of water is affected by weather conditions, in particular during the summer. Our water systems experience higher demand in the summer due to the warmer temperatures and increased usage by customers for lawn
irrigation and other outdoor uses. Summer weather that is cooler and wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand, and can have a downward effect on our operating revenue and operating income. Conversely, when weather
conditions are extremely dry and even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers, our systems may be affected by drought-related warnings and/or water usage restrictions imposed by governmental agencies, purchase supply allocation
and mandatory conservation measures. All of the above conditions serve to reduce customer demand and operating revenues. These restrictions may be imposed at a regional or state level



and may affect our service areas regardless of our readiness to meet unrestricted customer demands. We employ a variety of measures to ensure that we have
adequate sources of water supply, both in the short-term and over the long-term. For additional detail concerning these measures, see “Business—Our Regulated Businesses—Overview of Networks, Facilities and Water Supply.”

The geographic diversity of our service areas tends to mitigate some of the effect of weather extremes. In any given summer, some areas
are likely to experience drier than average weather while other areas will experience wetter than average weather.

Goodwill Impairment

At December 31, 2008, the Company’s goodwill totaled $1,699.5 million. The Company’s annual impairment reviews are performed as of
November 30 of each year, in conjunction with the timing of the completion of the Company’s annual strategic business plan. The Company also undertakes interim reviews when the Company determines that a triggering event that would more
likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value has occurred.

The Company uses a two-step impairment
test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized (if any) in accordance with SFAS No. 142. The step 1 calculation used to identify potential impairment compares the calculated
fair value for each of the Company’s reporting units to their respective net carrying values (book values), including goodwill, on the measurement date. If the fair value of any reporting unit is less than such reporting unit’s carrying
value, then step 2 is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss (if any) for such reporting unit.

The step 2 calculation of
the impairment test compares, by reporting unit, the implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is equal to the excess of the fair value of each reporting unit above the fair value of
such reporting unit’s identified assets and liabilities. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill for any reporting unit, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess (not to exceed the
carrying value of goodwill) for that reporting unit.

The determination of the fair value of each reporting unit and the fair value of each
reporting unit’s assets and liabilities is performed as of the measurement date using observable market data before and after the measurement date (if that subsequent information is relevant to the fair value on the measurement date).

For the November 30, 2008 impairment test, the estimated fair value of the regulated reporting unit for step 1 was based on a
combination of the following valuation techniques:

•

observable trading prices of comparable equity securities of publicly-traded water utilities considered by us to be the Company’s peers; and

•

discounted cash flow models developed from the Company’s internal forecasts.

The estimated fair values of the non-regulated reporting units were determined entirely on the basis of discounted cash flow models.

The first valuation technique applies average peer multiples to the Regulated reporting unit’s historic and forecasted cash flows. The peer multiples are calculated using the average trading prices of comparable
equity securities of publicly-traded water utilities, their published cash flows and forecasts of market price and cash flows for those peers.

The second valuation technique forecasts each reporting unit’s five-year cash flows using an estimated long-term growth rate and discounts those cash flows at their respective estimated weighted average cost of capital.



If step 2 of the impairment test is required, the Company determines the fair value of the applicable
reporting unit’s assets and liabilities. The fair values for the majority of such assets and liabilities are equal to their carrying values; however, the fair values of the applicable debt are highly dependent upon market conditions surrounding
the measurement date. For the step 2 calculations of the fair value of debt, the Company uses observable prices of instruments and indices that have risks similar to those instruments being valued, adjusted to compensate for differences in credit
profile, collateral, tax treatment and call features, to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit’s debt.

The Company has
completed its November 30, 2008 annual impairment review and does not believe that the Company’s goodwill balance was impaired. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will not be required to recognize an impairment of
goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to the Company’s performance. These market events could include a decline over a period of time of the Company’s stock price, a decline over a period of time in
valuation multiples of comparable water utilities, the lack of an increase in the Company’s market price consistent with its peer companies, or decreases in control premiums and the overhang effect. A decline in the forecasted results in our
business plan, such as changes in rate case results or capital investment budgets or changes in our interest rates, could also result in an impairment charge. Recognition of impairments of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect
the Company’s reported results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain its credit ratings, secure financing on attractive terms, maintain compliance with debt
covenants and meet expectations of our regulators.

In making the determination, we considered both qualitative and quantitative factors,
including the effect of the recent volatility in the equity and debt markets on the Company’s market capitalization. As such, the Company believes that the current evaluation technique is more appropriate than relying solely on the current
trading market value of the Company’s common stock.

In reaching our conclusion, we also made certain assumptions, which we believe to
be appropriate, that support the fair value of our reporting units. We considered, in addition to the listed trading price of the Company’s shares, the effect on that price due to RWE’s majority ownership, the effect of RWE’s expected
disposition of its owned Company shares on the market for those shares, the applicability of a control premium to our shares and certain other factors we deemed appropriate. As a result, we concluded that the Company’s fair value exceeds what
we might otherwise have concluded had we relied on market price alone.

In addition, given recent market conditions, management determined
that it was appropriate for the Company to consider the average of the Company’s closing market price over a thirty day period rather than using a particular date to calculate its market capitalization. The Company’s calculated market
capitalization within its 2008 impairment test period was approximately $940.0 million below the aggregate carrying value of its reporting units.

The difference between our calculated market capitalization and the aggregate fair value of our reporting units (which approximates book value) resulted from the estimated control premium and the estimated impact to the Company’s
market capitalization from the overhang created by RWE’s announced plans to divest a substantial portion of its ownership through further public offerings of stock.

The estimated control premium represents the incremental premium a buyer is willing to pay to acquire a controlling, majority interest in the Company. In estimating the control premium, management principally
considered the current market conditions and historical premiums paid in utility acquisitions observed in the marketplace.

The estimated
stock overhang represents the impact on the Company’s share price that we believe results from investor concerns over market price dilution due to the anticipated increase in the number of the Company’s publicly traded shares caused by the
anticipated RWE sale of the Company’s stock. As a condition of certain state regulator approvals for RWE’s sale of the Company, RWE had agreed to sell 100% of its holdings of



Company stock by April 2010 and previously announced its intentions to reduce its interest to below 50% prior to the end of 2008. Management estimated the
impact of this overhang condition using reports from multiple analysts covering the Company’s stock and other available market information.

The determination of our estimated fair value required the exercise of judgment and is highly sensitive to our assumptions. Our estimated fair values approximate the carrying value of reporting units leaving little estimated value in excess
of the required threshold of the step 1 test. Had the fair value been less than the carrying value of the reporting units, differences between the carrying value and fair value of our long-term debt (which is not taken into account in step 1 but is
required in step 2) would have increased any impairment charge indicated by step 1 by an estimated $300 million, due to accounting guidance that must be followed to measure the implied fair value of goodwill.

For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded impairment charges for goodwill, including discontinued operations, in
the amount of $750.0 million, $509.3 million and $227.8 million, respectively.

As of March 31, 2008, in light of the initial public
offering price and trading levels in our common stock subsequent to the date of the initial public offering, the Company performed an interim impairment test and, on May 9, 2008, management concluded that the carrying value of the
Company’s goodwill was impaired. The Company believed that the initial public offering price was indicative of the value of the Company at March 31, 2008, and accordingly, based on those factors recorded an impairment charge to the
goodwill of its Regulated reporting unit in the amount of $750.0 million as of March 31, 2008. The impairment charge was primarily attributed to the market price of the Company’s common stock (both the initial public offering price and the
price during subsequent trading) being less than the estimate of the initial public offering price used during the 2007 annual test. Also contributing to the impairment was a decline in the fair value of the Company’s debt (due to increased
market interest rates). As a result of the impairment charge, RWE Aqua Holdings GmbH (a wholly-owned subsidiary of RWE) transferred $245.0 million to the Company on May 13, 2008. This cash was used to reduce short-term debt. RWE is not
obligated to make any additional capital contributions.

During the third quarter of 2007, as a result of the Company’s debt being
placed on review for a possible downgrade and the proposed sale of a portion of the Company in the initial public offering, management determined at that time it was appropriate to update its valuation analysis before the next scheduled annual test.
Based on this assessment, the Company performed an interim impairment test and recorded an impairment charge to goodwill related to its Regulated reporting unit in the amount of $243.3 million as of September 30, 2007. The decline was primarily
due to a slightly lower long-term earnings forecast caused by updated customer demand and usage expectations and expectations for timing of capital expenditures and rate recovery.

The Company completed its scheduled annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2007 and determined that an impairment had occurred based upon
information regarding the Company’s market value in connection with the initial public offering. Management determined that the indicative fair value of the Company based on estimates of the initial public offering price range was the best
evidence of the Company’s market value and incorporated this indicated market value into the Company’s valuation methodology, which also considered other items, such as peer multiples, discounted cash flows and a control premium. Based on
the results of the impairment test, an impairment of $266.0 million to the Company’s carrying value was recognized as of December 31, 2007.

The 2006 impairment charge of $227.8 million was attributable to higher interest rates in the Regulated reporting unit and a change in the potential net realizable value of a non-regulated reporting unit.

Economic Environment

Continued market disruption
could cause a broad economic downturn. This downturn could lead to increased incidence of customers’ failure to pay for services delivered as well as a decreased usage by our industrial and commercial customers.

The following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006:



The following table summarizes certain financial information for our Regulated and Non-Regulated
Businesses for the periods indicated (without giving effect to inter-segment eliminations):

(1)

Adjusted EBIT is defined as earnings before interest and income taxes from continuing operations. Management evaluates the performance of its segments and allocates resources based
on several factors, of which the primary measure is Adjusted EBIT. Adjusted EBIT does not represent cash flows for periods presented and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows as a source of liquidity. Adjusted EBIT as defined by
the Company may not be comparable with Adjusted EBIT as defined by other companies.

Our primary business involves the
ownership of water and wastewater utilities that provide services to residential, commercial and industrial customers. As such, our results of operations are significantly impacted by rates authorized by the state regulatory commissions in the
states in which we operate. The table below details the annualized revenues, including step increases resulting from rate authorizations and infrastructure charges, which were granted in 2008, 2007 and 2006.

The effective dates for the larger rate increases granted in 2008 were December 8,
2008, November 28, 2008 and August 8, 2008 in New Jersey, Missouri and Illinois, respectively. The effective dates for the larger rate increases granted in 2007 were March 30, 2007, November 30, 2007 and
October 22, 2007 in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Missouri, respectively. The change in annualized rate increases granted between 2006 and 2007 can be attributed to the removal of the stay-out provisions and increased investment in our regulated
infrastructure programs



Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2008 and 2007

Operating revenues.

Our operating revenues increased by $122.7 million, or 5.5%, to $2,336.9 million for 2008 from $2,214.2
million for 2007. Regulated Businesses’ revenues increased by $95.2 million, or 4.8%, for 2008 compared to 2007. The Non-Regulated Businesses’ revenues for 2008 increased by $29.5 million, or 12.2%, from 2007.

The increase in the Regulated Businesses’ revenues was primarily due to rate increases obtained through general rate cases totaling approximately
$132.8 million as well as higher revenues resulting from surcharges of $4.5 million and from customer growth and acquisitions of approximately $3.3 million. This increase was offset by a $52.3 million decrease in revenues related to lower customer
consumption, mainly in our states in the Midwestern region of the United States primarily due to the extremely wet weather conditions in those areas during 2008, as well as decreased usage in 2008 compared to 2007 in New Jersey and Pennsylvania
mainly due to drier weather conditions in 2007.

Our Non-Regulated Businesses’ operating revenues increased by $29.5 million, or
12.2%, to $272.2 million in 2008 from $242.7 for 2007. The net increase was primarily attributable to higher revenues in our Contract Operations Group and our Homeowner Services Group, partially offset by decreased revenues in our Applied Water
Management Group and Canadian Fixed Residuals. The increase in Contract Operations Group revenues was primarily attributable to incremental revenues associated with design and build contracts, as well as increased military construction and O&M
project revenues. The increase from our Homeowner Service Group represented increased product penetration within its existing customer base. Applied Water Management Group revenues were lower than the prior year as a result of the decline in design
and build activity resulting from the downturn in new home construction.

The following table sets forth the amounts and percentages of
Regulated Businesses’ revenues and water sales volume by customer class:

Water services

—Water service operating revenues from residential customers for 2008
increased $51.6 million, or 4.5%, from 2007, primarily due to rate increases offset by a decrease in sales volume. The volume of water sold to residential customers decreased by 9.3 billion gallons, or 4.2%, from 2007, largely as a result of wetter
weather conditions in California and the Midwestern region of the United States in 2008 and drier weather conditions in New Jersey and Pennsylvania in 2007.

Water service operating revenues from commercial water customers for 2008 increased by $18.3 million, or 4.8%, mainly due to rate increases offset by decreases in sales volume compared to 2007. The volume of water
sold to commercial customers decreased by 3.1 billion gallons, or 3.3%, from 2007.



Water service operating revenues from industrial customers for 2008 increased $7.0 million, or 7.4%, from
2007 mainly due to rate increases, offset by decreased sales volume that we believe were caused by the downturn in the economy. The volume of water sold to industrial customers decreased 2.6 billion gallons, or 5.8%, from 2007.

Water service operating revenues from public and other customers increased $8.1 million, or 3.3%, from 2007 mainly due to rate increases. Revenues from
municipal governments for fire protection services and customers requiring special private fire service facilities totaled $104.3 million for 2008, an increase of $5.0 million from 2007. Revenues generated by sales to governmental entities and
resale customers for 2008 totaled $151.3 million, an increase of $3.1 million from 2007.

Wastewater services

—Our subsidiaries
provide wastewater services in 12 states. Revenues from these services for 2008 increased by $4.3 million, or 5.7%, from 2007. The increase was attributable to increases in rates charged to customers principally in Arizona, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania.

Operation and maintenance.

Operation and maintenance expense increased $57.3 million, or 4.6%, for 2008
compared to 2007.

Operation and maintenance expense for the 2008 and 2007, by major expense category, were as follows:

Production costs increased by $10.5 million, or 3.8%, for 2008 compared to 2007. Production costs
by major expense type were as follows:

The increase in fuel and power costs was primarily due to higher electricity prices. Purchased
water costs were higher as a result of rate increases resulting from higher costs incurred by our suppliers. The increase in chemical costs were attributable to rising prices as well as additional usage requirements related to fluctuating raw water
quality caused by weather conditions in some of the states in which we operate.



Employee-related costs including wage and salary, group insurance, and pension expense increased $42.2
million, or 9.1%, for 2008 compared to 2007. These employee-related costs represented 38.8% and 37.2% of operation and maintenance expenses for 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Salaries and wages increased $23.7 million and $5.1 million in our Regulated and Non-Regulated
Businesses, respectively. These increases primarily resulted from stock-based compensation expense of $3.7 million mainly attributable to the issuance of awards granted in connection with the initial public offering, $4.3 million of wages related to
job reclassification of certain hourly employees for services performed and from an increase in the number of employees primarily as a result of enhancing customer service and inflationary wage rate increases. The increase in pension expense was
primarily due to an increase in our Regulated Businesses’ pension expense of $9.1 million, or 25.1%, for 2008 over 2007. Pension expense in excess of the amount contributed to the pension plans is deferred by certain of our regulated
subsidiaries pending future recovery in rates as contributions are made to the plans. Although our pension expense calculated in accordance with SFAS 87 remained relatively unchanged, pension expense increased for 2008 due to increased contributions
by certain of our regulated operating companies whose costs are recovered based on the Company’s funding policy, which is to fund at least the minimum amount required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 which we refer to as
ERISA, rather than the SFAS 87 expense. The increase in the contributions is attributable to a change in the discount rate and lower than expected returns on plan assets. Medical benefit expenses for employees increased due to an increase in the
number of employees and the rising cost of health care. Other benefits increased primarily as a result of increased salaries and wages which in turn resulted in increased Company contribution to the 401(k) and defined contribution plans. Also other
benefit expenses increased due to the benefit expense related to the new employee stock purchase plan.

Operating supplies and services
include the day-to-day expenses of office operation, legal and other professional services, as well as information systems and other office equipment rental charges. For 2008, these costs decreased by $10.2 million, or 3.5%, compared to 2007.

Contracted services increased in 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. This increase was
primarily due to higher contracted services in our Contract Operations group in 2008 as compared to 2007, associated with several operating contracts (including a DBO project in Fillmore, California). Offsetting this increase were lower consulting
fees associated with our remediation efforts to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. These costs decreased by



$22.6 million to $9.4 million in 2008 from $32.0 million in 2007. Other operating supplies and services were lower in 2008 as 2007 costs were higher due to a
write-off of certain deferred costs totaling $1.1 million by our New Jersey subsidiary as they were no longer deemed recoverable. Additionally, our Non-Regulated Businesses recorded loss contingencies of $3.6 million in 2007. Other decreases are
associated with the cost of materials primarily related to our Contract Operations Group, due to changes in project work performed.

Maintenance materials and services, which include emergency repairs as well as costs for preventive maintenance, increased $8.3 million, or by 6.5%, for 2008 compared to 2007.

Our Regulated Businesses’ maintenance materials and service costs increased by $6.8 million
in 2008 mainly due to increased costs of $1.7 million associated with a program in Illinois to maintain valves and fire hydrants, and higher cost of removal expenses of $5.5 million in certain of our operating companies, partially offset by lower
paving costs of $1.4 million in our New Jersey and Missouri operating companies. The Non-Regulated Businesses’ maintenance and services expenses increased by $1.7 million as a result of higher frequency of claims, primarily resulting from the
increase in the number of customer contracts, with the service line protection program in our Homeowner Services Group, as well as from increased costs associated with the Contract Operations Group mainly due to costs associated with new military
operations and maintenance projects.

Customer billing and accounting expenses increased by $5.8 million, or 15.0%, for 2008 compared to
2007.

The increase was primarily the result of higher uncollectible accounts expense in our Regulated
Businesses of $0.6 million and in our Non-Regulated Businesses of $2.9 million primarily due to increased uncollectible expense in the Applied Water Management Group of $1.8 million primarily due to the collection of $1.2 million in 2007 for an
amount that was previously written-off as well as higher uncollectible expense in our Contract Operation Group. In addition, postage expense increased in our Regulated subsidiaries $0.9 million compared to 2007.

Other operation and maintenance expenses include casualty and liability insurance premiums and regulatory costs. These costs increased by $0.8 million,
or 1.8%, for 2008 compared to 2007.



Insurance expense decreased due to more favorable claims experience in 2008 compared to 2007. Regulatory
expenses increased primarily due to write-offs of deferred rate case expenses, primarily in Tennessee, Illinois, California, and Ohio as well as increased rate case amortization costs associated with rate cases settled in 2007.

Depreciation and amortization.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $3.9 million, or 1.5%, for 2008 compared to 2007. This
increase was primarily due to additional assets placed in service, mainly in our Regulated Businesses, over the last year.

General
taxes.

General taxes expense, which includes taxes for property, payroll, gross receipts, and other miscellaneous items, increased by $15.9 million, or 8.7%, in 2008 compared to 2007. This increase is primarily due to increased gross
receipts taxes of $7.9 million primarily in New Jersey and Missouri and higher property tax expense of $4.2 million primarily in Ohio and Missouri. Additionally, payroll taxes increased by $2.7 million, due to increased salaries and wages and
higher payroll tax limits.

Gain on sale of assets.

The gain on sale of assets was $0.4 million for 2008 compared to a gain
of $7.3 million for 2007. The gains in 2008 and 2007 are primarily attributable to non-recurring sales of assets no longer used in our operations.

Impairment charge.

The impairment charge was $750.0 million for 2008 compared to $509.3 million for 2007. The 2008 impairment charge was primarily due to the market price of the Company’s common stock (both the initial
public offering price and the price during subsequent trading) being less than what was anticipated during our 2007 annual test. Also contributing to the impairment was a decline in the fair value of the Company’s debt (due to increased
interest rates). The 2007 impairment charge to goodwill to our Regulated Businesses was primarily due to slightly lower long-term earnings forecast caused by our updated customer demand and usage expectations and expectations for timing of capital
expenditures and rate recovery. See “Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Goodwill Impairment.”

Other income
(deductions).

Interest expense, net of interest income, the primary component of our other income (deductions), increased by $2.0 million, or 0.7%, for 2008 compared to 2007. The increase is primarily due to increased borrowings associated
with capital expenditures. Offsetting the change in interest expense is an increase in AFUDC of $11.5 million for 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of increased construction activity in 2008 over 2007. Amortization of debt expense increased $1.0
million for 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of debt restructuring. Other items contributing to the change include lower miscellaneous income for 2008 compared to 2007 primarily as a result our Indiana subsidiary now accounting for certain income
in operating revenues in accordance with a 2007 rate order.

Provision for income taxes.

Our consolidated provision for
income taxes increased $25.0 million, or 28.8%, to $111.8 million for 2008 from $86.8 million for 2007.

Net income (loss).

The net loss for 2008 was $562.4 million compared to a net loss of $342.8 million for 2007. The variation between the periods is the result of the aforementioned changes.

Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006

Operating revenues.

Our consolidated operating revenues increased $121.1 million, or 5.8%, to $2,214.2 for 2007 from $2,093.1 million
for 2006. An increase in operating revenues for our Regulated Businesses of $132.9 million in 2007 was somewhat offset by a decrease in operating revenues for our Non-Regulated Businesses of $5.8 million. The increase in the Regulated
Businesses’ operating revenues was primarily due to rate increases of approximately $61.9 million obtained through general rate cases in New Jersey, Ohio, Arizona, California and other states. In addition, rate increases obtained through
infrastructure-related provisions in Pennsylvania, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana totaled approximately $15.5 million. Water service operating



revenues also increased due to growth of 0.7% in our Regulated Businesses’ customer base through small acquisitions in our service areas and through
growth in existing service areas. Water sales volume associated with existing customers increased by 1.5% in 2007 compared to the prior year due to dry weather mainly in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

The following table sets forth the percentage of our Regulated Businesses’ operating revenues and water sales volume by customer class:

Water Services

—Water service operating revenues from residential customers for 2007
amounted to $1,146.1 million, a 7.3% increase over 2006, primarily due to rate increases and changes in sales volume. The volume of water sold to residential customers increased by 2.9% in 2007 to 223.4 billion gallons, from 217.2 billion gallons in
2006, largely as a result of favorable weather conditions in the Mid-Atlantic states and a 0.7% increase in the residential customer base due to growth, primarily through acquisitions.

Water service operating revenues from commercial water customers for 2007 amounted to $385.3 million, a 6.2% increase over 2006, primarily due to rate
increases and changes in sales volume. The volume of water sold to commercial customers increased by 1.6% in 2007 to 93.0 billion gallons, from 91.6 billion gallons in 2006, driven by favorable weather conditions and partially offset by a decline in
the number of commercial customers.

Water service operating revenues from industrial customers amounted to $94.7 million in 2007, a 2.9%
increase over 2006, primarily due to rate increases and changes in sales volume. The volume of water sold to industrial customers increased by 0.5% in 2007 to 44.6 billion gallons, from 44.4 billion gallons in 2006.

Water service operating revenues from public and other customers increased $17.4 million for 2007 to $247.6 million from $230.2 million for 2006, mainly
due to rate increases and changes in sales volume. Revenues from municipal governments for fire protection services and customers requiring special private fire service facilities totaled $99.3 million for 2007, an increase of $0.8 million over the
same period of 2006. Revenues generated by sales to governmental entities and resale customers for 2007 totaled $148.3 million, an increase of $16.6 million from 2006.

Wastewater Services

—Our subsidiaries provide wastewater services in 12 states. Operating revenues from these services increased by 4.7% to $75.6 million for 2007. The increase reflects a growth of 0.4% in
the number of wastewater customers served but is primarily due to increases in rates charged to customers in states where we have wastewater operations (principally Arizona, Hawaii, and New Jersey).

Our Non-Regulated revenues decreased by $5.8 million, or 2.3%, to $242.7 million in 2007 from $248.5 million for 2006. The net decline in revenues
is primarily attributable to a $15.8 million decrease in



revenues of our Contract Operations Group, partially offset by a $7.4 million increase in revenues of our Homeowner Services Group, and an increase of $3.5
million from our other Non-Regulated Businesses. The decline in revenues of our Contract Operations Group includes the effects of having substantially completed the construction of the Lake Pleasant Water Treatment plant, a large water treatment
plant in Phoenix, Arizona, during 2006 ($49.5 million of construction revenue recognized in 2006 compared to $5.2 million in 2007). Pursuant to our DBO contract with the city of Phoenix, we served as the lead contractor in connection with the
construction of the Lake Pleasant facility, which includes an 80 million gallons-per-day surface water treatment plant and granular activated carbon reactivation system. The Lake Pleasant facility is significantly larger in size and function
compared to other projects with which we have been engaged. However, we do not expect the completion of this project to have a material impact on our results of operations. Revenues from that project were partially replaced by new contracts,
including a DBO project in Fillmore, California generating $12.3 million of incremental revenues and new military projects generating approximately $10.0 million of revenues. The increase from our Homeowner Services Group represents expansion into
new geographic markets (Virginia and Trenton, New Jersey). The increase in our other Non-Regulated Businesses’ revenues is due to revenues attributable to special projects in 2007.

Operation and maintenance.

Our consolidated operation and maintenance expense increased by $71.9 million, or 6.1%, to $1,246.5 million for
2007 from $1,174.5 million for 2006.

Operation and maintenance expense by major category was as follows:

Production costs, including fuel and power, purchased water, chemicals and waste disposal,
increased by $20.3 million, or 7.9%, for 2007 compared to 2006.

The increases were primarily attributable to increased demand and higher electricity prices, as
rate freezes resulting from electricity deregulation expired in some states in which we operate.



Employee-related costs including wage and salary, group insurance, and pension expense increased by $44.6
million, or 10.6%, for 2007 compared to 2006. These costs represented 37.2% and 35.7% of operation and maintenance expense for 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The increase in 2007 was due to higher wage, salary and group insurance expenses in our Regulated
Businesses, primarily resulting from an increase in the number of employees to enable service enhancements in our Regulated Businesses as well as wage rate increases. This increase was offset by a reduction in pension expense. Pension expense in
excess of the amount contributed to the pension plans is deferred by some of our regulated subsidiaries pending future recovery in rates as contributions are made to the plans. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower pension expense in 2007.
In addition, pension expense for 2006 included additional pension expense due to curtailment charges and a special transaction benefit charge.

Operating supplies and services include the day-to-day expenses of office operation, legal and other professional services, as well as information systems and other office equipment, facilities rental charges and other miscellaneous
expenses. For 2007, these costs increased by $2.1 million or 0.7% compared to 2006.

The decrease in contracted services is primarily associated with the design and build of the Lake
Pleasant Water Treatment Plant in Phoenix, Arizona. In 2006, these costs were approximately $38.7 million, compared to $4.3 million in 2007. Additionally, the decrease reflects operating contracts of our Non-Regulated Businesses that ended during
2006, and a decline in design and build activity by the Applied Water Management Group of $3.4 million due to a downturn in new home construction. Offsetting these decreases were additional expenses associated with several other contracts in our
Non-Regulated Businesses, including a DBO project in Fillmore, totaling $7.6 million in 2007 compared to $0.4 million in 2006, as well as increased military contract expenses of $6.1 million. Also offsetting the decrease were consulting fees
associated with our remediation efforts in connection with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. These costs increased $15.1 million over 2006. Office supplies and services increased as a result of increased travel as well as inflation. Transportation
costs increased primarily within our Regulated Businesses due to increased leasing costs and higher gasoline prices, amounting to approximately $3.2 million. Other operating supplies and services decreased primarily as a result of the aforementioned
Non-Regulated contracts, with Lake Pleasant costs of $0.8 million in 2007 compared to $10.1 million in 2006 and Fillmore DBO costs of $4.8 million in 2007 compared to $0.2 million in 2006. Offsetting these decreases was a 2006 restatement by our
Indiana subsidiary of $2.4 million previously disallowed in the regulatory process. Additional expenses related to the RWE Divesture were $0.8 million higher for 2007 than 2006 due to higher divesture support costs.



Maintenance materials and services, which include emergency repairs as well as costs for preventive
maintenance, increased by $18.2 million, or 16.6%, for 2007 compared to 2006.

These increases were primarily the result of a larger number of main breaks in 2007 compared to
2006 experienced by several of our operating subsidiaries due to winter weather conditions, increased paving costs for our New Jersey, Missouri, Illinois and Pennsylvania subsidiaries, as well as higher expenses in our Non-Regulated Businesses,
primarily the Homeowner Services Group.

Customer billing and accounting expenses decreased by $16.4 million, or 30.0%, for 2007 compared
to 2006.

The decrease was primarily due to lower bad debt expense of $9.2 million in our Regulated Business
and $5.8 million in our Non-Regulated Businesses as a result of an increased focus on collection of past due accounts.

Other operation and
maintenance expenses include casualty and liability insurance premiums and regulatory costs. These costs increased by $3.1 million, or 7.3%, for 2007 compared to 2006.

Insurance related expenses increased due to less favorable claims experience compared to 2006.
This unfavorable variance was offset by a reduction in regulatory expenses due to the write-off of certain deferred rate case expenses in 2006 associated with our California subsidiary.

Depreciation and amortization.

Our consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased $8.1 million, or 3.1%, to $267.3 million
for 2007 from $259.2 million for 2006. The increase was primarily due to property placed in service, net of retirements, of $798.8 million as a result of an increased focus on infrastructure spending mainly in our Regulated Businesses.



General taxes.

Our consolidated general taxes expense, which includes taxes for property,
payroll, gross receipts and other miscellaneous items, decreased $1.8 million, or 1.0%, to $183.3 million for 2007 from $185.1 million for 2006. The decrease was primarily due to lower taxes for expatriates because employees seconded by Thames Water
to American Water were no longer employed by American Water in 2007.

Loss (gain) on sale of assets.

Our consolidated gain on
sale of assets was $7.3 million for 2007 compared to a loss of $0.1 million for 2006 due to non-recurring sales of assets not needed in our utility operations in 2007.

Impairment charges.

Our consolidated impairment charges were $509.3 million for 2007 and $221.7 million, excluding discontinued operations, for 2006. The 2007 impairment charges were primarily due to
slightly lower long-term earnings caused by updated customer demand and usage expectations and expectations for timing of capital expenditures and rate recovery as well as new information regarding our market value. The 2006 impairment charge was
primarily attributable to higher interest rates in our Regulated Businesses and a change in the potential net realizable value of our Non-Regulated Businesses.

Other income (deductions).

Interest expense, the primary component of our consolidated other income (deductions), decreased $82.8 million, or 22.6%, to $283.2 million for 2007 from $366.0 million for
2006. The decline was primarily due to the repayment of outstanding debt with new equity contributions from RWE in order to establish a capital structure that is consistent with other regulated utilities and also to meet the capital structure
expectations of various state regulatory commissions. This decrease was offset slightly by higher interest expense of our Regulated Businesses of $9.8 million mainly due to increased borrowings to fund capital programs.

Provision for income taxes.

Our consolidated provision for income taxes increased $39.9 million, or 85.1%, to $86.8 million for 2007 from
$46.9 million for 2006. The increase is due to higher taxable income in 2007 as compared to 2006.

Net income (loss).

Our
consolidated net loss including results from discontinued operations increased $180.6 million, or 111.3%, to $342.8 million for 2007 from $162.2 million for 2006. The increase is the result of the changes discussed above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our business is
capital intensive and requires considerable capital resources. A portion of these capital resources are provided by internally generated cash flows from operations. When necessary, we obtain funds from external sources in the capital markets and
through bank borrowings. Our access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on our credit ratings and current business conditions, including that of the water utility industry in general as well as conditions in the debt or equity capital
markets. If these business and market conditions deteriorate to the extent that we no longer have access to the capital markets at reasonable terms, we have access to revolving credit facilities with aggregate bank commitments of $850.0 million that
we currently utilize to fulfill our short-term liquidity needs and to issue letters of credit. See “—Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt.”

In addition, our regulated utility subsidiaries receive advances and contributions from customers, home builders and real estate developers to fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas. Advances for
construction are refundable for limited periods, which vary according to state regulations, as new customers begin to receive service or other contractual obligations are fulfilled. Amounts which are no longer refundable are reclassified to
contributions in aid of construction. Utility plant funded by advances and contributions is excluded from the rate base. Generally, we depreciate contributed property and amortize contributions in aid of construction at the composite rate of the
related property. Some of our subsidiaries do not depreciate contributed property, based on regulatory guidelines.



We use our capital resources, including cash, to (i) fund capital requirements, including
construction expenditures, (ii) pay off maturing debt, (iii) pay dividends, (iv) fund pension and postretirement welfare obligations and (v) invest in new and existing ventures. We spend a significant amount of cash on
construction projects that have a long-term return on investment. Additionally, we operate in rate-regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited, and where such recovery takes place over an extended period of
time, as our recovery is subject to regulatory lag. See “Business—Regulation—Economic Regulation.” As a result of these factors, our working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, was in a net deficit
position as of December 31, 2008.

We expect to fund future maturities of long-term debt through a combination of external debt and
cash flow from operations. We have no plans to reduce debt significantly.

We rely on our revolving credit facility and the capital markets
to satisfy our liquidity needs. Disruptions in the credit markets may discourage lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments, extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments. Market disruptions may also limit our
ability to issue debt securities in the capital markets. On September 15, 2008, we sought to issue commercial paper but were unable to consummate the issuance due to adverse market conditions. In order to meet our short-term liquidity needs we
are borrowing under our existing $840.0 million revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to expire on September 15, 2012. On September 15, 2008, a majority of our lenders agreed to extend $685.0 million of commitments under this
revolving credit facility to September 15, 2013. AWCC had $345.0 million of outstanding borrowings and $43.9 million of outstanding letters of credit under this credit facility as of February 23, 2009. AWCC had $178.5 million of outstanding
overnight commercial paper as of February 23, 2009. We can provide no assurances that our lenders will meet their existing commitments or that we will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or
at all.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had issued, through its subsidiaries, $120.3 million of variable rate demand bonds, which are
periodically remarketed. We can provide no assurances that the bonds will be remarketed successfully or at reasonable interest rates. Bonds totaling $24.9 million are issued by Illinois American Water, bonds totaling $8.6 million are issued by
Arizona American Water and the remaining $86.9 million of bonds are issued by AWCC. During the months of January and February 2009, AWCC purchased its variable rate demand bonds because no buyer was willing to purchase the bonds at market rates.
Although buyers periodically purchased the bonds from AWCC at market rates during January and February 2009, at February 23, 2009, AWCC holds all $120.3 million in treasury. Since the debt has been remarketed for periods no longer than one week and
the Company cannot be certain remarketing will be successful, the debt is included in current portion of long-term debt at December 31, 2008.

On February 17, 2009, the President signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009, which we refer to as the Act, into law. The Act contains various tax provisions, including many that will provide benefits to the tax-exempt
bond market. There are provisions modifying the rules for certain classes of tax-exempt bonds which may enhance the marketability of the Company’s tax exempt bonds. Additionally, the Act makes available $4 billion for capitalized grants
for Clean Water State Revolving Funds and $2 billion for capitalized grants under the Safe Drinking Water Act. States will re-allocate these funds to subsidize eligible projects and the Company intends to apply for this subsidized financing in a
number of states in which it operates. Since the issuance of tax-exempt bonds and financing from state revolving funds is subject to governmental approvals, at this time we are not certain how much of these funds, if any, will be available to
investor owned utilities.

In addition, we believe we will be able to avail ourselves of the following tax provisions of the Act:

•

an extension of the bonus depreciation provisions to property placed in service in 2009;

•

the election to increase the carryback period for net operating losses; and

There can be no assurances of our ability to take advantage of these new provisions, and any expected benefits to us are uncertain.



Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the sale of water and wastewater services and, due to the seasonality of operations, are
weighted toward the third quarter of each fiscal year. Our future cash flows from operating activities will be affected by economic utility regulation; infrastructure investment; inflation; compliance with environmental, health and safety standards;
production costs; customer growth; declining per customer usage of water; and weather and seasonality. See “—Factors Affecting our Results of Operations.”

Cash flows from operating activities have been a reliable, steady source of cash flow, sufficient to meet operating requirements and a portion of our capital expenditures requirements. We will seek access to debt and
equity capital markets to meet the balance of our capital expenditure requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully access such markets on favorable terms or at all. Operating cash flows can be negatively affected by
changes in our rate regulatory environments or changes in our customer economic outlook and ability to pay for service in a timely manner. We can provide no assurance that our customers’ historical payment pattern will continue in the future.

During 2008, the Company’s unfunded status of its pension plan increased significantly primarily due to lower than expected 2008
asset returns, which are expected to result in increased benefit costs and required funding contributions in future years. Such an increase is likely to be material to results in 2009 and subsequent years. Based on current plan assets and expected
future asset returns, the Company currently estimates the increase to pension and postretirement expense (net of capitalized amounts) in 2009 to be approximately $32 million, pre-tax. It is the Company’s intent to work with PUCs in the states
in which it operates to minimize the impact of such increases on its results of operations. The Company currently expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts of $125.9 million, $132.5 million, $124.7 million,
$161.9 million and $123.2 million in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively. Actual amounts contributed could change significantly from these estimates.

The following table provides a summary of the major items affecting our cash flows from operating activities for the periods indicated:

(1)

Includes (gain) loss on sale of businesses, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, removal costs net of salvage, provision for deferred income taxes, amortization of
deferred investment tax credits, provision for losses on utility accounts receivable, allowance for other funds used during construction, (gain) loss on sale of assets, deferred regulatory costs, amortization of deferred charges and other non-cash
items, net, less pension and postretirement healthcare contributions.

(2)

Changes in working capital include changes to accounts receivable and unbilled utility revenue, taxes receivable (including federal income), other current assets, accounts payable,
taxes accrued (including federal income), interest accrued and other current liabilities.

The increase in cash flows from
operations during 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to increased revenues partially offset by higher contributions to our pension and postretirement healthcare trusts.

The increase in cash flows from operations during 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to improvements in working capital mainly driven by changes in
taxes accrued and other current liabilities, slightly offset by changes in accounts receivable and unbilled utility revenues.

We intend to
make $128.1 million of contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit trusts during 2009. This increase was primarily caused by the impact of the significant decline in trust asset values during



2009. Through February 2009, we have made contributions to fund pension and other postretirement benefits of $17.1 and
$10.4 million respectively.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Cash flows used in investing activities were as follows for the periods indicated:

(1)

Includes allowances for other funds used during construction, acquisitions, proceeds from the sale of assets and securities, proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations,
removal costs from property, plant and equipment retirements, receivables from affiliates, restricted funds and investment in equity investee.

Cash flows used in investing activities increased in 2008 compared to 2007 and in 2007 compared to 2006, as we continued to increase our investment in regulated infrastructure projects. From 2009 to 2013, we
estimate that Company-funded capital investment will total between $4.0 billion and $4.5 billion. We anticipate spending between $790 million and $1.0 billion yearly on Company-funded capital investment for the foreseeable future, depending upon the
timing of major capital projects. We expect construction expenditures to be approximately $800 million during 2009. We intend to invest capital prudently to provide essential services to our regulated customer base, while working with regulators in
the various states in which we operate to have the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment and a return of our investment. As part of our strategy to improve operational efficiencies, we are evaluating our processes,
along with the information systems associated with those processes, to optimize workflow throughout our field operations as well as streamlining our back-office operations, as we believe are necessary and appropriate. When we make adjustments to our
operations, we will incur incremental expenses, including costs to upgrade or replace outdated information systems, prior to realizing the benefit of a more efficient workforce and operating structure. We believe that increasing our operating
efficiency and controlling the costs associated with the operation of our business are important to providing the quality service to our customers and communities we serve as well as to our long-term competitiveness. We are currently developing a
timeline for the implementation of this strategic initiative but expect that it will span a period of three to five years. The details, including scope, cost and implementation of these solutions will not be fully known until the data gathering
phase has been completed, which is targeted for December 2009. Expenditures associated with this project are included in the $4.0 billion to $4.5 billion capital investment spending outlined above.

Our infrastructure investment plan consists of both infrastructure renewal programs, where we replace infrastructure as needed, and major capital
investment projects, where we will construct new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities. Our projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions
and other factors.

The following table provides a summary of our historical construction expenditures:



Construction expenditures for the periods noted above were partially offset by customer advances and
contributions for construction (net of refunds) of $3.1 million, $35.8 million, and $47.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Customer advances and contributions are reflected in net cash flows from
financing activities. Capital expenditures during the periods noted above were related to the renewal of supply and treatment assets, new water mains and customer service lines, as well as rehabilitation of existing water mains and hydrants.

Construction expenditures for 2008 increased by $258.0 million, or 34.4%, over 2007. Expenditures related to transmission and distribution
increased by $123.9 million in 2008 over 2007 and meter and fire hydrant replacements increased by $44.2 million in 2008 compared to 2007. These increases occurred due to an increase in the rate of infrastructure replacement. Treatment and pumping
expenditures increased by $33.9 million in 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of significant treatment improvements in a number of states in which we operate including Kentucky, Illinois and Arizona.

On April 25, 2008, the Kentucky Public Service Commission approved Kentucky-American Water Company’s application for a certificate of
convenience and necessity to construct a 20.0 million gallon per day treatment plant on the Kentucky River and a 30.6 mile pipeline to meet Central Kentucky’s water supply deficit. The Kentucky project is expected to be completed by the
end of 2010 with an estimated cost of $162 million.

Construction expenditures for 2007 increased by $67.9 million, or 10.0%, over
2006. The increase consisted mainly of infrastructure replacements and upgrades to treatment facilities at several plants including Joplin, Missouri, Maricopa County, Arizona, Franklin Township, New Jersey and Champaign, Illinois.

Our construction program consists of both infrastructure renewal programs, where we replace infrastructure as needed, and construction of new water and
wastewater treatment and delivery facilities to meet new customer growth. An integral aspect of our strategy is to seek growth through tuck-ins and other acquisitions which are complementary to our existing business and support the continued
geographical diversification and growth of our operations. Generally, acquisitions are funded initially with short-term debt and later refinanced with the proceeds from long-term debt or equity offerings.

We also conduct ongoing reviews of our existing investments. As a result of these reviews, we sold the operations of various non-regulated water-related
businesses during 2006 and 2007.

The following provides a summary of the major acquisitions and dispositions affecting our cash flows from
investing activities in the years indicated:

2008:

•

We paid approximately $12.5 million for the acquisition of water and waste water systems.

•

We received approximately $12.6 million from the sale of other assets, which included $10.6 million in cash from the sale of the Felton water system. In September
2008, our California subsidiary completed its sale of the Felton water system to San Lorenzo Valley Water District (“SLVWD”). Under the terms of the agreement, SLVWD paid $13.4 million for the operating assets of the water system, which
serves approximately 1,330 customers in Felton. The payment included a $10.6 million cash payment to California American Water and the assumption by SLVWD of $2.8 million in debt. The sale of the Felton system resulted in a loss on sale of
$0.4 million.

2007:

•

We paid approximately $15.9 million for the acquisition of a number of water and wastewater systems, the largest of which was S.J. Services Inc., the parent company
of Pennsgrove Water Supply Company, Inc. and South Jersey Water Supply Company, Inc. The purchase price, including acquisition costs, for S.J. Services Inc. was $13.5 million in cash.



•

We received approximately $9.7 million in cash proceeds from the sale of a group of assets of the Residuals business.

•

We received $16.3 million in cash proceeds from the sale of other assets, including $13.0 million of proceeds on a property in Mansfield, New Jersey owned by a
Non-Regulated subsidiary.

2006:

•

We paid approximately $12.5 million for the acquisition of water and wastewater systems.

•

We received approximately $30.2 million in cash proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations, including a group of assets of the Residuals business and the
Underground business.

Our investing activities require considerable capital resources which we have generated in
operations and attained through financing activities. We can provide no assurances that these resources will be sufficient to meet our expected investment needs and may be required to delay or reevaluate our investment plans.

During 2007, NJAWC, entered into an agreement with the City of Trenton, New Jersey to purchase the assets of the City’s water system located in four
surrounding townships. The agreement required approval from the New Jersey PUC. The initial proposed purchase price of $100.0 million was subsequently amended to $75.0 million in addition the agreement has been amended to include the provision of
technical services from the city over seven years to ensure a smooth transition of ownership at a cost of $5.0 million. The administrative law judge hearing the matter has issued an Initial Decision approving the Stipulation and sent the Initial
Decision to the New Jersey PUC for consideration. On February 25, 2009, a petition seeking a referendum was filed with the City of Trenton. The petition seeks to force the City Council to reconsider its prior approval of the sale, and a vote as to
whether the Ordinance approving the sale of the system should go forward or to be negated. The Company can provide no assurance as to the outcome of the referendum nor can we provide assurance that the Initial Decision will ultimately be approved by
the New Jersey PUC. Included in the Stipulation, and dependent upon final approval, the Company intends to purchase finished water from the City of Trenton for the next twenty years under a water supply agreement. The acquisition is expected to add
approximately forty thousand customers to the Company’s customer base.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Our financing activities whose primary purpose is to fund construction expenditures, include the issuance of long-term and short-term debt, primarily
through our wholly-owned financing subsidiary, AWCC. We intend to access the capital markets on a regular basis, subject to market conditions. In addition, we have received capital contributions from RWE and intend to issue equity in the future to
maintain an appropriate capital structure, subject to any restrictions in the registration rights agreement between us and RWE. In order to finance new infrastructure, we received customer advances and contributions for construction (net of refunds)
of $3.1 million, $35.8 million, and $47.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, 2006, respectively. In February 2009, AWCC completed its public offering of $75.0 million of 8.25% senior notes with a maturity date of 2038. The net
proceeds of the offering were used to repay short-term debt incurred to fund capital expenditures and general working capital purposes.

In May 2008, AWCC issued senior notes through private placement offerings totaling $200.0 million. Interest rates ranged from 6.25% to 6.55%, and maturities ranged from 2018 to 2023. On May 13, 2008, we received a cash equity
contribution from RWE of $245.0 million. In November 2008, AWCC issued $75.0 million of 10% senior notes with a maturity date of 2038 through a public offering. Proceeds from the $275.0 million in debt offerings and the $245.0 million in cash equity
contribution were used to repay short-term debt incurred to fund capital expenditures and general working capital purposes.

AWCC issued
senior notes through private placement offerings totaling $2,117.0 million during 2007. Interest rates ranged from 5.39% to 6.59% and maturities ranged from seven years to 30 years. RWE made equity



contributions to the Company amounting to $1,067.1 million and $1,194.5 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company used the equity contributions
and proceeds from the senior notes to offset loans payable to RWE, to repay outstanding commercial paper and for other corporate purposes.

Additionally, during September 2007, AWCC issued $1,750.0 million of RWE redemption notes to RWE. The RWE redemption notes bear interest monthly at the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate, which we refer to as LIBOR, plus 22.5 basis
points and mature on the earliest of the following to occur (a) March 20, 2009, (b) the date on which the Company and RWE mutually agree to terminate the notes with all accrued and unpaid interest and principal becoming immediately
due and payable in full, or (c) the date on which RWE no longer owns more than 80% of the voting rights of the Company. The Company used the proceeds from the RWE redemption notes to redeem $1,750.0 million of its 5.9% mandatory redeemable
preferred stock held by RWE.

During October 2007, AWCC issued $750.0 million in new senior notes with a term of 10 years and a fixed
interest rate of 6.085% and $750.0 million in new senior notes with a term of 30 years and a fixed interest rate of 6.593%. AWCC used the proceeds to fund the redemption of $1,286.0 million aggregate principal amount of RWE redemption notes and
$206.0 million (including after tax gains of $2.2 million, net of $1.4 million of tax) aggregate principal amount of RWE notes. In the second quarter of 2008, the Company completed an offer to exchange fully registered 6.085% Senior Notes due 2017
and fully registered 6.593% Senior Notes due 2037 for all of its outstanding unregistered notes of the same series. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the exchange offer, nor did the Company’s debt level change as a result of the
exchange offer. The terms of the registered notes and the unregistered notes are substantially identical in all material respects. In December 2007, we used the net proceeds from the issuance of approximately $415.0 million of commercial paper and
$49.0 million of excess cash to fund the repayment of approximately $464.0 million of RWE redemption notes.

Our board of directors
has adopted a dividend policy to distribute to our stockholders a portion of our net cash provided by operating activities as regular quarterly dividends, rather than retaining that cash for other purposes. Our policy is to distribute 50% to 70% of
our net income annually. We expect that dividends will be paid every March, June, September and December of each fiscal year to holders of record approximately 15 days prior to the distribution date. Since the dividends on our common stock will not
be cumulative, only declared dividends will be paid. For 2008, we paid a dividend of $0.20 per share on September 2, 2008 and December 1, 2008. There were no dividend payments made for 2007. Subject to applicable law and the discretion of
our board of directors, we will pay cash dividends of approximately $0.20 per share per quarter in 2009, to be paid approximately 60 days after the end of each fiscal quarter. The quarterly and annual average aggregate dividend amounts for the four
quarters would be $34.3 million, and $137.1 million annually. The aggregate dividend amounts are based upon the estimated average 171.3 million shares outstanding during the next four quarters. Under Delaware law, our board of directors may
declare dividends only to the extent of our “surplus” (which is defined as total assets at fair market value

minus

total liabilities,

minus

statutory capital) or, if there is no surplus, out of our net profits for the then
current and/or immediately preceding fiscal year. Although we believe we will have sufficient net profits or surplus to pay dividends at the anticipated levels during the next four quarters, our board of directors will seek periodically to assure
itself of this before actually declaring any dividends. In future periods, our board of directors may seek opinions from outside valuation firms to the effect that our solvency or assets are sufficient to allow payment of dividends, and such
opinions may not be forthcoming. If we sought and were not able to obtain such an opinion, we likely would not be able to pay dividends.

On February 6, 2009, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.20 per share payable on March 2, 2009 to all shareholders of record as of February 18, 2009.



The following long-term debt was issued in 2008:

The following long-term debt and preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements were
repurchased or retired through optional redemption or payment at maturity during 2008:

The following long-term debt was issued in 2007:

In 2007, in connection with the acquisition of S.J. Services Inc, we assumed $3.5 million of
long-term debt consisting of senior notes and state financing authority loans with interest rates ranging from 0.00% to 9.10% and maturities ranging from 2008 to 2025.



The following debt and preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements were retired through
extinguishments, optional redemption or payment at maturity in 2007:

From time to time and as market conditions warrant, we may engage in long-term debt retirements
via tender offers, open market repurchases or other viable alternatives to strengthen our balance sheets.

Credit Facilities and
Short-Term Debt

The components of short-term debt were as follows:

AWCC has entered into a $10.0 million committed revolving line of credit with PNC Bank, N.A.
This line of credit will terminate on December 31, 2009 unless extended and is used primarily for short-term working capital needs. Interest rates on advances under this line of credit are based on either the prime rate of PNC Bank, N.A. or the
applicable LIBOR for the term selected plus 200 basis points. In addition, there is a fee of 25 basis points charged quarterly on the portion of the commitment that is undrawn. As of February 23, 2009, December 31, 2008 and December 31,
2007 there was $0.8 million, $0.0 million and $ 9.0 million, respectively, outstanding under this revolving line of credit. If this line of credit were not extended beyond its current maturity date of December 31, 2009, AWCC would continue
to have access to its $840.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility described below.



AWCC, our finance subsidiary, has entered into an $840 million senior unsecured credit facility
syndicated among the following group of 11 banks with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. acting as administrative agent.

This revolving credit facility, which was originally scheduled to terminate on September 15,
2011, is principally used to support the commercial paper program at AWCC and to provide up to $150.0 million in letters of credit. On September 14, 2007, this revolving credit facility was extended for an additional year by the facility bank
group, making the new termination date September 15, 2012. On September 15, 2008, a majority of the banks agreed to further extend $685.0 million of commitments under this revolving credit facility to September 15, 2013. On
December 18, 2008 The Bank of New York Mellon joined the credit facility syndicate with a commitment amount of $40.0 million through September 15, 2012. If any lender defaults in its obligation to fund advances, the Company may
request the other lenders to assume the defaulting lender’s commitment or replace such defaulting lender by designating an assignee willing to assume the commitment, however, the remaining lenders have no obligation to assume a defaulting
lender’s commitment and we can provide no assurances that we will replace a defaulting lender. AWCC had $345.0 million of outstanding borrowings and $43.9 million of outstanding letters of credit under this credit facility as of
February 23, 2009. As of February 23, 2009, AWCC had $178.5 million of commercial paper outstanding.

On December 31, 2008 and
December 31, 2007, AWCC had the following sub-limits and available capacity under the revolving credit facility and indicated amounts of outstanding commercial paper:

Interest rates on advances under the revolving credit facility are based on either prime or LIBOR
plus an applicable margin based upon our credit ratings, as well as total outstanding amounts under the agreement at the time of the borrowing. The maximum LIBOR margin is 55 basis points.

The revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization of not more than 0.70 to 1.00. On
December 31, 2008, our ratio was 0.56 and therefore we were in compliance with the ratio.

The weighted average interest rate on
short-term borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 was approximately 3.51% and 5.49%, respectively.



On December 17, 2008, we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange
Commission relating to a proposed follow-on public offering of our common stock. The proposed offering would include $300 million secondary offering by the selling stockholder, a subsidiary of RWE AG, with the proceeds going to RWE and concurrently,
a $300 million primary offering by us will occur with proceeds used to redeem short-term debt. There are no assurances that this transaction will occur in 2009. If we are unable to complete this transaction in 2009 or secure additional long-term
financing, we could reach our maximum limits on our short-term borrowing facilities.

Capital Structure

Our capital structure was as follows:

The changes to our capital resource mix during 2008, 2007 and 2006 were accomplished through the
various financing activities noted above in “Cash from Financing Activities”. The capital structure at December 31, 2008 more closely reflects our expected future capital structure.

As a condition to some PUC approvals of the RWE Divestiture, we agreed to maintain a capital structure with a minimum of 45% common equity at the time of
the consummation of our initial public offering on April 28, 2008. As a result of the impairment charges recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2008, our capital structure did not meet this minimum requirement and we received a cash
equity contribution from RWE of $245.0 million on May 1, 2008. This cash was used to repay $243.4 million of short-term debt. Contributions from RWE were $1,067.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. RWE is not obligated to make
any additional capital contributions.

Debt Covenants

Our debt agreements contain financial and non-financial covenants. To the extent that we are not in compliance, we or our subsidiaries may be restricted
in our ability to pay dividends, issue debt or access our revolving credit lines. We were in compliance with our covenants as of December 31, 2008. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry and Business—Our failure to
comply with restrictive covenants under our credit facilities could trigger repayment obligations.” Long-term debt indentures contain a number of covenants that, among other things, limit, subject to certain exceptions, the Company from issuing
debt secured by the Company’s assets. Certain long term notes required the company to maintain a ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization of not more than 0.70 to 1.00. In addition, the Company has $1,104.9
million of notes which include the right to redeem the notes in whole or in part from time to time subject to certain restrictions.

Security Ratings

Our access to the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and their respective
financing costs in those markets depend on the securities ratings of the entity that is accessing the capital markets. We primarily access the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, through AWCC. However, we do issue debt at our
regulated subsidiaries, primarily in the form of tax exempt securities, to lower our overall cost of debt. The following table shows the Company’s securities ratings as of December 31, 2008:

Securities

Moody’s Investors

Service

Standard & Poor’s

Ratings Service

Senior unsecured debt

Baa2

BBB+

Commercial paper

P2

A2



On June 19, 2008, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, which we refer to as S&P,
downgraded the senior unsecured issuer rating of AWCC to “BBB+” (stable outlook) from “A-” (negative outlook). In addition, S&P assigned a “BBB+” corporate credit rating to American Water and affirmed AWCC’s
“A-2” short-term rating. On November 14, 2008, S&P affirmed its “BBB+” corporate credit rating on AWCC and American Water. On January 16, 2009, S&P assigned its “BBB+” unsecured debt rating to AWCC $75.0 million
senior unsecured monthly notes due December 1, 2038.

On August 28, 2007, Moody’s Investors Service, which we refer to as
Moody’s, placed both the long-term and short-term ratings of AWCC on review for possible downgrade. On October 12, 2007, Moody’s downgraded the senior unsecured issuer rating of AWCC to “Baa2” from “Baa1.” In
addition, Moody’s assigned a “Baa2” senior unsecured issuer rating to American Water and affirmed AWCC’s “P-2” short-term rating. The rating outlook for both American Water and AWCC is stable.

A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning
rating agency, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Security ratings are highly dependent upon our ability to generate cash flows from financing and operating activities in an amount sufficient to service our debt
and meet our investment plans. We can provide no assurances that our ability to generate cash flow is sufficient to maintain our existing ratings.

None of our borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings, although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under our credit facilities.

As part of the normal course of business, we routinely enter into contracts for the purchase and sale of water, energy, fuels and other services. These
contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit us and our counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable contract
law, if we are downgraded by a credit rating agency, especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate
assurance of future performance. Depending on its net position with a counterparty, the demand could be for the posting of collateral. In the absence of expressly agreed provisions that specify the collateral that must be provided, the obligation to
supply the collateral requested will be a function of the facts and circumstances of the Company’s situation at the time of the demand. If we can reasonably claim that we are willing and financially able to perform our obligations, it may be
possible to successfully argue that no collateral should be posted or that only an amount equal to two or three months of future payments should be sufficient. We do not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the
Company’s results of operation, financial position or cash flows.

Recent Market Conditions

The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity despite the current disruption of the capital and credit markets. The Company funds liquidity needs for
capital investment, working capital and other financial commitments through cash flows from operations, public and private debt offerings, commercial paper markets and credit facilities with $850.0 million in aggregate total commitment from a
diversified group of banks and we had $281.8 million available as of February 23, 2009. The Company closely monitors the financial condition of the financial institutions associated with its credit facilities.

The Company’s retirement trust assets are exposed to the market prices of debt and equity securities. Changes to the retirement trust asset value
can impact the Company’s pension and other benefits expense, funded status and future minimum funding requirements. Our risk is reduced through our ability to recover pension and other benefit costs through rates. In addition, pension and other
benefits liabilities decrease as fixed income asset values decrease (fixed income yields rise) since the rate at which we discount pension and other retirement trust asset future obligations is highly correlated to fixed income yields. During 2008
the market value of our pension



and postretirement benefit trust assets declined by $171.9 million. The Company performed an asset/liability study on its pension and postretirement benefit
trust assets, and changed the asset allocation from 60% equities and 40% fixed income to 70% equities and 30% fixed income. This new investment allocation was implemented in December 2008. Additionally a reduction in fixed income yields (rate used
to discount obligations) at the end of 2008 caused an increase to pension and postretirement benefit liabilities. The reduction of asset values combined with an increase in pension and postretirement benefit liabilities will constitute an increase
to pension and postretirement benefit costs (net of capitalized amounts) of approximately $32.0 million during 2009 compared to 2008.

The
Company also assessed the impact of the severe liquidity crises at major financial institutions on the Company’s ability to access capital markets on reasonable terms. On September 15, 2008, the Company was unable to access short-term
liquidity through its A-2/P-2 rated commercial paper program. The Company therefore utilized its credit facilities to repay maturing commercial paper and fund its short-term liquidity needs. Although the Company’s credit facility syndicate
banks are currently meeting all of their lending obligations, there can be no assurance that these banks will be able to meet their obligations in the future if the liquidity crises intensify or are protracted.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had issued, through its subsidiaries, $120.3 million of variable rate demand bonds, which are periodically
remarketed. We can provide no assurances that the bonds will be remarketed successfully or at reasonable interest rates. Bonds totaling $24.9 million are issued by Illinois American Water, bonds totaling $8.6 million are issued by Arizona American
Water and the remaining $86.9 million of bonds are issued by AWCC. During the months of January and February 2009, AWCC purchased its variable rate demand bonds because no buyer was willing to purchase the bonds at market rates. Although buyers
periodically purchased the bonds from AWCC at market rates during January and February 2009, AWCC holds all $120.3 million in treasury at February 23, 2009. Since the debt has been remarketed for periods no longer than one week and the Company
cannot be certain remarketing will be successful, the debt is included in current portion of long-term debt at December 31, 2008.

At this
time the Company does not believe recent market disruptions will impact its long-term ability to obtain financing. The Company expects to have access to liquidity in the capital markets on favorable terms before the maturity dates of its current
credit facilities and the Company does not expect a significant number of its lenders to default on their commitments thereunder. In addition, the Company can delay major capital investments or pursue financing from other sources to preserve
liquidity, if necessary. The Company believes it can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and fund its minimum required capital investments for an extended period of time.

Regulatory Restrictions

The issuance by the Company
or AWCC of long-term debt or equity securities does not require authorization of any state PUC if no guarantee or pledge of the regulated subsidiaries is utilized. However, state PUC authorization is required to issue long-term debt or equity
securities at most regulated subsidiaries. Our regulated subsidiaries normally obtain the required approvals on a periodic basis to cover their anticipated financing needs for a period of time or in connection with a specific financing.

Under applicable law, our subsidiaries can pay dividends only from retained, undistributed or current earnings. A significant loss recorded at a
subsidiary may limit the dividends that these companies can distribute to us.

Insurance Coverage

We carry various property, casualty and financial insurance policies with limits, deductibles and exclusions consistent with industry standards. However,
insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover



unanticipated losses or claims. We are self-insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained.
Such losses could have a material adverse effect on our short-term and long-term financial condition and the results of operations and cash flows.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments

We enter into obligations with third parties in the ordinary course of
business. These financial obligations, as of December 31, 2008, are set forth in the table below:

Note: The above table reflects only financial obligations and commitments. Therefore, performance obligations
associated with our Non-Regulated Businesses are not included in the above amounts.

(a)

Represents sinking fund obligations and debt maturities.

(b)

Represents expected interest payments on outstanding long-term debt. Amounts reported may differ from actual due to future refinancing of debt.

(c)

Represents future minimum payments under noncancelable capital leases.

(d)

Represents expected interest payments on noncancelable capital leases.

(e)

Represents future minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases, primarily for the lease of motor vehicles, buildings, land and other equipment.

(f)

Represents future payments under water purchase agreements for minimum quantities of water.

(g)

Represents the open purchase orders as of December 31, 2008, for goods and services purchased in the ordinary course of business.

(h)

Represents contributions expected to be made to pension and postretirement benefit plans for the years 2009 through 2013.

(i)

Represents capital expenditures estimated to be required under legal and binding contractual obligations, liability associated with a conservation agreement and an estimate of
advances for construction to be refunded.

Public-Private Partnerships

From 1997 through 2002, WVAWC, entered into a series of agreements with various public entities, which we refer to as the Partners, to establish certain
joint ventures, commonly referred to as “public-private partnerships.” Under the public-private partnerships, the WVAWC constructed utility plant, financed by the WVAWC, and the Partners constructed utility plant (connected to the
WVAWC’s property), financed by the



Partners. WVAWC agreed to transfer and convey some of its real and personal property to the Partners in exchange for an equal principal amount of Industrial
Development Bonds (“IDBs”), issued by the Partners under a state Industrial Development Bond and Commercial Development Act. WVAWC leased back the total facilities, including portions funded by both WVAWC and the Partners, under leases for
a period of 40 years.

WVAWC leased back the transferred facilities under capital leases for a period of 40 years. The leases have
payments that approximate the payments required by the terms of the IDBs. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation Number 39,

Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts,

we have presented the transaction
on a net basis in the consolidated financial statements. The carrying value of the transferred facilities was approximately $161.0 million at December 31, 2008.

Non-Regulated Businesses Performance Obligations

Our Non-Regulated Businesses Contract Operations
Group enters into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the United States military, municipalities and other customers. These military services agreements expire between 2053 and 2059 and have remaining
performance of $1,185.0 million at December 31, 2008. The Operations and Maintenance agreements with municipalities and other customers expire between 2009 and 2038 and have remaining performance commitments as measured by estimated remaining
contract revenue of $1,103.8 million and $1,178.8 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Some of the Company’s long-term contracts to operate and maintain a municipality’s, federal government’s or other party’s
water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities include responsibility for certain major maintenance for some of the facilities, in exchange for an annual fee.

Included in the military services performance commitment at December 31, 2008 are Contracts Operations Group was awarded during September 2008 for operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems at
Army installations at Fort Hood, Texas and Fort Polk, Louisiana. According to the agreements, the awards of the contracts are estimated at approximately $329.0 million and $348.0 million, respectively, over a 50-year period as measured by gross
contract revenue subject to price redeterminations and customary federal contracting termination provisions. Federal contract price redetermination is a mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in subsequent periods to reflect changes in
contract obligations and market conditions.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The application of critical accounting policies is particularly important to our financial condition and results of operations and provides a framework
for management to make significant estimates, assumptions and other judgments. Although our management believes that these estimates, assumptions and other judgments are appropriate, they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Accordingly,
changes in the estimates, assumptions and other judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations as reflected in our consolidated financial statements.

Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow are impacted by the methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical
accounting policies. Management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in
subsequent periods. Our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies, and the estimates and assumptions regarding them, with our audit committee. In addition, our management has also reviewed the following disclosures regarding the
application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee.

Regulatory Accounting

Our regulated utility subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state PUCs and the local governments of the states in which they operate. As such, we
account for these regulated operations in accordance with SFAS No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation,” which we refer to as SFAS No. 71, which requires us to reflect the effects of rate regulation in
our financial statements. Use of SFAS No. 71 is applicable



to utility operations that meet the following criteria: (1) third-party regulation of rates; (2) cost-based rates; and (3) a reasonable
assumption that all costs will be recoverable from customers through rates. As of December 31, 2008, we had concluded that the operations of our regulated subsidiaries meet the criteria. If it is concluded in a future period that a separable
portion of the businesses no longer meets the criteria, we are required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of the business, which would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities
that had been recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Failure to meet the criteria of SFAS No. 71 could materially impact our consolidated financial statements as a one-time extraordinary item and through impacts on continuing
operations.

Regulatory assets represent costs that have been deferred to future periods when it is probable that the regulator will allow
for recovery through rates charged to customers. Regulatory liabilities represent revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred. As of December 31, 2008, we have recorded $919.7 million of net
regulatory assets within our consolidated financial statements. Also, at December 31, 2008, we had recorded $307.3 million of regulatory liabilities within our consolidated financial statements. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information regarding the significant regulatory assets.

For each regulatory jurisdiction where we conduct
business, we continually assess whether the regulatory assets and liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement. This assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in applicable regulatory
environments, recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction, the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation and the ability to recover costs through regulated rates.

Goodwill

The Company’s annual
impairment reviews are performed as of November 30 of each year, in conjunction with the timing of the completion of the Company’s annual strategic business plan. At December 31, 2008, the Company’s goodwill was $1,699.5 million.
The Company also undertakes interim reviews when the Company determines that a triggering event that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value has occurred.

The Company uses a two-step impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be
recognized (if any) in accordance with SFAS No. 142. The step 1 calculation used to identify potential impairment compares the calculated fair value for each of the Company’s reporting units to their respective net carrying values (book
values), including goodwill, on the measurement date. If the fair value of any reporting unit is less than such reporting unit’s carrying value, then step 2 is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss (if any) for such reporting
unit.

The step 2 calculation of the impairment test compares, by reporting unit, the implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying
value of goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is equal to the excess of the fair value of each reporting unit above the fair value of such reporting unit’s identified assets and liabilities. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the
implied fair value of goodwill for any reporting unit, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess (not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill) for that reporting unit.

The determination of the fair value of each reporting unit and the fair value of each reporting unit’s assets and liabilities is performed as of the
measurement date using observable market data before and after the measurement date (if that subsequent information is relevant to the fair value on the measurement date).

For the November 30, 2008 impairment test, the estimated fair value of the regulated reporting unit for step 1 was based on a combination of
the following valuation techniques:

•

observable trading prices of comparable equity securities of publicly-traded water utilities considered by us to be the Company’s peers; and

•

discounted cash flow models developed from the Company’s internal forecasts.



The estimated fair values of the non-regulated reporting units were determined entirely on the basis of discounted cash
flow models.

The first valuation technique applies average peer multiples to the Regulated reporting unit’s historic and forecasted
cash flows. The peer multiples are calculated using the average trading prices of comparable equity securities of publicly-traded water utilities, their published cash flows and forecasts of market price and cash flows for those peers.

The second valuation technique forecasts each reporting unit’s five-year cash flows using an estimated long-term growth rate and discounts these
cash flows at their respective estimated weighted average cost of capital.

If step 2 of the impairment test is required, the Company
determines the fair value of the applicable reporting unit’s assets and liabilities. The fair values for the majority of such assets and liabilities are equal to their carrying values; however, the fair values of the applicable debt are highly
dependent upon market conditions surrounding the measurement date. For the step 2 calculations of the fair value of debt, the Company uses observable prices of instruments and indices that have risks similar to those instruments being valued,
adjusted to compensate for differences in credit profile, collateral, tax treatment and call features, to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit’s debt.

The Company has completed its November 30, 2008 annual impairment review and does not believe that the Company’s goodwill balance was impaired. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will not
be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to the Company’s performance. These market events could include a decline over a period of time of the Company’s stock
price, a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities, the lack of an increase in the Company’s market price consistent with its peer companies, or decreases in control premiums and the overhang effect. A
decline in the forecasted results in our business plan, such as changes in rate case results or capital investment budgets or changes in our interest rates, could also result in an impairment charge. Recognition of impairments of a significant
portion of goodwill would negatively affect the Company’s reported results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain its credit ratings, secure financing on
attractive terms, maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet expectations of our regulators.

In making the determination, we
considered both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the effect of the recent volatility in the equity and debt markets on the Company’s market capitalization. As such, the Company believes that the current valuation technique is
more appropriate than solely relying on the current trading market value of the Company’s common stock.

In reaching our conclusion,
we also made certain assumptions, which we believe to be appropriate, that support the fair value of our reporting units. We considered, in addition to the listed trading price of the Company’s shares, the effect on that price due to RWE’s
majority ownership, the effect of RWE’s expected disposition of its owned Company shares on the market for those shares, the applicability of a control premium to our shares and certain other factors we deemed appropriate. As a result, we
concluded that the Company’s fair value exceeds what we might otherwise have concluded had we relied on market price alone.

In
addition, given recent market conditions, management determined that it was appropriate for the Company to consider the average of the Company’s closing market price over a thirty day period rather than using a particular date to calculate its
market capitalization. The Company’s calculated market capitalization within its 2008 impairment test period was approximately $940.0 million below the aggregate carrying value of its reporting units.

The difference between our calculated market capitalization and the aggregate fair value of our reporting units (which approximates book value) resulted
from the estimated control premium and the estimated impact to the Company’s market capitalization from the overhang created by RWE’s announced plans to divest a substantial portion of its ownership through further public offerings of
stock.



The estimated control premium represents the incremental premium a buyer is willing to pay to acquire a
controlling, majority interest in the Company. In estimating the control premium, management principally considered the current market conditions and historical premiums paid in utility acquisitions observed in the marketplace.

The estimated stock overhang represents the impact on the Company’s share price that we believe results from investor concerns over market price
dilution due to the anticipated increase in the number of the Company’s publicly traded shares caused by the anticipated RWE sale of the Company’s stock. As a condition of certain state regulator approvals for RWE’s sale of the
Company, RWE had agreed to sell 100% of its holdings of Company stock by April 2010 and previously announced its intentions to reduce its interest to below 50% prior to the end of 2008. Management estimated the impact of this overhang condition
using reports from multiple analysts covering the Company’s stock and other available market information.

The determination of our
estimated fair value required the exercise of judgment and is highly sensitive to our assumptions. Our estimated fair values approximate the carrying value of reporting units leaving little estimated value in excess of the required threshold of the
step 1 test. Had the fair value been less than the carrying value of the reporting units, differences between the carrying value and fair value of our long-term debt (which is not taken into account in step 1 but is required in step 2) would have
increased any impairment charge indicated by step 1 by an estimated $300 million, due to accounting guidance that must be followed to measure the implied fair value of goodwill.

For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded impairment charges for goodwill, including discontinued operations, in
the amount of $750.0 million, $509.3 million and $227.8 million, respectively.

As of March 31, 2008, in light of the initial public
offering price and trading levels in our common stock subsequent to the date of the initial public offering, the Company performed an interim impairment test and, on May 9, 2008, management concluded that the carrying value of the
Company’s goodwill was impaired. The Company believed that the initial public offering price was indicative of the value of the Company at March 31, 2008, and accordingly, based on those factors recorded an impairment charge to the
goodwill of its Regulated reporting unit in the amount of $750.0 million as of March 31, 2008. The impairment charge was primarily attributed to the market price of the Company’s common stock (both the initial public offering price and the
price during subsequent trading) being less than the estimate of the initial public offering price used during the 2007 annual test. Also contributing to the impairment was a decline in the fair value of the Company’s debt (due to increased
market interest rates). As a result of the impairment charge, RWE Aqua Holdings GmbH (a wholly-owned subsidiary of RWE) transferred $245.0 million to the Company on May 13, 2008. This cash was used to reduce short-term debt. RWE is not
obligated to make any additional capital contributions.

During the third quarter of 2007, as a result of the Company’s debt being
placed on review for a possible downgrade and the proposed sale of a portion of the Company in the initial public offering, management determined at that time it was appropriate to update its valuation analysis before the next scheduled annual test.
Based on this assessment, the Company performed an interim impairment test and recorded an impairment charge to goodwill related to its Regulated reporting unit in the amount of $243.3 million as of September 30, 2007. The decline was primarily
due to a slightly lower long-term earnings forecast caused by updated customer demand and usage expectations and expectations for timing of capital expenditures and rate recovery.

The Company completed its scheduled annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2007 and determined that an impairment had occurred based upon
information regarding the Company’s market value in connection with the initial public offering. Management determined that the indicative fair value of the Company based on estimates of the initial public offering price range was the best
evidence of the Company’s market value and incorporated this indicated market value into the Company’s valuation methodology, which also considered other items, such as peer multiples, discounted cash flows and a control premium. Based on
the results of the impairment test, an impairment of $266.0 million to the Company’s carrying value was recognized as of December 31, 2007.



The 2006 impairment charge of $227.8 million was attributable to higher interest rates in the Regulated
reporting unit and a change in the potential net realizable value of a non-regulated reporting unit.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets, other than goodwill which is discussed above, include land, buildings, equipment and long-term investments.
Long-lived assets, other than investments and land are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Such
circumstances would include items such as a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or planned to be used or in its physical condition, or a history
of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. In addition, changes in the expected useful life of these long-lived assets may also be an impairment indicator. When such events or changes occur, we estimate the fair value of
the asset from future cash flows expected to result from the use and, if applicable, the eventual disposition of the assets, and compare that to the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value is greater than the fair value, an impairment
loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value. The key variables that must be estimated include assumptions regarding sales volume, rates, operating costs, labor and other benefit costs,
capital additions, assumed discount rates and other economic factors. These variables require significant management judgment and include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events. A variation in the assumptions used could lead
to a different conclusion regarding the realizability of an asset and, thus, could have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements.

The long-lived assets of the regulated utility subsidiaries are grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing as they are integrated state-wide operations that do not have the option to curtail service and
generally have uniform tariffs. A regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery in rates of that asset is no longer probable.

The fair values of long-term investments are dependent on the financial performance and solvency of the entities in which we invest, as well as volatility inherent in the external markets. In assessing potential impairment for these
investments, we consider these factors. If such assets are considered impaired, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value. As a result of fair value analyses, we recorded
pre-tax charge of $0 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues of the regulated utility subsidiaries are recognized as water and wastewater services are
delivered to customers and include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts based on estimated usage from the date of the latest meter reading to the end of the accounting period. Unbilled revenues as of December 31,
2008 and 2007 were $134.2 million and $134.3 million, respectively. Increases in volumes delivered to the utilities’ customers and favorable rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the
calculation of unbilled revenue. Changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the estimated unbilled revenue; however, since the majority of
our customers are billed on a monthly basis, total operating revenues would remain materially unchanged.

Revenue from non-regulated
operations is recognized as services are rendered. Revenues from certain construction projects are recognized over the contract term based on the estimated percentage of completion during the period compared to the total estimated services to be
provided over the entire contract. Losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes probable and estimable. Revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as
unbilled revenue. Billings in excess of revenues recognized on construction contracts are recorded as other current liabilities on the



balance sheet until the recognition criteria are met. Changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to
costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined.

Accounting for Income Taxes

The parent company and its subsidiaries participate in a consolidated federal income tax return for United States tax purposes. Members of the
consolidated group are charged with the amount of federal income tax expense determined as if they filed separate returns.

Certain income
and expense items are accounted for in different time periods for financial reporting than for income tax reporting purposes. The Company provides deferred income taxes on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the
amounts at which they are carried in the financial statements. These deferred income taxes are based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these temporary differences are projected to reverse. In addition, the regulated utility
subsidiaries recognize regulatory assets and liabilities for the effect on revenues expected to be realized as the tax effects of temporary differences, previously flowed through to customers, reverse.

Accounting for Pension and Postretirement Benefits

We maintain noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of our regulated utility and shared service operations. The pension plans have been closed for any employees hired on or after
January 1, 2006. Union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001 and non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2006 will be provided with a 5.25% of base pay defined contribution plan. We also maintain postretirement benefit
plans for eligible retirees. The retiree welfare plans are closed for union employees hired on or after January 1, 2006. The plans had previously closed for non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2002. We follow the guidance of
SFAS 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions,” and SFAS 106, “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions,” when accounting for these benefits. In addition, we adopted the recognition and
disclosure requirements of SFAS 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans,” effective December 31, 2006. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information regarding the accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans.

Accounting for pensions and
other postretirement benefits requires an extensive use of assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, the rate of future compensation increases received by the Company’s employees, mortality, turnover and medical
costs. Each assumption is reviewed annually. The assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy. These
differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the Company recognizes. The primary assumptions are:

•

Discount Rate—The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which are based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the
future. The objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated
benefits when due;

•

Expected Return on Plan Assets—Management projects the future return on plan assets considering prior performance, but primarily based upon the plans’ mix
of assets and expectations for the long-term returns on those asset classes. These projected returns reduce the net benefit costs we record currently;

•

Rate of Compensation Increase—Management projects employees’ annual pay increases, which are used to project employees’ pension benefits at
retirement; and

•

Health Care Cost Trend Rate—Management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care.



In selecting a discount rate for our pension and postretirement benefit plans, a yield curve was
developed for a portfolio containing the majority of United States-issued Aa-graded non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions) corporate bonds. For each plan, the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield
the same present value as using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments. The discount rate for determining pension benefit obligations was 6.12% and 6.27% at December 31, 2008 and 2007 respectively. The discount rate for
determining other post-retirement benefit obligations was 6.09% and 6.20% at December 31, 2008 and 2007 respectively. The discount rate for determining both the pension obligations and other postretirement benefit obligations was 5.90% at
December 31, 2006.

The asset allocation for the Company’s U.S. pension plan at December 31, 2008 and 2007 by asset
category, are as follows:

The investment policy guidelines of the pension plan require that the fixed income portfolio has
an overall weighted average credit rating of AA or better by Standard & Poor’s and the minimum credit quality for fixed income securities must be BBB- or better. Up to 20% of the portfolio may be invested in collateralized mortgage
obligations backed by the United States Government.

The Company’s other postretirement benefit plans are partially funded. The asset
allocation for the Company’s other postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2008 and 2007, by asset category, are as follows:

The Company’s investment policy, and related target asset allocation, is evaluated
periodically through asset liability studies. The studies consider projected cash flows of maturity liabilities, projected asset class return risk, and correlation and risk tolerance.

The pension and postretirement welfare plan trusts investments include debt and equity securities held directly and through commingled funds. The trustee
for the Company’s defined benefit pension and post retirement welfare plans uses independent valuation firms to calculate the fair value of plan assets. Additionally, the company independently verifies the assets values. Approximately 87.2% of
the assets are valued using the quoted market price for the assets in an active market at the measurement date. The remaining 12.8% of the assets are valued using other observable inputs.

In selecting an expected return on plan assets, we considered tax implications, past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held
by the plans. The long-term expected rate of return on plan assets, which we refer to as EROA, assumption used in calculating pension cost was 7.90% for 2008, 8.00% for 2007, and 8.25% for 2006. The weighted average EROA assumption used in
calculating other postretirement benefit costs was 7.75% for 2008, 7.38% for 2007, and 7.95% for 2006.



In selecting a rate of compensation increase, we consider past experience in light of movements in
inflation rates. Our rate of compensation increase was 4.00% for 2008, and 4.25% for 2007 and 2006.

In selecting health care cost trend
rates, we consider past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs. Our health care cost trend rate used to calculate the periodic cost was 8.00% in 2008 gradually declining to 5% in 2014 and thereafter.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. The health care cost
trend rate is based on historical rates and expected market conditions. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

We will use a discount rate and EROA of 6.12% and 7.90%, respectively, for estimating our 2009
pension costs. Additionally, we will use a discount rate and expected return on plan assets of 6.09% and 7.60%, respectively, for estimating our 2009 other postretirement benefit costs. A decrease in the discount rate or the EROA would increases our
pension expense. Our 2008 and 2007 pension and postretirement costs were $51.4 million and $44.9 million, respectively. Based on current plan assets and expected future asset returns, the Company currently estimates the increase to pension and
postretirement expense (net of capitalized amounts) in 2009 to be approximately $32 million, pretax. It is the Company’s intent to work with PUCs in the states in which it operates to minimize the impact of such increases on its results of
operations. The Company currently expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts of $125.2 million, $132.5 million, $124.7 million, $161.9 million and $123.2 million in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013
respectively. Actual amounts contributed could change significantly from these estimates.

The assumptions are reviewed annually and at any
interim remeasurement of the plan obligations. The impact of assumption changes is reflected in the recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts as they occur, or over a period of time if allowed under applicable accounting standards. The
assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy. As these assumptions change from period to period,
recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts and funding requirements could also change.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”). Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) No. 99-20-1, “Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue No. 99-20” (“FSP EITF 99-20-1”). This pronouncement amends EITF 99-20. “Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased
Beneficial Interests and Beneficial Interests That Continue to Be Held by a Transferor in Securitized Financial Assets.” (EITF 99-20), to achieve more consistent determination of whether an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. FSP EITF
99-21-1 also retains and emphasizes the objective of an other than-temporary impairment assessment and the related disclosure requirements in SFAS No. 115 “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” and other
related guidance. FSP EITF 99-20-1 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2008, and is required to be applied prospectively. The adoption of FSP EITF 99-20-1 did not have an impact on the Company’s
results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FAS No. 132(R)-1, “Employers”
Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets” (“FSP FAS 132(R)-1”), which requires additional disclosures for employers’ pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets. As pension and other postretirement benefit
plan assets were not included within the scope of SFAS No. 157, FSP FAS 132(R)-1 requires employers to disclose information about fair value measurements of plan assets similar to the disclosures required under SFAS No. 157, the investment policies
and strategies for the major categories of plan assets, and significant concentrations of risk within plan



assets. FSP FAS 132(R)-1 will be effective for the Registrants as of December 31, 2009. As FSP FAS 132(R)-1 provides only disclosure requirements, the
adoption of this standard will not have an impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

On
October 10, 2008, FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157-3, “Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When a Market for That Asset Is Not Active” (“FSP 157-3”), which clarifies the application of Statement of
Financial accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS 157”) in an inactive market and provides an example to demonstrate how the fair value of a financial asset is determined when the market for that financial
asset is inactive. FSP 157-3 was effective upon issuance, including prior periods of which financial statements had not been issued. The adoption of this standard as of September 30, 2008 did not have an impact on the Company’s results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.

In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position SFAS 157-2 which allows a
one-year deferral of the adoption of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities (such as intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and goodwill) that are required to be measured at fair value on a periodic basis (such as at
acquisition or impairment). The Company elected to use this deferral option and accordingly, only partially adopted SFAS 157 on January 1, 2008. SFAS 157 will be adopted for the Company’s nonfinancial assets and liabilities valued on a
non-recurring basis on January 1, 2009.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157,
“Fair Value Measurements,” which we refer to as SFAS 157. SFAS 157 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles guidance requiring use of fair value, establishes a framework
for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements. On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities, and nonfinancial assets and liabilities with recurring
measurements. The Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period were cash and cash equivalents, restricted funds and short-term debt. These assets and liabilities were measured at fair value on
the balance sheet date using quoted prices in active markets (level 1 inputs, as defined by SFAS 157). The adoption of SFAS 157 for the Company’s financial assets and liabilities did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of
operations, financial position or cash flows. The Company measured the assets of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement welfare plans pursuant to SFAS 157 as of December 31, 2008. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS
157 for the Company’s nonfinancial assets and liabilities will have an impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an Amendment of ARB No. 51,” which we refer to as SFAS 160.
SFAS 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 will be effective for us on January 1, 2009. We do not believe this standard will
have an impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

Also in December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 141(R), “Business Combinations,” which we refer to as SFAS 141(R). SFAS 141(R), which will significantly change the accounting for business combinations, is effective for business
combinations finalized on or after January 1, 2009. As the provisions of SFAS 141(R) are applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date occurs after the guidance becomes effective, the impact to the Company cannot
be determined until the transactions occur. In December 2008, the Company expensed transaction costs of approximately $0.9 million for acquisitions that will not close until after January 1, 2009 and will not be capitalized as goodwill under
the provisions of SFAS 141(R).

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, “The Fair
Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115,” (“ SFAS 159”). This standard permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain
other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without



having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective for years beginning January 1, 2008. The Company has not elected to exercise
the fair value irrevocable option. Therefore, the adoption of SFAS 159 did not have an impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension
and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R),” which we refer to as SFAS 158. This statement requires the recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and other
postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet. Under SFAS 158, actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition obligations and assets that have not been recognized in net periodic benefit cost under previous accounting
standards will be recognized as a regulatory asset for the portion of the underfunded liability that meets the recovery criteria prescribed in SFAS 71 and as accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax effects, for that portion of the
underfunded liability that does not meet SFAS 71 regulatory accounting criteria. We adopted the recognition and disclosure requirements of the statement on December 31, 2006.

In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements,” which we refer to as SAB 108. SAB 108 provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes
of determining whether the current year’s financial statements are materially misstated. SAB 108 was effective for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006.

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” which we refer to as FIN 48, an Interpretation of SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income
Taxes.” FIN 48 is intended to address inconsistencies among entities with the measurement and recognition in accounting for income tax deductions for financial statement purposes. Specifically, FIN 48 addresses the timing of the recognition of
income tax benefits. FIN 48 requires the financial statement recognition of an income tax benefit when we determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2006. We adopted it as required on January 1, 2007, and it did not have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position.

During 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ratified EITF Issue No. 06-3, “How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be
Presented in the Income Statement (that is, Gross versus Net Presentation),” which we refer to as EITF 06-3. The Task Force reached a consensus that the scope of EITF 06-3 includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is both
imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer, and that the presentation of such taxes is an accounting policy that should be disclosed. Our accounting policy is to present these taxes on a
net basis (excluded from revenues).

See Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial
statements for a discussion of new accounting standards recently adopted or pending adoption.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices, equity prices and interest rates. We use a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to reduce interest rate exposure. As of December 31, 2008, a
hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates associated with variable-rate debt would result in a $0.2 million decrease in our pre-tax earnings. Our risks associated with price increases for chemicals, electricity and other commodities are
reduced through long-term contracts and the ability to recover price increases through rates. Non-performance by these commodity suppliers could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.



Our common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on April 23, 2008. The market price of
our common stock may experience fluctuations, many of which are unrelated to our operating performance. In particular, our stock price may be affected by general market movements as well as developments specifically related to the water and
wastewater industry. These could include, among other things, interest rate movements, quarterly variations or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and governmental or regulatory actions. This volatility may make it difficult for us
to access the capital markets in the future through additional offerings of our common stock, regardless of our financial performance, and such difficulty may preclude us from being able to take advantage of certain business opportunities or meet
business obligations.

We are exposed to credit risk through our water, wastewater and other water-related activities for both our
Regulated and Non-Regulated Businesses. Our Regulated Businesses serve residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers while our Non-Regulated Businesses engage in business activities with developers, government entities and other
customers. Our primary credit risk is exposure to customer default on contractual obligations and the associated loss that may be incurred due to the non-payment of customer account receivable balances. Our credit risk is managed through established
credit and collection policies which are in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and involve monitoring of customer exposure and the use of credit risk mitigation measures such as letters of credit or prepayment arrangements. Our
credit portfolio is diversified with no significant customer or industry concentrations. In addition, our Regulated Businesses are generally able to recover all prudently incurred costs including uncollectible customer accounts receivable expenses
and collection costs through rates.

We are also exposed to a potential national economic recession or further deterioration in local
economic conditions in the markets in which we operate. The credit quality of our customer accounts receivable is dependent on the economy and the ability of our customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles and other market changes. In
addition, as a result of the downturn in the economy and heightened sensitivity of the impact of additional rate increases on certain customers, there can be no assurances that regulators will grant sufficient rate authorizations. Therefore our
ability to fully recover operating expense, recover our investment and provide an appropriate return on invested capital made in our Regulated Businesses may be adversely impacted.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA



INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

American Water Works Company,
Inc.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, of changes in
common stockholders’ equity, of comprehensive income (loss) and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of American Water Works Company, Inc. and Subsidiary Companies at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Note 1: Organization and Operation

American Water Works Company, Inc. (“AWW”) and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to herein as the “Company”) is the holding
company for regulated and non-regulated subsidiaries throughout the United States of America and Ontario, Canada. The regulated subsidiaries provide water and wastewater services and, as public utilities, function under rules and regulations
prescribed by state regulators. These regulated subsidiaries have similar long-term economic characteristics and are operationally segregated into the 20 U.S. states in which the Company operates regulated utilities. The non-regulated subsidiaries
include distinctive lines of business including Homeowner Services, which provides water and sewer line protection plans for homeowners, the Operations and Maintenance contracts group, which conducts operation and maintenance of water and wastewater
facilities for municipalities and the U.S. Military, among others, and Carbon Regeneration, which sells granular activated carbon technologies to help remove contaminants and improve the quality of drinking water. The Company is a majority-owned
subsidiary of RWE Aktiengesellschaft (“RWE”) (See Note 9).

Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AWW and its subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions between subsidiaries have been eliminated. The Company uses the equity method to report its investments in two joint venture
investments in each of which the Company holds a 50% voting interest and cannot exercise control over the operations and policies of the investments. Under the equity method, the Company records its interests as an investment and its percentage
share of earnings as earnings or losses of investee.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these
estimates. The Company considers benefit plan assumptions, the carrying values of goodwill and other long-lived assets, including regulatory assets, revenue recognition and accounting for income taxes to be its critical accounting estimates. The
Company’s significant estimates that are particularly sensitive to change in the near term are amounts reported for pension and other postemployment benefits, contingency-related obligations and goodwill.

Regulation

The Company’s regulated utilities
are subject to regulation by the public utility commissions and the local governments of the states in which they operate (the “Regulators”). These Regulators have allowed recovery of costs and credits which the Company has recorded as
regulatory assets and liabilities. Accounting for future recovery of costs and credits as regulatory assets and liabilities is in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of Certain
Types of Regulation” (“SFAS 71”). This statement sets forth the application of generally accepted accounting principles for those companies whose rates are established by or are subject to approval by an independent third-party
regulator. Under SFAS 71, regulated utilities defer costs and credits on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that those costs and credits will be recognized in the rate making process in a period different from
the period in which they would have been reflected in operations by an non-regulated company. These deferred regulatory assets and liabilities are then reflected in the statement of operations in the period in which the costs and credits are
reflected in the rates charged for service.



Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment consist primarily of utility plant. Additions to utility plant and replacements of retirement units of property are capitalized. Costs include material, direct labor and such indirect
items as engineering and supervision, payroll taxes and benefits, transportation and an allowance for funds used during construction. The costs incurred to acquire and internally develop computer software for internal use are capitalized as a unit
of property. The carrying value of these costs amounted to $35,971 and $29,103 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The cost of repairs, maintenance, including planned major maintenance activities, and minor replacements of property is
charged to maintenance expense as incurred.

When units of property are replaced, retired or abandoned, the recorded value thereof is
credited to the asset account and charged to accumulated depreciation. To the extent the Company recovers cost of removal or other retirement costs through rates after the retirement costs are incurred, a regulatory asset is recorded. In some cases,
the Company recovers retirement costs through rates during the life of the associated asset and before the costs are incurred. These amounts result in a regulatory liability being reported based on the amounts previously recovered through customer
rates, until the costs to retire those assets are incurred.

The cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the
straight-line average remaining life method.

Nonutility property consists primarily of buildings and equipment utilized by the Company for
internal operations. This property is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from three to fifty years.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Substantially all cash is
invested in interest-bearing accounts. All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased are considered to be cash equivalents.

The Company had book overdrafts for certain of its disbursement accounts of $42,010 and $42,198 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. A book overdraft represents transactions that have not cleared the bank
accounts at the end of the period. The Company transfers cash on an as-needed basis to fund these items as they clear the bank. The balance of the book overdraft is reported as short-term debt and the change in the book overdraft balance is reported
as cash flows from financing activities.

Restricted Funds

Restricted funds primarily represent proceeds received from financings for the construction and capital improvement of facilities and from customers for future services under operation and maintenance projects. The
proceeds of these financings are held in escrow until the designated expenditures are incurred. Restricted funds expected to be released within 12 months subsequent to year-end are classified as current.

Utility Customer Accounts Receivable

Regulated
utility customer accounts receivable represent amounts billed to water and wastewater customers on a cycle basis. Credit is extended based on the guidelines of the applicable Regulators and generally, collateral is not required.

Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts

Allowances for
uncollectible accounts are maintained for estimated probable losses resulting from the Company’s inability to collect receivables from customers. Accounts that are outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due. A number of
factors are considered in determining the allowance for uncollectible accounts, including the length of time receivables are past due and previous loss history. The Company writes-off accounts when they become uncollectible. (See Note 5)



Non-regulated Trade and Other Receivables, Net

Non-regulated trade and other receivables, net consists of non-regulated trade accounts receivable and non-regulated unbilled revenues, net of a reserve
for doubtful accounts and non-utility customer receivables of the regulated subsidiaries. In determining the reserve for uncollectible non-regulated accounts, the Company considers the length of time the trade accounts receivable are past due and
the customer’s current ability to pay their obligation. Unbilled receivables are accrued when service has been provided but has not been billed to customers. (See Note 6)

Materials and Supplies

Materials and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable
value. Cost is determined using the average cost method.

Goodwill

The Company considers the carrying value of goodwill to be one of its critical accounting estimates. The Company believes the assumptions and other considerations used to value goodwill to be appropriate. However, if
actual experience differs from the assumptions and considerations used in its analysis, the resulting change could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisitions of American Water Works Company, Inc. in 2003 and E’town Corporation in 2001 (the
“Acquisitions”) and has been assigned to reporting units based on the fair values at the date of the Acquisitions. The regulated utility subsidiaries have been aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit as they have similar economic
characteristics. In the non-regulated segment, the business is organized into seven reporting units for its non-regulated services. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets” (“SFAS 142”), goodwill is reviewed annually, or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Annual impairment reviews are performed in the fourth quarter of the calendar
year, in conjunction with the timing of the completion of the Company’s annual strategic business plan.

For each of the years ended
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company determined that its goodwill, including goodwill of discontinued operations, was impaired and recorded impairments of $750,000, $509,345 and $227,802, respectively. (See Note 8)

Long-Lived Assets

The Company considers the carrying
value of long-lived assets to be one of its critical accounting estimates. The Company believes the assumptions and other considerations used to evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets to be appropriate. However, if actual experience
differs from the assumptions and considerations used in its estimates, the resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Long-lived assets, other than goodwill, include land, buildings, equipment and long-term investments. Long-lived assets, other than investments and land, are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, and are
reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Such circumstances would include items such as a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset, a significant
adverse change in the manner the asset is being used or planned to be used or in its physical condition, or a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. In addition, changes in the expected useful life of these
long-lived assets may also be an impairment indicator. When such events or changes occur, the Company estimates the fair value of the asset from future cash flows expected to result from the use and, if applicable, the eventual disposition of the
assets and compares that to the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value is greater than the fair value, an impairment loss is recorded.



The key variables that must be estimated include assumptions regarding sales volume, rates, operating
costs, labor and other benefit costs, capital additions, assumed discount rates and other economic factors. These variables require significant management judgment and include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events. If such
assets are considered impaired, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeds its fair value.

The long-lived assets of the regulated utility subsidiaries are grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing as they are integrated state-wide operations that do not have the option to curtail service and generally have uniform
tariffs. A regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery in rates of that asset is no longer probable.

The Company
holds other investments including investments in privately held companies and investments in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method. The Company’s investments in privately held companies and joint ventures are classified as other
long-term assets.

The fair values of long-term investments are dependent on the financial performance and solvency of the entities in
which the Company invests, as well as volatility inherent in the external markets. If such assets are considered impaired, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value. As a
result of fair value analyses, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $0 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and $750 for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Advances and Contributions in Aid of Construction

Regulated utility subsidiaries may receive advances and contributions from customers, home builders and real estate developers to fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas. Advances for construction are refundable for
limited periods of time as new customers begin to receive service or other contractual obligations are fulfilled. Advances which are no longer refundable are reclassified to contributions in aid of construction. Contributions in aid of construction
are permanent collections of plant assets or cash for a particular construction project. For ratemaking purposes, the amount of such contributions generally serves as a rate base reduction since they represent non-investor supplied funds. Non-cash
utility property has been received, primarily from developers, as advances or contributions of $83,041, $101,226, and $72,892 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Generally, the Company depreciates utility plant funded by contributions and amortizes its contributions balance as a reduction to depreciation expense,
producing a result which is functionally equivalent to reducing the original cost of the utility plant for the contributions. Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries do not depreciate contributed property, based on regulatory guidelines.
Amortization of contributions in aid of construction was $20,219, $20,720 and $16,697 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Recognition of Revenues

Revenues of the regulated utility subsidiaries are recognized as water and wastewater services are
provided and include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts based on estimated usage from the date of the latest meter reading to the end of the accounting period.

The Company has agreements with the United States Government to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems at various military bases pursuant to
50 year contracts (“military agreements”). These contracts also include construction components which are accounted for separately from the operations and management components. The military agreements are subject to periodic price
redetermination adjustments and modifications for changes in circumstance. Additionally, the Company has agreements ranging in length from three to 40 years with various municipalities to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems
(“O&M agreements”). Revenue from operations and management services are recognized as services are provided. (See Note 16)



Construction Contracts

In accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Statement of Position 81-1, “Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production Type Contracts,” revenues
from construction projects are recognized over the contract term based on the estimated percentage of completion during the period compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the entire contract. Losses on contracts are recognized
during the period in which the loss first becomes probable and estimable. Revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenue. Billings in excess of revenues recognized on
construction contracts are recorded as other current liabilities until the recognition criteria are met. Changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in
the period in which revisions are determined.

Under these agreements, revenues were $47,889, $32,141 and $56,069 and operation and
maintenance expenses were $44,227, $34,543 and $53,845 as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Included in the amounts are construction revenues of $25,766 and $12,902 and operation and maintenance expenses of $24,852 and $12,601
related to the Company’s Fillmore contract at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The construction phase of the contract is expected to be completed by December of 2009.

Taxes

The parent company and its subsidiaries participate in a consolidated federal income tax
return for U.S. tax purposes. Members of the consolidated group are charged with the amount of federal income tax expense determined as if they filed separate returns.

Certain income and expense items are accounted for in different time periods for financial reporting than for income tax reporting purposes. The Company provides deferred income taxes on the difference between the tax
basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts at which they are carried in the financial statements. These deferred income taxes are based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these temporary differences are projected to reverse.
In addition, the regulated utility subsidiaries recognize regulatory assets and liabilities for the effect on revenues expected to be realized as the tax effects of temporary differences, previously flowed through to customers, reverse.

Investment tax credits have been deferred by the regulated utility subsidiaries and are being amortized to income over the average estimated service
lives of the related assets.

The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions as a component of income tax
expense.

The Company accounts for sales tax collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities on a net basis.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (“AFUDC”)

AFUDC is a non-cash credit to income with a corresponding charge to utility plant which represents the cost of borrowed funds or a return on equity funds devoted to plant under construction. The regulated utility
subsidiaries record AFUDC to the extent permitted by the Regulators.

Environmental Costs

The Company’s water and wastewater operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign requirements relating to environmental protection, and
as such the Company periodically becomes subject to environmental claims in the normal course of business. Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations or provide a



future benefit are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Remediation costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued, on
an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that these costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated. Remediation costs accrued amounted to $10,538 and $11,000 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Included in these balances were
$10,100 of estimated liabilities pursuant to a conservation agreement entered into by a subsidiary of the Company with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration requiring the Company to, among other provisions, implement certain measures
to protect the steelhead trout and its habitat in the Carmel River watershed in the state of California. The Company pursues recovery of incurred costs through all appropriate means, including regulatory recovery through customer rates. The Company
expects to make an initial payment of $3,500 in April of 2009 and $1,100 annually from July 2010 to July 2016.

New Accounting Standards

In January 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) No. 99-20-1, “Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue No. 99-20” (“FSP EITF 99-20-1”). This pronouncement amends EITF 99-20, “Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased
Beneficial Interests and Beneficial Interests That Continue to Be Held by a Transferor in Securitized Financial Assets” (“EITF 99-20”), to achieve more consistent determination of whether an other-than-temporary impairment has
occurred. FSP EITF 99-20-1 also retains and emphasizes the objective of an other than-temporary impairment assessment and the related disclosure requirements in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 115, “Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” and other related guidance. FSP EITF 99-20-1 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2008, and is required to be applied prospectively. The adoption
of FSP EITF 99-20-1 did not have an impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In December
2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS No. 132(R)-1, “Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets” (“FSP FAS 132(R)-1”), which requires additional disclosures for employers’ pension and other postretirement
benefit plan assets. As pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets were not included within the scope of SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”), FSP FAS 132(R)-1 requires employers to disclose information
about fair value measurements of plan assets similar to the disclosures required under SFAS No. 157, the investment policies and strategies for the major categories of plan assets, and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. FSP FAS
132(R)-1 will be effective for the Company as of December 31, 2009. As FSP FAS 132(R)-1 provides only disclosure requirements, the adoption of this standard will not have an impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or
cash flows.

In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 157-3, “Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When a Market
for That Asset Is Not Active” (“FSP 157-3”), which clarifies the application of SFAS 157 in an inactive market and provides an example to demonstrate how the fair value of a financial asset is determined when the market for that
financial asset is inactive. FSP 157-3 was effective upon issuance, including prior periods for which financial statements had not been issued. The adoption of this standard as of September 30, 2008 did not have an impact on the
Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP SFAS 157-2 which allows
a one-year deferral of adoption of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities (such as intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and goodwill) that are required to be measured at fair value on a periodic basis (such as
at acquisition or impairment). The Company elected to use this deferral option and accordingly, only partially adopted SFAS 157 on January 1, 2008. SFAS 157 will be adopted for the Company’s nonfinancial assets and liabilities valued on a
non-recurring basis on January 1, 2009.

On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 157 for financial assets
and liabilities, and nonfinancial assets and liabilities with recurring measurements. The Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period were cash and cash equivalents, restricted funds and
short-term debt. These assets and liabilities were measured at fair value on the balance sheet date using quoted



prices in active markets (level 1 inputs, as defined by SFAS 157). The adoption of SFAS 157 for the Company’s financial assets and liabilities did not
have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The Company measured the assets of its defined benefit pension and other post retirement welfare plans pursuant to SFAS 157 at December 31,
2008. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS 157 for the Company’s nonfinancial assets and liabilities will have an impact on its results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160 (“SFAS 160”), “Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—An
Amendment of ARB No. 51,” which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2009.
The Company does not believe the standard will have an impact on its results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

In December
2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R) (“SFAS 141(R)”), “Business Combinations,” which will significantly change the accounting for business combinations. SFAS 141(R) is effective for the Company for business
combinations finalized on or after January 1, 2009. In December 2008, the Company expensed transaction costs of approximately $860 for acquisitions that will not close until after January 1, 2009 and will not be capitalized as goodwill
under the provisions of SFAS 141(R).

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities—Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (“SFAS 159”). This standard permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is
to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. This
standard is effective for years beginning January 1, 2008. The Company has not elected to exercise the fair value irrevocable option. Therefore, the adoption of SFAS 159 did not have an impact on the Company’s results of operations,
financial position or cash flows.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined
Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)” (“SFAS 158”). This statement requires the recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and other
postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet. Under SFAS 158, actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition obligations and assets that have not been recognized in net periodic benefit cost under previous accounting
standards will be recognized as a regulatory asset for the portion of the underfunded liability that meets the recovery criteria prescribed in SFAS 71 and as accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax effects, for that portion of the
underfunded liability that does not meet SFAS 71 regulatory accounting criteria. The Company adopted the recognition and disclosure requirements of the statement as of the end of fiscal year 2006.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have
been made to conform previously reported data to the current presentation.

Note 3: Acquisitions

During 2008, the Company closed on acquisitions of 10 regulated water and wastewater systems, for an aggregate purchase price of $12,512, including
transaction costs of $2,622. The purchase price was allocated to the net tangible assets based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date.

During 2007, the Company acquired nine regulated water systems for a total aggregate purchase price of $15,877. Included in this total was the Company’s acquisition on November 1, 2007 of all of the capital
stock of S.J. Services, Inc. (“SJS”) for $13,458. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with SFAS 141. Accordingly, operating results of SJS from November 1, 2007 were included in the Company’s
results of operations. The purchase price was allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets based



upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Total SJS assets acquired were $23,420, including $4,727 of goodwill (See Note 8), and
liabilities assumed totaled $9,962, including long-term debt of $2,791 and contributions in aid of construction of $5,566.

Also during
2007, the Company’s New Jersey subsidiary entered into an agreement with the City of Trenton, New Jersey to purchase the assets of the City’s water system located in the four surrounding townships. The agreement required approval from the
New Jersey Regulator. The initial proposed purchase price of $100,000 was subsequently amended to $75,000; in addition the agreement has been amended to include the provision of technical services from the City over seven years to ensure a smooth
transition of ownership at a total cost of $5,000. The administrative law judge hearing the matter has issued an initial decision (the “Initial Decision”) approving a stipulation of settlement reflecting the changed agreement (the
“Stipulation”) and sent the Initial Decision to the New Jersey Regulator for consideration. On February 25, 2009, a petition seeking a referendum was filed with the City of Trenton. The petition seeks to force the City Council to
reconsider its prior approval of sale, and a vote as to whether the Ordinance approving the sale of the system should go forward or be negated. The Company can provide no assurance as to the outcome of the referendum nor can the Company provide
assurance that the Initial Decision will ultimately be approved by the New Jersey Regulator. Included in the Stipulation, and dependent upon final approval, the Company intends to purchase finished water from the City for the next 20 years under a
water supply agreement. The acquisition is expected to add approximately forty thousand customers to the Company’s customer base. Included in other current assets is a $10,000 refundable deposit the Company made in December 2007 which is being
held in an interest bearing escrow account as required by the bidding process.

Note 4: Utility Plant

The components of utility plant by category at December 31 are as follows:

Utility plant depreciation expense amounted to $267,763 in 2008, $263,737 in 2007 and $249,355 in
2006.

The provision for depreciation expressed as a percentage of the aggregate average depreciable asset balances was 2.93% in 2008,
3.11% in 2007, and 3.14% in 2006.



Note 5: Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts

The following table summarizes the changes in the Company’s allowances for uncollectible accounts:

Note 6: Non-regulated Trade and Other Receivables, Net

Components of the Company’s non-regulated trade and other receivables, net are as follows:

Note 7: Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The regulatory assets represent costs that are expected to be fully recovered from customers in future rates. Except for income taxes, regulatory assets
are excluded from the Company’s rate base and do not earn a return. The components of regulatory assets are as follows:

The Company has recorded a regulatory asset for the additional revenues expected to be realized as
the tax effects of temporary differences previously flowed through to customers reverse. These temporary differences are primarily related to the difference between book and tax depreciation on property placed in service before the adoption by the
regulatory authorities of full normalization for rate making purposes. Full normalization requires no flow through of tax benefits to customers. The regulatory asset for income taxes recoverable through rates is net of the reduction expected in
future revenues as deferred taxes previously provided, attributable to the difference between the state and federal income tax rates under prior law and the current statutory rates, reverse over the average remaining service lives of the related
assets.



Debt expense is amortized over the lives of the respective issues. Call premiums on the redemption of
long-term debt, as well as unamortized debt expense, are deferred and amortized to the extent they will be recovered through future service rates. Expenses of preferred stock issues without sinking fund provisions are amortized over 30 years from
date of issue; expenses of issues with sinking fund provisions are charged to operations as shares are retired.

Pension expense in excess
of the amount contributed to the pension plans is deferred by certain subsidiaries. These costs will be recovered in future service rates as contributions are made to the pension plan. The Company also has regulatory assets of $198,506 and $45,933
at December 31, 2008 and 2007 which is the portion of the underfunded status that is probable of recovery through rates in future periods.

Postretirement benefit expense in excess of the amount recovered in rates through 1997 has been deferred by certain subsidiaries. These costs are recognized in the rates charged for water service and will be fully recovered over a 20-year
period ending in 2012 as authorized by the regulatory authorities. The Company has regulatory assets of $131,300 and $40,012 at December 31, 2008 and 2007 which is the portion of the underfunded status that is probable of recovery through rates
in future periods.

The cost of additional security measures that were implemented to protect facilities after the terrorist attacks on
September 11, 2001 has been deferred by certain subsidiaries. These costs are recognized in the rates charged for water service by certain subsidiaries. These costs are being recovered over periods ranging from five to ten years.

Business services project expenses consist of reengineering and start-up activities for consolidated customer and shared administrative service centers
that began operations in 2001. These costs are recognized in the rates charged for water service by certain subsidiaries.

Tank painting
costs are generally deferred and amortized to current operations on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 5 to 15 years, as authorized by the regulatory authorities in their determination of rates charged for service.

The Company amortizes rate case expenditures over regulatory approved amortization periods, typically three years. Rate case proceeding expenditures
probable of future recovery are deferred.

Purchase premium recoverable through rates is the recovery of the acquisition premiums related
to an asset acquisition by the Company’s California subsidiary during 2002, and acquisitions in 2007 by the Company’s New Jersey subsidiary. As authorized for recovery by the California and New Jersey Regulators, these costs are being
amortized to operations through November 2048.

Environmental remediation recoverable through rates is the recovery of costs incurred by
the Company’s California subsidiary under a settlement agreement entered into with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to improve habitat conditions in the Carmel River Watershed.

Coastal water project costs include all preliminary costs associated with the studying, testing, and design of alternatives to help solve water supply
shortages in Monterey, California. Coastal water project costs incurred through December 31, 2007 have been reviewed and approved for recovery through a surcharge that went into effect January 1, 2007. Costs deferred during 2008 totaled $4,731.
The Company believes it is probable that the costs incurred since the last rate review will also be recoverable.

San Clemente Dam project
costs include deferred costs for the Company’s California subsidiary to investigate alternatives to strengthen or remove the San Clemente Dam due to potential earthquake or flood safety concerns. These cost are not yet in rates, however, the
Company believes it is probable that the costs incurred will be recoverable.



The components of regulatory liabilities are as follows:

Removal costs recovered through rates are retirement costs recovered through customer rates during
the life of the associated assets. In December 2008, the Company’s subsidiary in New Jersey, at the direction of the New Jersey Regulator, began to amortize $48,000 of the total balance into operations via straight line amortization through
November 2048.

Deferred income taxes represent the income tax effect of the adjustment to record the full accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation under SFAS 158.

Other regulatory liabilities include various regulatory balancing accounts.

Note 8: Goodwill

The Company’s annual
impairment reviews are performed as of November 30 of each year, in conjunction with the timing of the completion of the Company’s annual strategic business plan. At November 30, 2008, the Company’s goodwill was $1,704,310.
During December 2008, the Company transferred $4,793 of goodwill to regulatory assets for purchase premiums recoverable through rates, resulting in the $1,699,517 balance outstanding at December 31, 2008, as shown in the table below. The
Company also undertakes interim reviews when the Company determines that a triggering event that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value has occurred.

The Company uses a two-step impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be
recognized (if any) in accordance with SFAS No. 142. The step 1 calculation used to identify potential impairment compares the calculated fair value for each of the Company’s reporting units to their respective net carrying values (book
values), including goodwill, on the measurement date. If the fair value of any reporting unit is less than such reporting unit’s carrying value, then step 2 is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss (if any) for such reporting
unit.

The step 2 calculation of the impairment test compares, by reporting unit, the implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying
value of goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is equal to the excess of the fair value of each reporting unit above the fair value of such reporting unit’s identified assets and liabilities. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the
implied fair value of goodwill for any reporting unit, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess (not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill) for that reporting unit.

The determination of the fair value of each reporting unit and the fair value of each reporting unit’s assets and liabilities is performed as of the
measurement date using observable market data before and after the measurement date (if that subsequent information is relevant to the fair value on the measurement date).

For the November 30, 2008 impairment test, the estimated fair value of the regulated reporting unit for step 1 was based on a combination of
the following valuation techniques:

•

observable trading prices of comparable equity securities of publicly-traded water utilities considered by us to be the Company’s peers; and

•

discounted cash flow models developed from the Company’s internal forecasts.

The estimated fair values of the non-regulated reporting units were determined entirely on the basis of discounted cash flow models.



The first valuation technique applies average peer multiples to the Regulated reporting unit’s
historic and forecasted cash flows. The peer multiples are calculated using the average trading prices of comparable equity securities of publicly-traded water utilities, their published cash flows and forecasts of market price and cash flows for
those peers.

The second valuation technique forecasts each reporting unit’s five-year cash flows using an estimated long-term growth
rate and discounts these cash flows at their respective estimated weighted average cost of capital.

If step 2 of the impairment test is
required, the Company determines the fair value of the applicable reporting unit’s assets and liabilities. The fair values for the majority of such assets and liabilities are equal to their carrying values; however, the fair values of the
applicable debt are highly dependent upon market conditions surrounding the measurement date. For the step 2 calculations of the fair value of debt, the Company uses observable prices of instruments and indices that have risks similar to those
instruments being valued, adjusted to compensate for differences in credit profile, collateral, tax treatment and call features, to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit’s debt.

The Company has completed its November 30, 2008 annual impairment review and does not believe that the Company’s goodwill balance was impaired.
However, there can be no assurances that the Company will not be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to the Company’s performance. These market events could include a
decline over a period of time of the Company’s stock price, a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities, the lack of an increase in the Company’s market price consistent with its peer companies, or
decreases in control premiums and the overhang effect. A decline in the forecasted results in our business plan, such as changes in rate case results or capital investment budgets or changes in our interest rates, could also result in an impairment
charge. Recognition of impairments of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect the Company’s reported results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material and could make it more difficult to
maintain its credit ratings, secure financing on attractive terms, maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet expectations of our regulators.

In making the determination, the Company considered both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the effect of the recent volatility in the equity and debt markets on the Company’s market capitalization. As such, the Company
believes that the current evaluation technique is more appropriate than relying solely on the current trading market value of the Company’s common stock.

In reaching its conclusion, the Company also made certain assumptions, which it believes to be appropriate, that support the fair value of its reporting units. The Company considered, in addition to the listed trading
price of the Company’s shares, the effect on that price due to RWE’s majority ownership, the effect of RWE’s expected disposition of its owned Company shares on the market for those shares, the applicability of a control premium to
the Company’s shares and certain other factors the Company deemed appropriate. As a result, the Company concluded that the Company’s fair value exceeds what the Company might otherwise have concluded had it relied on market price alone.

In addition, given recent market conditions, management determined that it was appropriate for the Company to consider the average of the
Company’s closing market price over a thirty day period rather than using a particular date to calculate its market capitalization. The Company’s calculated market capitalization within its 2008 impairment test period was approximately
$940,000 below the aggregate carrying value of its reporting units.

The difference between the calculated market capitalization and the
aggregate fair value of the reporting units (which approximates book value) resulted from the estimated control premium and the estimated impact to the Company’s market capitalization from the overhang created by RWE’s announced plans to
divest a substantial portion of its ownership through further public offerings of stock.



The estimated control premium represents the incremental premium a buyer is willing to pay to acquire a
controlling, majority interest in the Company. In estimating the control premium, management principally considered the current market conditions and historical premiums paid in utility acquisitions observed in the marketplace.

The estimated stock overhang represents the impact on the Company’s share price that we believe results from investor concerns over market price
dilution due to the anticipated increase in the number of the Company’s publicly traded shares caused by the anticipated RWE sale of the Company’s stock. As a condition of certain state regulator approvals for RWE’s sale of the
Company, RWE had agreed to sell 100% of its holdings of Company stock by April 2010 and previously announced its intentions to reduce its interest to below 50% prior to the end of 2008. Management estimated the impact of this overhang condition
using reports from multiple analysts covering the Company’s stock and other available market information.

The determination of
estimated fair value required the exercise of judgment and is highly sensitive to the Company’s assumptions. The estimated fair values approximate the carrying value of reporting units leaving little estimated value in excess of the required
threshold of the step 1 test. Had the fair value been less than the carrying value of the reporting units, differences between the carrying value and fair value of our long-term debt (which is not taken into account in step 1 but is required in step
2) would have increased any impairment charge indicated by step 1 by an estimated $300,000, due to accounting guidance that must be followed to measure the implied fair value of goodwill.

For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded impairment charges for goodwill, including discontinued operations, in
the amount of $750,000, $509,345 and $227,802, respectively.

As of March 31, 2008, in light of the initial public offering price and
trading levels in the Company’s common stock subsequent to the date of the initial public offering, the Company performed an interim impairment test and, on May 9, 2008, management concluded that the carrying value of the Company’s
goodwill was impaired. The Company believed that the initial public offering price was indicative of the value of the Company at March 31, 2008, and accordingly, based on those factors recorded an impairment charge to the goodwill of its
Regulated reporting unit in the amount of $750,000 as of March 31, 2008. The impairment charge was primarily attributed to the market price of the Company’s common stock (both the initial public offering price and the price during
subsequent trading) being less than the estimate of the initial public offering price used during the 2007 annual test. Also contributing to the impairment was a decline in the fair value of the Company’s debt (due to increased market interest
rates). As a result of the impairment charge, RWE Aqua Holdings GmbH (a wholly-owned subsidiary of RWE) transferred $245,000 to the Company on May 13, 2008. This cash was used to reduce short-term debt. RWE is not obligated to make any
additional capital contributions.

During the third quarter of 2007, as a result of the Company’s debt being placed on review for a
possible downgrade and the proposed sale of a portion of the Company in the initial public offering, management determined at that time it was appropriate to update its valuation analysis before the next scheduled annual test. Based on this
assessment, the Company performed an interim impairment test and recorded an impairment charge to goodwill related to its Regulated reporting unit in the amount of $243,345 as of September 30, 2007. The decline was primarily due to a slightly
lower long-term earnings forecast caused by updated customer demand and usage expectations and expectations for timing of capital expenditures and rate recovery.

The Company completed its scheduled annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2007 and determined an impairment had occurred based upon information regarding the Company’s market value in connection with
the initial public offering. Management determined that the indicative fair value of the Company based on estimates of the initial public offering price range was the best evidence of the Company’s market value and incorporated this indicated
market value into the Company’s valuation methodology, which also considered other items, such as peer multiples, discounted cash flows and a control premium. Based on the results of the impairment test, an impairment of $266,000 to the
Company’s carrying value was recognized as of December 31, 2007.



The 2006 impairment charge of $227,802 was attributable to higher interest rates in the Regulated
reporting unit and a change in the potential net realizable value of a non-regulated reporting unit.

The change in the Company’s
goodwill assets, as allocated between the reporting units is as follows:

(a)

Includes $4,793 of goodwill transferred to regulatory assets in December 2008 for purchase premiums recoverable through rates.

Note 9: Stockholders’ Equity

Common Stock

On April 28, 2008, RWE completed the partial divestiture of its investment in the Company in an IPO through the sale of 58,000 shares of common stock
at an IPO price of $21.50. The selling stockholder granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 8,700 shares of the Company’s stock at a price of $21.50. On May 27, 2008, the Company announced the
underwriters’ partial exercise of their over-allotment option to purchase 5,173 shares to cover over allotments. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares. Prior to the IPO, the Company was an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of RWE. After the IPO, and exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, RWE owns approximately 60% of the Company’s common shares.

Effective the first quarter of 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors’ authorized 50,000 shares of par value $0.01 per share preferred stock. As of December 31, 2008 there are no shares outstanding.

In September of 2008, the Company made a cash dividend payment of $0.20 per share to all common shareholders of record as of
August 15, 2008, amounting to $31,992. In December 2008, the Company made a cash dividend payment of $0.20 per share to all common shareholders of record as of November 18, 2008, amounting to $31,997.

On February 6, 2009, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.20 per share payable on March 2,
2009 to all shareholders of record as of February 18, 2009.

Stock Based Compensation

On April 22, 2008, a subsidiary of RWE contributed 90 shares of the Company’s common stock to the Company and the Company granted 90 restricted stock awards, 269 restricted stock units and 2,078 stock
options. The awards were issued to the Company’s employees and certain non-employee directors under its 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the “2007 Plan”). The total aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be issued
under the 2007 Plan is 6,000. The restricted stock units and the stock options were awarded in two grants with “Grant 1” vesting on January 1, 2010 and “Grant 2” vesting January 1, 2011. Shares issued under the Plan may
be authorized but unissued shares of Company stock or reacquired shares of Company stock, including shares purchased by the Company on the open market for purposes of the 2007 Plan. Additionally during August 2008, the Company granted 5 stock
options and 1 restricted stock unit to newly appointed non-employee directors in two grants vesting on January 1, 2011.

The following
table presents stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007:

There were no significant stock-based compensation costs capitalized during the years ended
December 31, 2008 and 2007.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), “Share Based
Payment” (“SFAS 123(R)”), the cost of services received from employees in exchange for the issuance of stock options and restricted stock awards is required to be measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards issued. The
value of stock options and restricted stock awards at the date of the grant is amortized through expense over the requisite service period using the straight-line method, adjusted for retirement eligible participants. All awards granted in 2008 are
classified as equity.

In addition to the requisite service period, 1,470 stock options and 190 restricted stock units are subject to
performance-based vesting requirements. The performance conditions are based on the achievement of 120% of net income targets in 2008 and 2009. These stock option and restricted stock awards will vest proportionately depending upon the level of
achievement with 1,470 stock options and 190 restricted stock units being the maximum.

The Company recognizes expense for the portion of
the awards where achievement is considered probable. As of December 31, 2008, 757 stock option and 98 restricted stock awards are not considered probable to meet performance conditions.

The Grant 1 performance vesting period ended December 31, 2008 and according to the plan, the Company must certify the level of achievement no later
than 90 days after January 1, 2009. Any portion of the stock options or restricted stock units that do not fully satisfy the performance goals will be forfeited as of the date the level of achievement is certified. In February 2009, 311 stock
options and 39 restricted stock units were forfeited because the performance goals were not fully met.

The Company stratified its grant
populations and used historic employee turnover rates and general market data to estimate employee forfeitures.



On February 20, 2009, the Company granted 1,091 non-qualified stock options and 195 restricted stock
units to certain employees under the 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan. The stock options and restricted stock units vest ratably over a three-year service period from January 1, 2009. The restricted stock units also have market condition
vesting requirements. The stock options expire on December 31, 2015.

Stock Options

Non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock were granted under the 2007 Plan. The exercise price of the stock
options is equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of option grant. Stock options granted become exercisable upon a specified vesting date. The requisite service period for options granted is three years. All stock options
expire seven years from the effective date of the grant. The remaining vesting period of the stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2008 ranged from one to two years. The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

The following table presents the assumptions used in the pricing model for grants and resulting
grant date fair value of stock options granted.

The dividend yield is based on the Company’s expected dividend payments and the IPO stock
price. Expected volatility is based on historic volatilities of traded common stock of peer companies (regulated water companies) over the expected term of the stock options. The risk-free interest rate is the market yield on U.S. Treasury strips
with maturities similar to the expected term of the stock options. The expected term represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the “simplified method” as permitted by Staff Accounting
Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 107 and SAB No. 110.

The following table presents information with respect to stock option
activity as of December 31, 2008.

There are zero option awards vested and no option awards have been exercised as of
December 31, 2008.

As of December 31, 2008, $3,503 of total unrecognized compensation costs related to the nonvested stock
options is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average period of 1.7 years.

Restricted Stock Units

The Company granted restricted stock units under the 2007 Plan. The requisite service period for restricted stock units is three years.



The following table presents information with respect to restricted stock unit activity as of
December 31, 2008.

As these restricted stock units would have paid-out in cash if the IPO had not been completed, the
Company reclassified the restricted stock units from liability-classified awards to equity-classified awards as of the completion of the IPO. As of December 31, 2008, $1,880 of total unrecognized compensation costs related to the nonvested
restricted stock units is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average period of 1.8 years.

If dividends are declared
with respect to the shares of the Company’s common stock during the vesting period of the restricted stock units, the Company credits a liability for the value of the dividends that would have been distributed if the restricted stock units were
shares of Company common stock. When the restricted stock units vest, the Company will pay the employee a lump sum cash payment equal to the value of the dividend equivalents accrued. The Company has recorded a long-term liability of $66 at
December 31, 2008 related to the dividends accrued.

Restricted Stock

The Company granted restricted stock under the 2007 Plan. The requisite service period for the restricted stock is three months.

The following table presents information with respect to restricted stock activity at December 31, 2008.

As of December 31, 2008, the restricted stock was fully vested and there were no unrecognized
compensation costs related to the nonvested restricted stock units. The aggregate intrinsic value of restricted stock awards on the date of vesting was $1,647. The Company recognized an income tax shortfall of $60 at the vesting of these awards.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The
Company’s Nonqualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) was effective as of July 1, 2008. Under the ESPP, employees can use payroll deductions to acquire Company stock at the lesser of 90% of the fair market value as of the
beginning or end of each three-month purchase period. As of December 31, 2008 there were 1,961 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The Company’s ESPP is considered compensatory under SFAS 123(R). Compensation costs
of $172 were recognized for year ended December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, 39 shares were issued from treasury stock under the ESPP.



Note 10: Preferred Stock Without Mandatory Redemption Requirements

Certain preferred stock agreements do not require annual sinking fund payments or redemption except at the option of the subsidiaries and are as follows:

Note 11: Long-Term Debt

The Company primarily incurs long-term debt to fund capital expenditures at the regulated subsidiaries. The components of long-term at December 31 are:

(a)

Variable rate tax-exempt bonds remarketed for periods up to 270 days

(

1 to 119 days during 2008 and 1 to 127 days during 2007). These bonds may be converted to other
short-term variable-rate structures, a fixed-rate structure or subject to redemption. If the remarketing fails and no investors purchase the bonds, the Company is required to purchase the bonds. When the bonds fail to be remarketed to investors, the
Company is obligated to purchase the bonds at par. However the Company intends to remarket the bonds until maturity. During January and February of 2009, AWCC purchased these bonds because no buyer was willing to purchase the bonds at market rates.
Buyers periodically purchased the bonds at market rates during January and February of 2009. Since the debt has been remarketed for periods no longer than one week and the Company cannot be certain remarketing will be successful, the debt is
included in current portion of long-term debt at December 31, 2008. As of February 23, 2009, AWCC held all the bonds in treasury.

(b)

Bonds included in current portion of long-term debt at December 31, 2008. $24,860 of the total represents variable rate tax-exempt bonds which are remarketed every
7 days. These bonds may be converted to other



short-term variable-rate structures, a fixed-rate structure or subject to redemption. The remaining $8,560 represents variable rate tax-exempt bonds
remarketed as for periods up to 270 days. See (a) above.

(c)

Includes capital lease obligations of $1,829 and $1,982 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Lease payments of $171, $193, $215, $237, $122 and $891 will be made in
2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and thereafter, respectively.

(d)

Includes fair value adjustments previously recognized in acquisition purchase accounting.

All the subsidiaries’ mortgage bonds and $791,390 of the subsidiaries’ private activity bonds and government funded debt is collateralized by
utility plant.

Long-term debt indentures contain a number of covenants that, among other things, limit, subject to certain exceptions, the
Company from issuing debt secured by the Company’s assets. Certain long term notes require the Company to maintain a ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization of not more than 0.70 to 1.00. In addition, the
Company has $1,104,902 of notes which include the right to redeem the notes in whole or in part from time to time subject to certain restrictions.

In 2007, the Company borrowed $1,750,000 from RWE and used the proceeds to redeem $1,750,000 of its 5.9% mandatory redeemable preferred stock.

Also during 2007, the Company issued senior notes in the principal amount of $2,117,000 and received equity contributions from RWE in the amount of $1,067,092. The Company used the proceeds from the senior notes and
equity contributions to repay long-term and short-term RWE notes, repay outstanding commercial paper and for other corporate purposes amounting to $2,011,530, $624,446 and $548,116, respectively.

A portion of the RWE notes that were redeemed in 2007 were obtained for the use of certain of the Company’s regulated subsidiaries. These notes were
redeemed early resulting in a difference of $8,655 between the book value of the RWE notes and the cash consideration required to extinguish the notes. As agreed with the applicable Regulators, the difference on extinguishment was deferred as a
regulatory liability by the Company’s regulated subsidiaries and will be amortized to Interest, net over the remaining lives of the original RWE notes for periods ranging from 2014 to 2034. The amount amortized was $1,044 in 2008 and $531 in
2007.

The future sinking fund payments and maturities are as follows:

The following long-term debt was issued in 2008:



The following long-term debt and preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements were repurchased
or retired through optional redemption or payment at maturity during 2008:

Other subsidiaries fixed rate bonds and notes redemptions includes $2,832 of debt assumed by the
purchaser in the Felton water system asset sale.

The $144,725 of senior notes redeemed in 2008 are held in treasury and can be
re-marketed.

Gains from early extinguishment of debt included in Interest, net amounted to $0, $13,113 and $3,739 in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

Interest, net includes interest income of approximately $5,690, $10,985, and $4,254 at December 31, 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively.

On February 4, 2009, American Water Capital Corp., the Company’s financing subsidiary, completed its public
offering of $75,000 of 8.25% Senior Monthly Notes due 2038. The net proceeds of the offering were used to repay short term debt.

Note 12: Short-Term

AWCC has entered into an $840,000 senior unsecured credit facility syndicated among the following group
of 11 banks with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. acting as administrative agent:

This revolving credit facility is principally used to support the commercial paper program at AWCC
and to provide up to $150,000 million in letters of credit. On September 15, 2008, a majority of the banks agreed to further extend $685,000 of commitments under this revolving credit facility to September 15, 2013. On December 18,
2008, The Bank of New York Mellon joined the credit facility syndicate with a commitment amount of $40,000 through September 15, 2012. If any lender defaults in its obligation to fund advances, the Company may request the other lenders to
assume the default lender’s commitment or replace such defaulting lender by designating an assignee willing to assume the commitment, however the remaining lenders have no obligation to assume a defaulting lender’s commitment and we can
provide no assurances that we will replace a defaulting lender.

At December 31, AWCC had the following sub-limits and available
capacity under the credit facility.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had $49,230 of outstanding letters of credit, $43,903 of which
was issued under the revolving credit facility noted above.

The following table presents the short-term borrowing activity for AWCC for
2008 and 2007:

Interest rates on advances under the credit facility are based on either prime or the London
Interbank Offering Rate (“LIBOR”) plus an applicable margin based upon credit ratings of the Company, as well as total outstanding amounts under the agreement at the time of the borrowing. The maximum LIBOR margin is 55 basis points.



The credit facility requires the Company to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated
capitalization of not more than 0.70 to 1.00. The ratio at December 31, 2008 was 0.56 to 1.00.

None of the Company’s borrowings are
subject to default or prepayment as a result of a downgrading of securities, although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under the Company’s credit facilities.

As part of the normal course of business, the Company routinely enters contracts for the purchase and sale of water, energy, fuels and other services.
These contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit the Company and our counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and
applicable contract law, if the Company is downgraded by a credit rating agency, especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a
demand for adequate assurance of future performance. Depending on its net position with a counterparty, the demand could be for the posting of collateral. In the absence of expressly agreed provisions that specify the collateral that must be
provided, the obligation to supply the collateral requested will be a function of the facts and circumstances of the Company’s situation at the time of the demand. If the Company can reasonably claim that it is willing and financially able to
perform its obligations, it may be possible to successfully argue that no collateral should be posted or that only an amount equal to two or three months of future payments should be sufficient. The Company does not expect to post any collateral
which will have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

AWCC has entered
into a one year $10,000 committed revolving line of credit with PNC Bank, N.A. This line of credit will terminate on December 31, 2009 unless extended and is used primarily for short-term working capital needs. Interest rates on advances under
this line of credit are based on either the prime rate of the financial institution or the applicable LIBOR rate for the term selected plus 200 basis points.

Note 13: General Taxes

Components of general tax expense from continuing operations for the years presented are as follows:



Note 14: Income Taxes

Components of income tax expense from continuing operations for the years presented are as follows:

A reconciliation of income tax expense from continuing operations at the statutory federal income
tax rate to actual income tax expense is as follows:



The following table provides the components of the net deferred tax liability from continuing operations
at December 31:

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded federal net operating loss
(“NOL”) carryforwards of $239,654 and $91,554, respectively. The Company believes the federal NOL carryforwards are more likely than not to be recovered and require no valuation allowance. The Company evaluated its ability to fully utilize
the existing federal NOL carryforwards in light of the partial ownership change by RWE. Under Internal Revenue Code (“I.R.C.”) Section 382, an ownership change occurs if there is a greater than fifty percent (50%) change in equity
ownership of a company over a three year period determined by reference to the ownership of persons holding five percent (5%) or more of that company’s equity securities. If a company undergoes an ownership change as defined by I.R.C. Section
382, the company’s ability to utilize its pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset post-change income may be limited.

The Company
believes that the limitation imposed by I.R.C. Section 382 generally should not preclude use of its federal NOL carryforwards, assuming the Company has sufficient taxable income in future carryforward periods to utilize those NOL carryforwards. The
Company’s federal NOL carryforwards do not begin expiring until 2025.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded state
NOL’s of $431,694 and $381,623, respectively, the majority of which are offset by a valuation allowance because the Company does not believe these NOL’s are more likely than not to be realized because the state NOL carryforwards began
expiring in 2008.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had Canadian NOL carryforwards of $17,528 and $20,155, respectively. The
majority of these carryforwards are offset by a valuation allowance because the Company does not believe these NOL’s are more likely than not to be realized because the Canadian NOL carryforwards began expiring in 2008.



At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had capital loss carryforwards for federal income tax
purposes of $17,614 and $19,977, respectively. The Company has recognized a full valuation allowance for the capital loss carryforwards because the Company does not believe these losses are more likely than not to be recovered.

The Company files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the
Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local or non-U.S income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2003.

During 2006, the Company filed federal refund claims with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). The majority of the Company’s refund claims were attributable to the carry back of NOL’s generated in 2003. The refund
claims procedurally required approval by the Joint Committee of Taxation (“JCT”). The Company received notification from the IRS outlining their final findings from the audit to which the Company and IRS agreed. In the fourth quarter of
2008, the Company received approximately $28,652 in refunds excluding interest of $6,317.

The Company has state income tax examinations in
progress and does not expect material adjustments to result.

The Company adopted FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. The adoption did
not have any impact to the Company’s opening balance of accumulated deficit in 2007 because the positions taken were adequately reserved. The Company’s gross FIN 48 liability, excluding interest and penalties, for unrecognized tax benefits
decreased during 2008 as follows:

The liability balance as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 does not include interest and penalties of
$312 and $341, respectively, which is recorded as a component of income tax expense. The Company does not anticipate material changes to its unrecognized tax benefits within the next year. If the Company sustains all of its positions at December 31,
2008 and 2007, an unrecognized tax benefit of $1,104 and $1,396, respectively, excluding interest and penalties, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate.

Note 15: Employee Benefits

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

The Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible non-union employees of its regulated utility and shared services
operations. Benefits under the plans are based on the employee’s years of service and compensation. The pension plans have been closed for any employees hired on or after January 1, 2006. Union employees hired on or after January 1,
2001 had their accrued benefit frozen and will be able to receive this benefit as a lump sum upon termination or retirement. Union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001 and non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2006 are
provided with a 5.25% of base pay defined contribution plan.

The Company’s funding policy is to contribute at least the minimum
amount required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Pension plan assets are invested in a number of investments including equity and bond mutual funds, fixed income securities and guaranteed interest contracts with insurance
companies.



Pension expense in excess of the amount contributed to the pension plans is deferred by certain regulated
subsidiaries pending future recovery in rates charged for utility services as contributions are made to the plans. (See Note 7)

The
Company also has several unfunded noncontributory supplemental non-qualified pension plans that provide additional retirement benefits to certain employees.

The Company maintains postretirement benefit plans providing varying levels of medical and life insurance to eligible retirees. The retiree welfare plans are closed for union employees hired on or after
January 1, 2006. The plans had previously closed for non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2002.

The Company’s
policy is to fund postretirement benefit costs accrued. Plan assets are invested in equity and bond mutual funds.

The obligations of the
plans are dominated by obligations for active employees. Because the timing of expected benefit payments is so far in the future and the size of the plan assets are small relative to the Company’s assets, the investment strategy is to allocate
a large portion of assets to equities, which the Company believes will provide the highest return over the long-term period. The fixed income assets are invested in long duration debt securities in order to better match the duration of the plan
liability.

The liabilities of the pension and other postretirement benefit plans were adjusted to their fair value at the time of the
Acquisitions.

The Company periodically conducts an asset liability modeling study to ensure the investment strategy is aligned with the
profile of the obligations. The long-term goals are to maximize the plan funded status and minimize contributions and pension expense, while taking into account the potential volatility risks on each of these items.

None of the Company’s securities are included in pension or other postretirement benefit plan assets. Combined plan assets of the benefit
plan’s include approximately $500 of RWE securities at December 31, 2008.

The asset allocation for the Company’s U.S.
pension plan at December 31, 2008 and 2007 by asset category, are as follows:

The investment policy guidelines of the pension plan require that the fixed income portfolio has
an overall weighted average credit rating of AA or better by Standard & Poor’s and the minimum credit quality for fixed income securities must be BBB- or better. Up to 20% of the portfolio may be invested in collateralized mortgage
obligations backed by the United States Government.

The Company’s other postretirement benefit plans are partially funded. The asset
allocation for the Company’s other postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2008 and 2007, by asset category, are as follows:



The postretirement benefit plan assets are invested in a manner consistent with the pension plan
investment policy.

The following table provides a rollforward of the changes in the benefit obligation and plan assets for the most recent
two years for all plans combined:

The following table provides the components of the Company’s accumulated other comprehensive
income and regulatory assets that have not been recognized as components of periodic benefit costs as of December 31.



At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and
fair value of plan assets for pension plans with a projected obligation in excess of plan assets were as follows:

The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation exceeds plan assets for all of the
Company’s other postretirement benefit plans.

In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act (“PPA”) was signed into law in the
U.S. The PPA replaces the funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans by requiring that defined benefit plans contribute to a 100% of the current liability funding target over 7 years. Defined benefit plans with a funding status of less
than 80% of the current liability are defined as being “at risk” and additional funding requirements and benefit restrictions may apply. The PPA was effective for the 2008 plan year with short-term phase-in provisions for both the funding
target and at-risk determination. The Company’s qualified defined benefit plan is currently funded above the at-risk threshold, and therefore the Company expects that the plans will not be subject to the “at risk” funding requirements
of the PPA. The Company is proactively monitoring the plan’s funded status and projected contributions under the new law to appropriately manage the potential impact on cash requirements.

Minimum funding requirements for qualified defined benefit pension plans are determined by government regulations and not by accounting pronouncements.
The Company plans to contribute at least amounts equal to the minimum required contributions in 2009 to the qualified pension plans. The Company plans to contribute its 2009 other postretirement benefit cost to its Voluntary Employee’s Benefit
Association Trust.

Information about the expected cash flows for the pension and postretirement benefit plans is as follows:

The Company made 2009 contributions to fund pension benefits and other benefits of $17,100 and
$10,409, respectively through February 2009.

The following table reflects the net benefits expected to be paid from the plan assets or the
Company’s assets:



Because the above amounts are net benefits, plan participants’ contributions have been excluded from
the expected benefits.

Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits requires an extensive use of assumptions about the
discount rate, expected return on plan assets, the rate of future compensation increases received by the Company’s employees, mortality, turnover and medical costs. Each assumption is reviewed annually. The assumptions are selected to represent
the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy. These differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense
that the Company recognizes.

The significant assumptions related to the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are
as follows:

N/A—Assumption is not applicable.

The discount rate assumption was determined for the pension and postretirement benefit
plans independently. A yield curve was developed for a universe containing the majority of U.S.—issued Aa—graded corporate bonds, all of which were non callable (or callable with make-whole provisions). For each plan, the discount rate was
developed as the level equivalent rate that would produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plans’ investment portfolios. Assumed projected rates of
return for each of the plans’ projected asset classes were selected after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of the returns and volatility of the various asset classes. Based on the target asset allocation for each asset
class, the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio was developed, adjusted for historical and expected experience of active portfolio management results compared to the benchmark returns and for the effect of expenses paid from plan
assets. The Company’s pension expense increases as the expected return on assets decreases.



Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the other
postretirement benefit plans. The health care cost trend rate is based on historical rates and expected market conditions. A one -percentage -point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

The following table provides the components of net periodic benefit costs for the years ended December 31:



The Company’s policy is to recognize curtailments when the total expected future service of plan
participants is reduced by greater than 10% due to an event that results in terminations and/or retirements. The Company reflected curtailments in 2006 due to a significant number of aggregate terminations and retirements at one of its subsidiaries.

The estimated amounts that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income and regulatory assets into net periodic benefit
cost in 2009 are as follows:

Savings Plans for Employees

The Company maintains 401(k) savings plans that allow employees to save for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. Employees can make contributions that are invested at their direction in one or more funds. The Company
makes matching contributions based on a percentage of an employee’s contribution, subject to certain limitations. Due to the Company’s discontinuing new entrants into the defined benefit pension plan, on January 1, 2006 the Company
began providing an additional 5.25% of base pay defined contribution benefit for union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001 and non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2006. The Company expensed contributions to the plans
totaling $7,789 for 2008, $7,305 for 2007 and $6,898 for 2006. All of the Company’s contributions are invested in one or more funds at the direction of the employee.

Long-Term Incentive Plan

The Company participated in a RWE long-term incentive plan for executives
(“RWE LTIP”). Under the RWE LTIP, Company employees were granted 120,004 performance shares of RWE common stock which vested over three years beginning January 1, 2005. Subject to the vesting provisions, the performance shares were
payable in cash. In accordance with SFAS 123(R), the performance shares were accounted for as a liability. Participants received their awards in cash in 2008. No expense was recognized related to these shares during 2008 and no liability remains at
December 31, 2008. The Company recorded a liability of $8,398 related to the performance shares at December 31, 2007, which was included in Other current liabilities. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company
recognized approximately $4,127 and $2,604, respectively, of share-based compensation expense related to the performance shares in operation and maintenance expense.

Retention Bonuses

The Company established a retention bonus program that was intended to retain
employees in key leadership roles through the timely completion of the IPO. If a participant remained employed by the Company through March 31, 2008, the participant received a cash bonus based on a predetermined percentage of his or her base
salary in effect on January 1, 2006, or his or her hire date, if he or she was hired after January 1, 2006. Participants received their awards in cash in 2008. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, the Company
recognized approximately $455, $2,498, and $2,907, respectively, of expense related to the retention bonuses in operation and maintenance expense.

Completion Bonuses

The Company offered a completion bonus to reward selected senior executives for their contributions to
the IPO process. Each eligible executive was entitled to receive a cash bonus based on a predetermined percentage of



his or her base salary in effect on December 31, 2007, or his or her hire date, if he or she was hired after January 1, 2006. Participants received
their awards in cash in 2008. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, the Company recognized approximately $749, $832, and $1,750, respectively, of expense related to the completion bonuses in operation and maintenance expense.

Note 16: Commitments and Contingencies

OMI/Thames Water Stockton, Inc. (“OMI/TW”) is a 50/50 joint venture between a subsidiary of the Company and Operations Management International, Inc. (“OMI”). In February 2003, OMI/TW and the City of Stockton California
(the “City”) entered into a 20-year service contract for capital improvements and management services of water, wastewater and storm water utilities. By mutual agreement, OMI/TW and the City of Stockton terminated the contract effective
February 29, 2008 (the “Termination Date”). Upon termination, responsibility for management and operation of the system was returned to the City. OMI/TW agreed to provide a limited twelve-month warranty relating to certain components
of the facilities that OMI/TW constructed (the “WW39 Plant”), which expired on December 31, 2008. OMI/TW also agreed to correct any latent defects relating to significant deficiencies in the structural components of certain capital
improvements discovered prior to November 15, 2009, if any. Additionally OMI/TW committed to pay for certain employee transition costs and assumed financial responsibility for regulatory fines levied through the Termination Date, if any,
resulting from OMI/TW’s failure to comply with applicable National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit requirements and/or incidents traced to design defects in the WW39 Plant. During 2007, the California State Water Resources Control
Board issued a notice of violation and a corresponding Settlement Communication related to a discharge into an adjacent river. OMI/TW is responsible for any fines that may result from the Settlement Communication. Given the uncertainties related to
resolving the remaining issues described above and financial settlement with OMI, the Company has a loss reserve of approximately $1,300 and $4,000 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The Company, through a subsidiary, holds a 50% interest in American Water-Acciona Agua LLC (formerly American Water-Pridesa LLC) (“AW-Acciona”)
a Delaware limited liability company. Acciona Agua Corporation (USA) holds the remaining 50% interest. In December 2007, AW-Acciona completed construction of a water filtration plant for total construction costs of approximately $32,000. Generally,
as part of the contractual terms relating to construction contracts, the Company provides a one-year construction warranty period. As of December 31, 2008, no claims have been made related to this warranty which expired November 27, 2008.

The Company is also routinely involved in condemnation proceedings and legal actions incident to the normal conduct of its business. At
December 31, 2008, the Company has accrued approximately $4,600 as probable costs and it is reasonably possible that additional losses could range up to $21,500 for these matters. For certain matters, the Company is unable to estimate possible
losses. The Company believes that damages or settlements, if any, recovered by plaintiffs in such claims or actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

The Company enters into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the United States military, municipalities and
other customers. The Company’s military services agreements expire between 2053 and 2059 and have remaining performance commitments as measured by estimated remaining contract revenue of $1,184,999 and $496,872 at December 31, 2008 and
2007, respectively. The Company’s Operations and Maintenance agreements with municipalities and other customers expire between 2009 and 2038 and have remaining performance commitments as measured by estimated remaining contract revenue of
$1,103,839 and $1,178,778 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Some of the Company’s long-term contracts to operate and maintain a municipality’s, federal government’s or other party’s water or wastewater treatment
and delivery facilities include responsibility for certain major maintenance for some of those facilities, in exchange for an annual fee. Unless specifically required to perform certain maintenance activities, the maintenance costs are recognized
when the maintenance is performed.



Included in the military services performance commitment at December 31, 2008 are contracts the
Company was awarded during September 2008 for operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems at Army installations at Fort Hood, Texas and Fort Polk, Louisiana. According to the agreements, the awards of the contracts are estimated at
approximately $329,000 and $348,000, respectively, over a 50-year period as measured by gross contract revenue subject to price redeterminations and customary federal contracting termination provisions. Federal contract price redetermination is a
mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in subsequent periods to reflect changes in contract obligations and market conditions.

Commitments have been made in connection with certain construction programs. The estimated capital expenditures required under legal and binding contractual obligations amounted to $268,989 at December 31, 2008.

The Company’s regulated subsidiaries maintain agreements with other water purveyors for the purchase of water to supplement their water supply. The
Company’s subsidiaries purchased water expense under these types of agreements amounted to approximately $95,739, $92,403, and $85,345 during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The estimated annual commitment
related to the minimum quantities of water purchased is expected to approximate $44,938 in 2009, $45,910 in 2010, $46,673 in 2011, $47,636 in 2012, $43,031 in 2013 and $533,635 thereafter.

Note 17: Net Loss per Common Share

Basic net loss
per common share, loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, per common share and loss from continuing operations per common share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Outstanding shares consist of issued shares
less treasury stock. Diluted net loss per common share, loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, per common share and loss from continuing operations per common share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents related to the restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options and the employee stock purchase plan. The dilutive effect of restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options,
and the employee stock purchase plan is calculated using the treasury stock method and expected proceeds on vesting of the restricted stock and restricted stock units, exercise of the stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase
plan. The following table sets forth the components of basic and diluted earnings per share and shows the effect of the common stock equivalents on the weighted average number of shares outstanding used in calculating diluted earnings per share:

Options to purchase 926 shares of the Company’s common stock, 119 restricted stock units, and
33 shares under the employee stock purchase plan were excluded from the calculation of diluted common shares outstanding because they are anti-dilutive at December 31, 2008. There were also 1,134 stock options and 148 restricted stock units
which were excluded from the calculation of diluted common shares outstanding because certain performance conditions were not satisfied as of December 31, 2008. The Company had no potentially dilutive shares for the years ending December 31,
2007 and 2006, respectively.



On November 5, 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized 500,000 shares of common
stock, par value $.01 per share and declared a one hundred and sixty thousand-for-one common stock split effective November 7, 2007 for all common shares outstanding. The Company’s par value of $1.00 per share changed to $.01 per share and
$1,599 was transferred from paid-in capital to common stock to record the split. All share and per share data for all periods presented have been restated to give effect to the stock split.

Note 18: Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The
following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments.

Current
assets and current liabilities: The carrying amount reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for current assets and current liabilities, including revolving credit debt due to the short-term maturities and variable interest rates, approximates
their fair values.

Preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements and long-term debt: The fair values of preferred stock with
mandatory redemption requirements and long-term debt are determined by a valuation model which is based on a conventional discounted cash flow methodology and utilizes assumptions of current market rates. As a majority of the Company’s debts do
not trade in active markets, the Company calculated a base yield curve using a risk-free rate (a US Treasury securities yield curve) plus a credit spread that is based on the following two factors: an average of the Company’s own
publicly-traded debt securities and the current market rates for US Utility BBB+ debt securities. The Company used these yield curve assumptions to derive a base yield and then adjusted the base yield for specific features of the debt securities of
call features, coupon tax treatment and collateral.

The carrying amounts (including fair value adjustments previously recognized in
acquisition purchase accounting) and fair values of the financial instruments at December 31 are as follows:

Adoption of SFAS 157

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company partially adopted SFAS No. 157, which primarily requires expanded disclosure for assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. As permitted by FSP FAS
157-2, the Company has elected to defer the adoption of the nonrecurring fair value measurement disclosures of nonfinancial assets and liabilities, such as goodwill and asset retirement obligations until January 1, 2009.

To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels as follows:

•

Level 1—quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access as of the reporting date.
Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs include active exchange-traded equity securities, exchange-based derivatives, mutual funds and money market funds.



•

Level 2—inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through
corroboration with observable market data. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include fixed income securities, non-exchanged-based derivatives, commingled investment funds not subject to purchase and sale restrictions and
fair-value hedges.

•

Level 3—unobservable inputs, such as internally-developed pricing models for the asset or liability due to little or no market activity for the asset or
liability. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs include infrequently-traded non-exchange-based derivatives and commingled investment funds subject to purchase and sale restrictions.

Recurring Fair Value Measurements

The following
table presents assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and their level within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2008:

Restricted funds – The Company’s restricted funds primarily represent proceeds received
from financings for the construction and capital improvement of facilities and from customers for future services under operations and maintenance projects. The proceeds of these financings are held in escrow until the designated expenditures are
incurred. Restricted funds expected to be released within twelve months subsequent to year-end are classified as current.

Rabbi trust
investments – The Company’s rabbi trust investments consist primarily of fixed income investments from which supplemental executive retirement plan benefits are paid. The Company includes these assets in other long-term assets.

Deposits – Deposits includes escrow funds and certain other deposits held in trust. The Company includes cash deposits in other current assets.

Deferred compensation obligations – The Company’s deferred compensation plans allow participants to defer certain cash
compensation into notional investment accounts. The Company includes such plans in other long-term liabilities. The value of the Company’s deferred compensation obligations is based on the market value of the participants’ notional
investment accounts. The notional investments are comprised primarily of mutual funds, which are based on observable market prices.

Note 19: Operating
Leases

The Company has entered into operating leases involving certain facilities and equipment. Rental expenses under operating leases
were $36,200 for 2008, $34,946 for 2007 and $36,136 for 2006. The operating leases for



facilities will expire over the next 20 years and the operating leases for equipment will expire over the next five years. Certain operating leases have
renewal options ranging from one to five years.

At December 31, 2008, the minimum annual future rental commitment under operating
leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year are $32,342 in 2009, $28,474 in 2010, $22,313 in 2011, $16,836 in 2012, $12,144 in 2013 and $122,904 thereafter.

The Company has a series of agreements with various public entities (the “Partners”) to establish certain joint ventures, commonly referred to
as “public-private partnerships”. Under the public-private partnerships, the Company constructed utility plant, financed by the Company, and the Partners constructed utility plant (connected to the Company’s property), financed by the
Partners. The Company agreed to transfer and convey some of its real and personal property to the Partners in exchange for an equal principal amount of Industrial Development Bonds (“IDBs”), issued by the Partners under a state Industrial
Development Bond and Commercial Development Act. The Company leased back the total facilities, including portions funded by both the Company and the Partners, under leases for a period of 40 years.

The leases related to the portion of the facilities funded by the Company have required payments from the Company to the Partners that approximate the
payments required by the terms of the IDBs from the Partners to the Company (as the holder of the IDBs). As the ownership of the portion of the facilities constructed by the Company will revert back to the Company at the end of the lease, the
Company has recorded these as capital leases. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation Number 39, “Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts”, the lease obligation and the receivable of the principal
amount of the IDBs is presented by the Company on a net basis. The carrying value of the facilities funded by the Company recognized as a capital lease asset was $160,997 and $161,803 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, which is presented
within Utility Plant. The future payments under the lease obligation are equal to and offset by the payments receivable under the IDBs.

At
December 31, 2008, the minimum annual future rental commitment under the operating leases for the portion of the facilities funded by the Partners that have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year included in the
proceeding minimum annual rental commitments are $3,477 in 2009, $3,497 in 2010, $3,500 in 2011 through 2013, and $103,348 thereafter.

Note 20: Related
Party Transactions

The Company’s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflects expense
allocations for some central corporate functions historically provided by Thames Water, including information systems, human resources, accounting and treasury activities and legal services. These allocations reflect expenses specifically
identifiable as relating to the Company’s business as well as the Company’s share of expenses allocated based on capital employed, capital expenditures, headcount, revenues, production volumes, fixed costs, environmental accruals or other
methods management considers to be reasonable. During the transition to a separate, stand-alone company, the Company has developed or obtained additional in-house capabilities related to these functions, and therefore there were no such expense
allocations in 2008 or in 2007 from RWE or its affiliates.

Thames Water Plc, formerly an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of RWE,
provided certain management services to the Company which amounted to $0 in 2008 and 2007 and $1,386 in 2006.

Thames Water International
Services Limited, formerly an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of RWE, provided services of expatriate employees to the Company which amounted to $0 in 2008 and 2007 and $1,763 in 2006.

Interest on the Company’s borrowings with RWE amounted to $0, $26,797, and $131,005 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.



TWILUX, an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of RWE, was the holder of $1,750,000 of the
Company’s preferred stock. Preferred dividends included in interest expense amounted to $0, $74,569, and $103,270 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The preferred stock was redeemed in 2007 utilizing the proceeds from $1,750,000 in variable
rate borrowings from RWE. The variable rate borrowings from RWE were subsequently redeemed with proceeds from the senior notes issuance. (See Note 11)

The Company maintains agreements with both public and private water providers for the purchase of water to supplement water supply, particularly during periods of peak demand. The President and CEO of the Company is a
Commissioner of one of these water providers. The Company purchased approximately $16,150, $16,793, and $16,374 of water from this provider in the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The minimum purchase quantity amounts
are known and the rates are set annually. Assuming an annual inflationary rate adjustment of 3.5%, the estimated commitments related to the minimum quantities of purchased water under these agreements are $15,448 in 2009, $15,988 in 2010, $16,548 in
2011, $17,127 in 2012, $17,726 in 2013 and $284,096 thereafter.

Note 21: Discontinued Operations

Based on management’s ongoing evaluation of the non-regulated businesses, it was determined that the Company’s U.S. Residuals and Underground
businesses were not meeting growth expectations and were not considered core businesses of the Company’s operations. Accordingly, the Company sold these businesses. As a result of these sales, the Company recorded a net gain/loss of $0 in 2008
and 2007 and a net loss of $1,001 in 2006.

In 2006, the Company sold a group of assets of the Residuals business for $2,500 and reported
the related operations within discontinued operations. In June 2007, the Company sold another component of Residuals business for $9,660. The Company completed the sale of this component in 2007.

The Company’s Underground business was sold for $27,651 in 2006. As a result of the sale, the Company recorded a loss of $1,001 in 2006.

A summary of discontinued operations presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations include the following:

There were no assets or liabilities classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheets at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.



Note 22: Segment Information

The Company has two operating segments which are also the Company’s two reportable segments referred to as the Regulated Businesses and Non-regulated Businesses segments. The Company’s chief operating
decision maker regularly reviews the operating results of the Regulated and Non-regulated Businesses segments to assess segment performance and allocate resources. The evaluation of segment performance and the allocation of resources are based on
several measures. The measure that is most consistent with that used by management is adjusted earnings before interest and income taxes from continuing operations (“Adjusted EBIT”). Management has grouped the Company’s businesses
into its Regulated and Non-regulated Businesses segments based upon the products and services they provide and whether they function under the rules and regulations of the public utility regulatory environment.

The Regulated Businesses segment includes the Company’s 23 utility subsidiaries that provide water and wastewater services to customers in 20 U.S.
states. With the exception of one company, each of these public utility subsidiaries is subject to regulation by public utility commissions and local governments. In addition to providing similar products and services and being subject to the public
utility regulatory environment, each of the regulated subsidiaries has similar economic characteristics, production processes, types and classes of customers and water distribution or wastewater collection processes. Each of these companies is also
subject to both federal and state regulation regarding the quality of water distributed and the discharge of wastewater residuals.

The
Non-regulated Businesses segment is comprised of non-regulated businesses that provide a broad range of non-regulated water and wastewater services and products including homeowner water and sewer line maintenance services, water and wastewater
facility operations and maintenance services, granular carbon technologies and products for cleansing water and wastewater, wastewater residuals management services and water and wastewater facility engineering services.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies (see Note 2). The Regulated and
Non-regulated Businesses segment information includes intercompany costs that are allocated by American Water Works Service Company, Inc. and intercompany interest that is charged by AWCC, which are eliminated to reconcile to the consolidated
results of operations. Inter-segment revenues, which are primarily recorded at cost plus mark-up that approximates current market prices, include carbon regeneration services and leased office space, furniture and equipment provided by the
Company’s non-regulated subsidiaries to its regulated subsidiaries. Other includes corporate costs which are not allocated to the Company’s subsidiaries, eliminations of inter-segment transactions, and fair value adjustments and associated
income and deductions related to the Acquisitions which have not been allocated to the segments for evaluation of segment performance and allocation of resource purposes. The adjustments related to the Acquisitions are reported in Other, as they are
excluded from segment performance measures evaluated by management. The following table includes the Company’s summarized segment information:



(1)

Management evaluates the performance of its segments and allocates resources based on several factors, of which the primary measure is Adjusted EBIT. Adjusted EBIT does not
represent cash flow for periods presented and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a source of liquidity. Adjusted EBIT as defined
by the Company may not be comparable with Adjusted EBIT as defined by other companies.

The following table reconciles
Adjusted EBIT, as defined by the Company, to loss from continuing operations before income taxes:



Note 23: Felton Water System Asset Sale

In September of 2008, the Company’s California subsidiary completed its transfer of ownership of the Felton water system to the San Lorenzo Valley
Water District (“SLVWD”). Under the terms of the agreement, SLVWD paid $13,400 for the operating assets of the water system that serves approximately 1,330 customers. The payment included a $10,568 cash payment and the assumption of $2,832
in debt. Including goodwill, the Company recognized a loss of $381 on the sale of these assets. (See Note 8)



Note 24: Unaudited Quarterly Data

The following table sets forth certain supplemental unaudited consolidated quarterly financial data for each of the twelve quarters in the period ended
December 31, 2008. The operating results for any quarter are not indicative of results that may be expected for a full year or any future periods.

Amounts may not sum due to rounding.

Income (loss) from continuing operations includes impairment losses of $750,000, $266,000 and $243,345 in the first quarter of 2008, fourth quarter of
2007 and third quarter of 2007, respectively.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of
Disclosure Controls and Procedures

American Water Works Company, Inc. maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“the Exchange Act”)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.

The Company was not required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 (“Section 404”) and related SEC rules and regulations to perform an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008. While we were not required to conduct a Section 404
evaluation, as of December 31, 2008, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to controls over maintenance of contracts and agreements. Specifically, effective controls did not exist to ensure the
accuracy and completeness of accounting and disclosure for such contracts and agreements.



Such deficiency could result in misstated consolidated financial statements affecting results of
operations, financial position, cash flows and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of
deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

As a result of this material weakness, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2008. Nevertheless, management has concluded that the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results
of operations and cash flows as of the dates, and for the periods, presented, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”).

Due to a transition period established by the rules of the SEC for newly public companies, this Annual Report does not include a report of
management’s assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or attestation report of the company’s registered public accounting firm.

Plan for Remediation of Material Weakness

We believe that we have taken the appropriate
actions to remediate the material weakness described above by (1) conducting training on controls over maintenance of contracts and agreements for personnel, (2) hiring additional resources, and (3) designing and implementing new policies,
procedures and controls. We believe this material weakness will remain until we have had sufficient experience with the sustainability of the controls at the levels at which they have been operating as of December 31, 2008.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2008 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
