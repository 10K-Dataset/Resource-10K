PART I

Item 1.  Business

OVERVIEW

NEE is one of the largest electric power and energy infrastructure companies in North America and a leader in the renewable energy industry. NEE has two principal businesses, FPL and NEER. FPL is the largest electric utility in the state of Florida and one of the largest electric utilities in the U.S. FPL’s strategic focus is centered on investing in generation, transmission and distribution facilities to continue to deliver on its value proposition of low bills, high reliability, outstanding customer service and clean energy solutions for the benefit of its nearly five million customers. NEER is the world's largest operator of wind and solar projects. NEER’s strategic focus is centered on the development, construction and operation of long-term contracted assets throughout the U.S. and Canada, including renewable generation facilities, natural gas pipelines and battery storage projects.

As described in more detail in the following sections, NEE seeks to create value in its two principal businesses by meeting its customers' needs more economically and more reliably than its competitors. NEE's strategy has resulted in profitable growth over sustained periods at both FPL and NEER. Management seeks to grow each business in a manner consistent with the varying opportunities available to it; however, management believes that the diversification and balance represented by FPL and NEER is a valuable characteristic of the enterprise and recognizes that each business contributes to NEE's financial strength in different ways. FPL and NEER share a common platform with the objective of lowering costs and creating efficiencies for their businesses. NEE and its subsidiaries continue to develop and implement enterprise-wide initiatives focused on improving productivity, process effectiveness and quality.

NEE, which employed approximately 14,000 people at December 31, 2017, was incorporated in 1984 under the laws of Florida. NEE conducts its operations principally through its two wholly owned subsidiaries, FPL and NEER, which also constitute NEE's reportable segments for financial reporting purposes. See Note 14 for certain financial information about these segments. NEECH, another wholly owned subsidiary of NEE, owns and provides funding for NEER's and NEE's operating subsidiaries, other than FPL. NEP was formed in 2014. NEP acquires, manages and owns contracted clean energy projects with stable, long-term cash flows. See NEER section below for further discussion of NEP, including changes to its governance structure, which resulted in the deconsolidation of NEP in January 2018.



FPL

FPL was incorporated under the laws of Florida in 1925 and is a rate-regulated electric utility engaged primarily in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electric energy in Florida. FPL is the largest electric utility in the state of Florida and one of the largest electric utilities in the U.S. At

December 31, 2017

, FPL had approximately 26,600 MW of net generating capacity, approximately 75,000 circuit miles of transmission and distribution lines and approximately 620 substations. FPL provides service to its customers through an integrated transmission and distribution system that links its generation facilities to its customers. At

December 31, 2017

, FPL served approximately ten million people through nearly

five million

customer accounts. FPL's service territory, which covers most of the east and lower west coasts of Florida, and plant locations at

December 31, 2017

were as follows (see FPL Sources of Generation below):



CUSTOMERS AND REVENUE

FPL's primary source of operating revenues is from its retail customer base; it also serves a limited number of wholesale customers within Florida. The percentage of FPL's operating revenues and customer accounts

by customer class were as follows:

For both retail and wholesale customers, the prices (or rates) that FPL may charge are approved by regulatory bodies, by the FPSC in the case of retail customers, and by the FERC in the case of wholesale customers. In general, under U.S. and Florida law, regulated rates are intended to cover the cost of providing service, including a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Since the regulatory bodies have authority to determine the relevant cost of providing service and the appropriate rate of return on capital employed, there can be no guarantee that FPL will be able to earn any particular rate of return or recover all of its costs through regulated rates. See FPL Regulation below.

FPL seeks to maintain attractive rates for its customers. Since rates are largely cost-based, maintaining low rates requires a strategy focused on developing and maintaining a low-cost position, including the implementation of ideas generated from cost savings initiatives. A common benchmark used in the electric power industry for comparing rates across companies is the price of 1,000 kWh of consumption per month for a residential customer. FPL's


average bill for 1,000 kWh of monthly residential usage was well below both the average of reporting electric utilities within Florida and the July


national average (the latest date for which this data is available) as indicated below:



FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS AND COMPETITION

FPL's service to its retail customers is provided primarily under franchise agreements negotiated with municipalities or counties. During the term of a franchise agreement, which is typically 30 years, the municipality or county agrees not to form its own utility, and FPL has the right to offer electric service to residents. FPL currently holds


franchise agreements with various municipalities and counties in Florida with varying expiration dates through

2048. These franchise agreements cover approximately 88%

of FPL's retail customer base in Florida. FPL also provides service to 12

other municipalities and to 22

unincorporated areas within its service area without franchise agreements pursuant to the general obligation to serve as a public utility. FPL relies upon Florida law for access to public rights of way.

Because any customer may elect to provide his/her own electric services, FPL effectively must compete for an individual customer's business. As a practical matter, few customers provide their own service at the present time since FPL's cost of service is lower than the cost of self-generation for the vast majority of customers. Changing technology, economic conditions and other factors could alter the favorable relative cost position that FPL currently enjoys; however, FPL seeks as a matter of strategy to ensure that it delivers superior value, in the form of low customer bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service.

In addition to self-generation by residential, commercial and industrial customers, FPL also faces competition from other suppliers of electrical energy to wholesale customers and from alternative energy sources. In each of 2017, 2016 and 2015, operating revenues from wholesale and industrial customers combined represented approximately five percent of FPL's total operating revenues.

For the building of new steam and solar generating capacity of 75 MW or greater, the FPSC requires investor-owned electric utilities, including FPL, to issue a request for proposal (RFP) except when the FPSC determines that an exception from the RFP process is in the public interest. The RFP process allows independent power producers and others to bid to supply the new generating capacity. If a bidder has the most cost-effective alternative, meets other criteria such as financial viability and demonstrates adequate expertise and experience in building and/or operating generating capacity of the type proposed, the investor-owned electric utility would seek to negotiate a purchased power agreement with the selected bidder and request that the FPSC approve the terms of the purchased power agreement and, if appropriate, provide the required authorization for the construction of the bidder's generating capacity.

FPL SOURCES OF GENERATION

At

December 31, 2017

, FPL's resources for serving load consisted of

27,067 MW, of which 26,578 MW were from FPL-owned facilities and approximately 489 MW were available through purchased power agreements. FPL owned and operated 34

units that used fossil fuels, primarily natural gas, with generating capacity of 21,978 MW and had joint ownership interests in 3 coal units, which it does not operate, with net generating capacity of 888 MW. In addition, FPL owned, or had undivided interests in, and operated, 4 nuclear units with net generating capacity totaling 3,453 MW

(see Nuclear Operations below) and owned and operated

5 solar generation facilities with generating capacity totaling 259 MW

(excluding 75 MW of non-incremental solar capability which is provided through a natural gas generation facility). FPL customer usage and operating revenues are typically higher during the summer months, largely due to the prevalent use of air conditioning in FPL's service territory. Occasionally, unusually cold temperatures during the winter months result in significant increases in electricity usage for short periods of time.

In January 2018, the St. Johns River Power Park coal units (SJRPP), in which FPL had a 20% ownership interest (254 MW), were shut down. This shutdown had the effect of terminating FPL’s 375 MW take-or-pay purchased power contract with JEA, the joint owner of SJRPP (see Note 13 - Contracts).



Fuel Sources

FPL relies upon a mix of fuel sources for its generation facilities, the ability of some of its generation facilities to operate on both natural gas and oil, and on purchased power to maintain the flexibility to achieve a more economical fuel mix in order to respond to market and industry developments.

*Oil is less than 1%

*Oil and Solar are collectively less than 1%

Significant Fuel and Transportation Contracts.

At

December 31, 2017

, FPL had the following significant fuel and transportation contracts in place:

•

FPL has firm transportation contracts with seven different transportation suppliers for natural gas pipeline capacity for an aggregate maximum delivery quantity of 2,769,000 MMBtu/day currently, of which 1,969,000 MMBtu/day have expiration dates ranging from 2018 to 2036. The remaining 800,000 MMBtu/day increases to 1,200,000 MMBtu/day starting in mid-2020 through 2042.

See Note 13 - Contracts.

•

FPL has several contracts for the supply of uranium and the conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel with expiration dates ranging from March 2018 through 2033.

•

Additionally, FPL enters into short- and medium-term natural gas supply contracts to provide a portion of FPL's anticipated needs for natural gas. The remainder of FPL's natural gas requirements is purchased in the spot market.

Nuclear Operations

At

December 31, 2017

, FPL owned, or had undivided interests in, and operated the four nuclear units in Florida discussed below. FPL's nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate planned refueling and maintenance outages, including inspections, repairs and certain other modifications. Scheduled nuclear refueling outages typically require the unit to be removed from service for variable lengths of time.

______________________

(a)

Excludes 147 MW operated by FPL but owned by non-affiliates.

(b)

In January 2018, FPL filed an application with the NRC to renew the operating licenses for Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 for an additional 20 years, which license renewals are pending.

NRC regulations require FPL to submit a plan for decontamination and decommissioning five years before the projected end of plant operation. FPL's current plans, under the existing operating licenses, provide for prompt dismantlement of Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 with decommissioning activities commencing in 2032 and 2033, respectively. Current plans provide for St. Lucie Unit No. 1 to be shut down in 2036 with decommissioning activities to be integrated with the prompt dismantlement of St. Lucie Unit No. 2 commencing in 2043.



FPL's nuclear facilities use both on-site storage pools and dry storage casks to store spent nuclear fuel generated by these facilities, which are expected to provide sufficient storage of spent nuclear fuel at these facilities through license expiration.

FPL ENERGY MARKETING AND TRADING

FPL's Energy Marketing & Trading division (EMT) buys and sells wholesale energy commodities, such as natural gas, oil and electricity. EMT procures natural gas and oil for FPL's use in power generation and sells excess natural gas, oil and electricity. EMT also uses derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity. Substantially all of the results of EMT's activities are passed through to customers in the fuel or capacity clauses. See Management's Discussion - Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk Sensitivity and Note 3.

FPL REGULATION

FPL's operations are subject to regulation by a number of federal, state and other organizations, including, but not limited to, the following:

•

the FPSC, which has jurisdiction over retail rates, service territory, issuances of securities, planning, siting and construction of facilities, among other things;

•

the FERC, which oversees the acquisition and disposition of generation, transmission and other facilities, transmission of electricity and natural gas in interstate commerce, proposals to build and operate interstate natural gas pipelines and storage facilities, and wholesale purchases and sales of electric energy, among other things;

•

the NERC, which, through its regional entities, establishes and enforces mandatory reliability standards, subject to approval by the FERC, to ensure the reliability of the U.S. electric transmission and generation system and to prevent major system blackouts;

•

the NRC, which has jurisdiction over the operation of nuclear power plants through the issuance of operating licenses, rules, regulations and orders; and

•

the EPA, which has the responsibility to maintain and enforce national standards under a variety of environmental laws, in some cases delegating authority to state agencies. The EPA also works with industries and all levels of government, including federal and state governments, in a wide variety of voluntary pollution prevention programs and energy conservation efforts.

FPL Rate Regulation

The FPSC sets rates at a level that is intended to allow FPL the opportunity to collect from retail customers total revenues (revenue requirements) equal to FPL's cost of providing service, including a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. To accomplish this, the FPSC uses various ratemaking mechanisms, including, among other things, base rates and cost recovery clauses.

Base Rates

.

In general, the basic costs of providing electric service, other than fuel and certain other costs, are recovered through base rates, which are designed to recover the costs of constructing, operating and maintaining the utility system. These basic costs include O&M expenses, depreciation and taxes, as well as a return on FPL's investment in assets used and useful in providing electric service (rate base). At the time base rates are established, the allowed rate of return on rate base approximates the FPSC's determination of FPL's estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which includes its costs for outstanding debt and an allowed ROE. The FPSC monitors FPL's actual regulatory ROE through a surveillance report that is filed monthly by FPL with the FPSC. The FPSC does not provide assurance that any regulatory ROE will be achieved. Base rates are determined in rate proceedings or through negotiated settlements of those proceedings. Proceedings can occur at the initiative of FPL or upon action by the FPSC. Base rates remain in effect until new base rates are approved by the FPSC.

Rates Effective January 2017 through December 2020

- In December 2016, the FPSC issued a final order approving a stipulation and settlement between FPL and several intervenors in FPL's base rate proceeding (2016 rate agreement). Key elements of the 2016 rate agreement, which is effective from January 2017 through at least December 2020, include, among other things, the following:

•

New retail base rates and charges were established resulting in the following increases in annualized retail base revenues:

◦

$400 million beginning January 1, 2017;

◦

$211 million beginning January 1, 2018; and

◦

$200 million when a new approximately 1,750 MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle unit in Okeechobee County, Florida (Okeechobee Clean Energy Center) achieves commercial operation, which is expected to occur in mid-2019.

•

In addition, FPL is eligible to receive, subject to conditions specified in the 2016 rate agreement, base rate increases associated with the addition of up to 300 MW annually of new solar generation in each of 2017 through 2020 and may carry forward any unused MW to subsequent years during the term of the 2016 rate agreement. Approximately 300 MW of new solar generating capacity became operational in January 2018. An additional 300 MW is expected to be operational by March 2018 and in both of 2019 and 2020. FPL will be required to demonstrate that any proposed solar facilities are cost effective and scheduled to be in service before December 31, 2021. FPL has agreed to an installed cost cap of $1,750 per kW.



•

FPL's allowed regulatory ROE is 10.55%, with a range of 9.60% to 11.60%. If FPL's earned regulatory ROE falls below 9.60%, FPL may seek retail base rate relief. If the earned regulatory ROE rises above 11.60%, any party other than FPL may seek a review of FPL's retail base rates.

•

Subject to certain conditions, FPL may amortize, over the term of the 2016 rate agreement, up to $1.0 billion of depreciation reserve surplus plus the reserve amount remaining under FPL's 2012 rate agreement discussed below (approximately $250 million), provided that in any year of the 2016 rate agreement, FPL must amortize at least enough reserve to maintain a 9.60% earned regulatory ROE but may not amortize any reserve that would result in an earned regulatory ROE in excess of 11.60%. See Note 1 - Securitized Storm-Recovery Costs, Storm Fund and Storm Reserve for discussion of the reserve amortization impact following the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (tax reform).

•

Future storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an interim basis beginning 60 days from the filing of a cost recovery petition, but capped at an amount that could produce a surcharge of no more than $4 for every 1,000 kWh of usage on residential bills during the first 12 months of cost recovery. Any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years. If storm restoration costs exceed $800 million in any given calendar year, FPL may request an increase to the $4 surcharge to recover amounts above $400 million. See Note 1 - Securitized Storm-Recovery Costs, Storm Fund and Storm Reserve.

In January 2017, the Sierra Club filed a notice of appeal challenging the FPSC’s final order approving the 2016 rate agreement, which notice of appeal is pending before the Florida Supreme Court.

Rates Effective January 2013 through December 2016 -

Effective January 2013, pursuant to an FPSC final order approving a stipulation and settlement between FPL and several intervenors in FPL's base rate proceeding (2012 rate agreement), new retail base rates and charges for FPL were established resulting in an increase in retail base revenues of $350 million on an annualized basis. The 2012 rate agreement, provided for, among other things, the following:

•

a regulatory ROE of 10.50% with a range of plus or minus 100 basis points;

•

an increase in annualized base revenue requirements as each of three FPL modernized power plants became operational in April 2013, April 2014 and April 2016;

•

the continuation of cost recovery through the capacity clause (reported as retail base revenues) for a generating unit which was placed in service in May 2011 (beginning January 2017, under the 2016 rate agreement, cost recovery is through base rates);

•

subject to certain conditions, the right to reduce depreciation expense up to $400 million (reserve), provided that in any year of the 2012 rate agreement, FPL was required to amortize enough reserve to maintain an earned regulatory ROE within the range of 9.50% to 11.50% (the reserve amount was reduced by $30 million to up to $370 million as a result of a settlement in August 2015 related to the purchase of a 250 MW coal-fired generation facility located in Jacksonville, Florida (Cedar Bay generation facility), which FPL retired in December 2016);

•

an interim cost recovery mechanism for storm restoration costs (see Note 1 - Securitized Storm-Recovery Costs, Storm Fund and Storm Reserve); and

•

an incentive mechanism whereby customers receive 100% of certain gains, including but not limited to gains from the purchase and sale of electricity and natural gas (including transportation and storage), up to a specified threshold; gains exceeding that specified threshold were shared by FPL and its customers.

Cost Recovery Clauses

.

Cost recovery clauses are designed to permit full recovery of certain costs and provide a return on certain assets allowed to be recovered through the various clauses. Cost recovery clause costs are recovered through levelized monthly charges per kWh or kW, depending on the customer's rate class. These cost recovery clause charges are calculated at least annually based on estimated costs and estimated customer usage for the following year, plus or minus true-up adjustments to reflect the estimated over or under recovery of costs for the current and prior periods. An adjustment to the levelized charges may be approved during the course of a year to reflect revised estimates. FPL recovers costs from customers through the following clauses:

•

Fuel - fuel costs and energy charges relating to purchased power agreements, the most significant of the cost recovery clauses in terms of operating revenues (see Note 1 - Rate Regulation);

•

Capacity - primarily capacity payments to non-utility generators and other utilities and certain costs associated with the acquisition of certain generation facilities (see Note 1 - Rate Regulation and Note 13 - Contracts);

•

Energy Conservation - costs associated with implementing energy conservation programs; and

•

Environmental - certain costs of complying with federal, state and local environmental regulations enacted after April 1993 and costs associated with three of FPL's solar facilities placed in service prior to 2016.

The FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred. These costs may include, among others, fuel and O&M expenses, the cost of replacing power lost when fossil and nuclear units are unavailable, storm restoration costs and costs associated with the construction or acquisition of new facilities.



FERC

The Federal Power Act grants the FERC exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity and natural gas in interstate commerce. Pursuant to the Federal Power Act, electric utilities must maintain tariffs and rate schedules on file with the FERC which govern the rates, terms and conditions for the provision of FERC-jurisdictional wholesale power and transmission services. The Federal Power Act also gives the FERC authority to certify and oversee a national electric reliability organization with authority to establish and independently enforce mandatory reliability standards applicable to all users, owners and operators of the bulk-power system. See NERC below. Electric utilities are subject to accounting, record-keeping and reporting requirements administered by the FERC. The FERC also places certain limitations on transactions between electric utilities and their affiliates.

NERC

The NERC has been certified by the FERC as the national electric reliability organization. The NERC's mandate is to ensure the reliability and security of the North American bulk-power system through the establishment and enforcement of reliability standards approved by FERC. The NERC's regional entities also enforce reliability standards approved by the FERC. FPL is subject to these reliability standards and incurs costs to ensure compliance with continually heightened requirements, and can incur significant penalties for failing to comply with them.

FPL Environmental Regulation

FPL is subject to environmental laws and regulations as described in the NEE Environmental Matters section below. FPL expects to seek recovery through the environmental clause for compliance costs associated with any new environmental laws and regulations.

FPL EMPLOYEES

FPL had approximately 8,700 employees at

December 31, 2017

, with approximately 34% of these employees represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) under a collective bargaining agreement with FPL that expires October 31, 2020.

NEER

NEER, a limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware, was formed in 1998 to aggregate NEE's competitive energy businesses. NEER is a diversified clean energy company with a business strategy that emphasizes the development, construction and operation of long-term contracted assets with a focus on renewable projects. Through its subsidiaries, NEER currently owns, develops, constructs, manages and operates electric generation facilities in wholesale energy markets primarily in the U.S., as well as in Canada and Spain. See Note 14 for information on revenues from foreign sources and long–lived assets located in foreign countries. NEER, with approximately

19,060

MW of total net generating capacity at

December 31, 2017

, is one of the largest wholesale generators of electric power in the U.S., with approximately

18,180

MW of net generating capacity across 32 states, and has


MW of net generating capacity in 4 Canadian provinces and

99.8

MW of net generating capacity in Spain. At

December 31, 2017

,

NEER operates facilities with a total generating capacity of

20,950

MW. NEER produces the majority of its electricity from clean and renewable sources as described more fully below. NEER is the world's largest operator of wind and solar projects based on 2017 MWh produced. NEER develops and builds battery storage projects, which when combined with its renewable projects, serves to enhance its ability to meet customer needs for a firm generation source. NEER also owned and operated approximately 205 substations and 1,190 circuit miles of transmission lines at

December 31, 2017

.

NEER also engages in energy-related commodity marketing and trading activities, including entering into financial and physical contracts, primarily to hedge the production from its generation assets that is not sold under long-term power supply agreements. These contracts primarily include power and gas commodities and their related products, as well as provide full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities in certain markets and offer customized power and gas and related risk management services to wholesale customers. In addition, NEER participates in natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil production primarily through non-operating ownership interests, and in pipeline infrastructure development, construction, management and operations, through either wholly owned subsidiaries or noncontrolling or joint venture interests, hereafter referred to as the gas infrastructure business. NEER also hedges the expected output from its gas infrastructure production assets to protect against price movements.

NEP

- As discussed in the Overview above, NEP was formed in 2014. NEP acquires, manages and owns contracted clean energy projects with stable, long-term cash flows through a limited partner interest in NEP OpCo. Through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, NEE owns 101,440,000 common units of NEP OpCo representing a noncontrolling interest in NEP's operating projects of approximately 65.1% at

December 31, 2017

.

At

December 31, 2017

, NEE owned a controlling general partner interest in NEP and consolidated NEP for financial reporting purposes (see below for discussion of deconsolidation of NEP). At

December 31, 2017

, through the combination of NEER's contribution of energy projects to NEP OpCo in connection with NEP’s IPO in July 2014 and subsequent acquisitions of additional energy projects, NEP owned, or had an interest in, a portfolio of


wind and solar projects with generating capacity totaling approximately

3,728

MW and long-term contracted natural gas pipeline assets as discussed below. NEER operates substantially all of the energy projects in NEP's portfolio and its ownership interest in the portfolio's generating



capacity was approximately 2,429 MW at

December 31, 2017

. In addition in 2015, NEP OpCo issued 2 million NEP OpCo Class B Units to NEER in exchange for an approximately 50% ownership interest in three solar projects with a total generating capacity of 277 MW. NEER, as holder of the Class B Units, will retain 100% of the economic interests if, and until, NEER offers to sell the economic interests to NEP and NEP accepts such offer. NEP OpCo has a right of first offer for certain of NEER's assets (ROFO assets) if NEER should seek to sell the assets. The ROFO assets remaining at

December 31, 2017

, include contracted wind and solar projects with a combined generating capacity of approximately 1,076 MW. In addition, NEER and its subsidiaries (other than NEP OpCo and its subsidiaries) have a right of first refusal on any proposed sale of any of the NEP OpCo assets. In 2015, NEP acquired the membership interests in NET Holdings Management, LLC (Texas pipeline business), a developer, owner and operator of a portfolio of seven intrastate long-term contracted natural gas pipeline assets located in Texas (Texas pipelines). See Generation and Other Operations - Generation Assets and Other Operations - Other Operations below.

During 2017, changes were made to NEP's governance structure that, among other things, enhanced NEP unitholder governance rights. As a result of the governance changes, NEP was deconsolidated from NEE in January 2018 and going forward, NEE will reflect its ownership interest in NEP as an equity method investment and future earnings from NEP as equity in earnings of equity method investees in its consolidated financial statements. Additionally, sales of assets to NEP will be accounted for as third-party sales. See Note 1 - NextEra Energy Partners, LP.

GENERATION AND OTHER OPERATIONS

NEER sells products associated with its own generation facilities (energy, capacity, renewable energy credits (RECs) and ancillary services) in competitive markets in regions where those facilities are located. Customer transactions may be supplied from NEER generation facilities or from purchases in the wholesale markets, or from a combination thereof. See Markets and Competition below.

At

December 31, 2017

, NEER managed or participated in the management of essentially all of its generation projects and all of its natural gas pipeline assets in which it has an ownership interest. At

December 31, 2017

, the locations of NEER's generation facilities and natural gas pipeline assets in North America were as follows:



Generation Assets and Other Operations

Generation Assets.

NEER's portfolio of generation assets primarily consist of generation facilities with long-term power sales agreements for substantially all of their capacity and/or energy output. Information related to contracted generation assets at

December 31, 2017

was as follows:

•

represented approximately

17,012

MW of total net generating capacity;

•

weighted-average remaining contract term of the power sales agreements and the remaining life of the PTCs associated with repowered wind facilities of approximately 17 years, based on forecasted contributions to earnings and forecasted amounts of electricity produced by the repowered wind facilities; and

•

contracts for the supply of uranium and the conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel have expiration dates ranging from March 2018 through 2033 (see Note 13 - Contracts).

NEER's merchant generation assets primarily consist of a nuclear generation facility and oil-fired generation facilities that do not have long-term power sales agreements to sell their capacity and/or energy output and therefore require active marketing and hedging. Merchant generation assets at

December 31, 2017

represented approximately

2,047

MW of total net generating capacity, including

1,102

MW from nuclear generation and


MW from oil-fired peak generation facilities, and are primarily located in the Northeast region of the U.S. NEER utilizes swaps, options, futures and forwards to lock in pricing and manage the commodity price risk inherent in power sales and fuel purchases.

Other Operations.

primarily located in Maine.



Nuclear Facilities

At

December 31, 2017

, NEER owned, or had undivided interests in, and operated the four nuclear units discussed below. NEER's nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate planned refueling and maintenance outages, including inspections, repairs and certain other modifications. Scheduled nuclear refueling outages typically require the unit to be removed from service for variable lengths of time.

______________________

(a)

Excludes 147 MW operated by NEER but owned by non-affiliates.

(b)

In 2010, NEER filed an application with the NRC to renew Seabrook's operating license for an additional 20 years, which license renewal is pending.

(c)

Excludes 184 MW operated by NEER but owned by non-affiliates.

(d)

NEER sells all of its share of the output of Duane Arnold under a long-term contract expiring in December 2025. See Note 4 - Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.

(e)

NEER sells all of the output of Point Beach Units Nos. 1 and 2 under long-term contracts through their current operating license expiration dates.

NEER is responsible for all nuclear unit operations and the ultimate decommissioning of the nuclear units, the cost of which is shared on a pro-rata basis by the joint owners for the jointly-owned units. NRC regulations require plant owners to submit a plan for decontamination and decommissioning five years before the projected end of plant operation.

NEER's nuclear facilities use both on-site storage pools and dry storage casks to store spent nuclear fuel generated by these facilities, which are expected to provide sufficient storage of spent nuclear fuel at these facilities through license expiration.

Policy Incentives for Renewable Energy Projects

U.S. federal, state and local governments have established various incentives to support the development of renewable energy projects. These incentives include accelerated tax depreciation, PTCs, ITCs, cash grants, tax abatements and RPS programs. Pursuant to the U.S. federal Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS), wind and solar projects are fully depreciated for tax purposes over a five-year period even though the useful life of such projects is generally much longer than five years.

Owners of utility-scale wind facilities are eligible to claim an income tax credit (the PTC, or an ITC in lieu of the PTC) upon initially achieving commercial operation. The PTC is determined based on the amount of electricity produced by the wind facility during the first ten years of commercial operation. This incentive was created under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and has been extended several times. Alternatively, an ITC equal to 30% of the cost of a wind facility may be claimed in lieu of the PTC. In order to qualify for the PTC (or ITC in lieu of the PTC), construction of a wind facility must begin before a specified date and the taxpayer must maintain a continuous program of construction or continuous efforts to advance the project to completion. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued guidance stating that the safe harbor for continuous efforts and continuous construction requirements will generally be satisfied if the facility is placed in service no more than four years after the year in which construction of the facility began. The IRS also confirmed that retrofitted wind facilities may re-qualify for PTCs or ITCs pursuant to the 5% safe harbor for the begin construction requirement, as long as the cost basis of the new investment is at least 80% of the facility’s total fair value.

Owners of solar projects are eligible to claim a 30% ITC for new solar projects, or could have elected to receive an equivalent cash payment from the U.S. Department of Treasury for the value of the 30% ITC (convertible ITC) for qualifying solar projects where construction began before the end of 2011 and the projects were placed in service before 2017. Tax credits for qualifying wind and solar projects are subject to the following phase-down schedule.

_________________________

(a)

Percentage of the full PTC available for wind projects that begin construction during the applicable year.

(b)

ITC is limited to 10% for projects not placed in service before January 1, 2024.

Other countries, including Canada and Spain, provide for incentives like feed-in-tariffs for renewable energy projects. The feed-in-tariffs promote renewable energy investments by offering long-term contracts to renewable energy producers, typically based on the cost of generation of each technology.



MARKETS AND COMPETITION

Electricity markets in the U.S. and Canada are regional and diverse in character. All are extensively regulated, and competition in these markets is shaped and constrained by regulation. The nature of the products offered varies based on the specifics of regulation in each region. Generally, in addition to the natural constraints on pricing freedom presented by competition, NEER may also face specific constraints in the form of price caps, or maximum allowed prices, for certain products. NEER's ability to sell the output of its generation facilities may also be constrained by available transmission capacity, which can vary from time to time and can have a significant impact on pricing.

The degree and nature of competition that NEER faces is different in wholesale markets and in retail markets. During


, approximately 87% of NEER's revenue was derived from wholesale electricity markets.

Wholesale power generation is a capital-intensive, commodity-driven business with numerous industry participants. NEER primarily competes on the basis of price, but believes the green attributes of NEER's generation assets, its creditworthiness and its ability to offer and manage reliable customized risk solutions to wholesale customers are competitive advantages. Wholesale power generation is a regional business that is highly fragmented relative to many other commodity industries and diverse in terms of industry structure. As such, there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identity of the companies NEER competes with depending on the market. In wholesale markets, customers' needs are met through a variety of means, including long-term bilateral contracts, standardized bilateral products such as full requirements service and customized supply and risk management services.

In general, U.S. electricity markets encompass three classes of services: energy, capacity and ancillary services. Energy services relate to the physical delivery of power; capacity services relate to the availability of MW capacity of a power generation asset; and ancillary services are other services that relate to power generation assets, such as load regulation and spinning and non-spinning reserves. The exact nature of these classes of services is defined in part by regional tariffs. Not all regions have a capacity services class, and the specific definitions of ancillary services vary from region to region.

RTOs and ISOs exist throughout much of North America to coordinate generation and transmission across wide geographic areas and to run markets. NEER operates in all RTO and ISO jurisdictions. At

December 31, 2017

, NEER also had generation facilities with ownership interests in a total net generating capacity of approximately 2,845 MW that fall within reliability regions that are not under the jurisdiction of an established RTO or ISO, including 2,224 MW within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council. Although each RTO and ISO may have differing objectives and structures, some benefits of these entities include regional planning, managing transmission congestion, developing larger wholesale markets for energy and capacity, maintaining reliability and facilitating competition among wholesale electricity providers. NEER has operations that fall within the following RTOs and ISOs:



NEER competes in different regions to different degrees, but in general it seeks to enter into long-term bilateral contracts for the full output of its generation facilities, and, at

December 31, 2017

, approximately

89%

of NEER's net generating capacity was committed under long-term contracts. Where long-term contracts are not in effect, NEER sells the output of its facilities into daily spot markets. In such cases, NEER will frequently enter into shorter term bilateral contracts, typically of less than three years duration, to hedge the price risk associated with selling into a daily spot market. Such bilateral contracts, which may be hedges either for physical delivery or for financial (pricing) offset, serve to protect a portion of the revenue that NEER expects to derive from the associated generation facility. Contracts that serve the economic purpose of hedging some portion of the expected revenue of a generation facility but are not recorded as hedges under GAAP are referred to as “non-qualifying hedges” for adjusted earnings purposes. See Management's Discussion - Overview - Adjusted Earnings.

Certain facilities within the NEER wind and solar generation portfolio produce RECs and other environmental attributes which are typically sold along with the energy from the plants under long-term contracts, or may be sold separately for the wind and solar generation not sold under long-term contracts. The purchasing party is solely entitled to the reporting rights and ownership of the environmental attributes.

While the majority of NEER's revenue is derived from the output of its generation facilities, NEER is also an active competitor in several regions in the wholesale full requirements business and in providing structured and customized power and fuel products and services to a variety of customers. In the full requirements service, typically, the supplier agrees to meet the customer's needs for a full range of products for every hour of the day, at a fixed price, for a predetermined period of time, thereby assuming the risk of fluctuations in the customer's volume requirements.

Expanded competition in a frequently changing regulatory environment presents both opportunities and risks for NEER. Opportunities exist for the selective acquisition of generation assets and for the construction and operation of efficient facilities that can sell power in competitive markets. NEER seeks to reduce its market risk by having a diversified portfolio by fuel type and location, as well as by contracting for the future sale of a significant amount of the electricity output of its facilities.

NEER REGULATION

The energy markets in which NEER operates are subject to domestic and foreign regulation, as the case may be, including local, state and federal regulation, and other specific rules.

At

December 31, 2017

, NEER had ownership interests in operating independent power projects located in the U.S. that have received exempt wholesale generator status as defined under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, which represent approximately 99% of NEER's net generating capacity in the U.S. Exempt wholesale generators own or operate a facility exclusively to sell electricity to wholesale customers. They are barred from selling electricity directly to retail customers. NEER's exempt wholesale generators produce electricity from wind, fossil fuels, solar and nuclear facilities. While projects with exempt wholesale generator status are exempt from various restrictions, each project must still comply with other federal, state and local laws, including, but not limited to, those regarding siting, construction, operation, licensing, pollution abatement and other environmental laws.

Additionally, most of the NEER facilities located in the U.S. are subject to FERC regulations and market rules and the NERC's mandatory reliability standards, all of its facilities are subject to environmental laws and the EPA's environmental regulations, and its nuclear facilities are also subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC. See FPL - FPL Regulation for additional discussion of FERC, NERC, NRC and EPA regulations. With the exception of facilities located in ERCOT, the FERC has jurisdiction over various aspects of NEER's business in the U.S., including the oversight and investigation of competitive wholesale energy markets, regulation of the transmission and sale of natural gas, and oversight of environmental matters related to natural gas projects and major electricity policy initiatives. The Public Utility Commission of Texas has jurisdiction, including the regulation of rates and services, oversight of competitive markets, and enforcement of statutes and rules, over NEER facilities located in ERCOT.

NEER and its affiliates are also subject to federal and provincial or regional regulations in Canada and Spain related to energy operations, energy markets and environmental standards. In Canada, activities related to owning and operating wind and solar projects and participating in wholesale and retail energy markets are regulated at the provincial level. In Ontario, for example, electricity generation facilities must be licensed by the Ontario Energy Board and may also be required to complete registrations and maintain market participant status with the Independent Electricity System Operator, in which case they must agree to be bound by and comply with the provisions of the market rules for the Ontario electricity market as well as the mandatory reliability standards of the NERC.

In addition, NEER is subject to environmental laws and regulations as described in the NEE Environmental Matters section below. In order to better anticipate potential regulatory changes, NEER continues to actively evaluate and participate in regional market redesigns of existing operating rules for the integration of renewable energy resources and for the purchase and sale of energy commodities.



NEER EMPLOYEES

NEER and its subsidiaries had approximately 5,200 employees at

December 31, 2017

. Certain subsidiaries of NEER have collective bargaining agreements with the IBEW, the Utility Workers Union of America, the Security Police and Fire Professionals of America and the International Union of Operating Engineers, which collectively represent approximately 17% of NEER's employees. The collective bargaining agreements have three- to five-year terms and expire between late February 2018 and 2021.

NEE ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

NEE and FPL are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations, for the siting, construction and ongoing operations of their facilities. The U.S. government and certain states and regions, as well as the Government of Canada and its provinces, have taken and continue to take certain actions, such as proposing and finalizing regulation or setting targets or goals, regarding the regulation and reduction of GHG emissions and the increase of renewable energy generation. Numerous environmental regulations also affecting FPL, NEER and certain other subsidiaries relate to threatened and endangered species and their habitats,

as well as other avian and bat species. Complying with these environmental laws and regulations could result in, among other things, changes in the design and operation of existing facilities and changes or delays in the location, design, construction and operation of new facilities. The impact of complying with current environmental laws and regulations has not had, and, along with compliance with proposed regulations as currently written, is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on the financial statements of NEE and FPL. As permitted by the environmental clause, FPL expects to seek recovery for compliance costs associated with any new environmental laws and regulations.

WEBSITE ACCESS TO SEC FILINGS

NEE and FPL make their SEC filings, including the annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, available free of charge on NEE's internet website, www.nexteraenergy.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after those documents are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The information and materials available on NEE's website (or any of its subsidiaries' or affiliates' websites) are not incorporated by reference into this combined Form 10-K. The SEC maintains an internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding registrants that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors

Risks Relating to NEE's and FPL's Business

The business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL are subject to a variety of risks, many of which are beyond the control of NEE and FPL. These risks, as well as additional risks and uncertainties either not presently known or that are currently believed to not be material to the business, may materially adversely affect the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL and may cause actual results of NEE and FPL to differ substantially from those that NEE or FPL currently expects or seeks. In that event, the market price for the securities of NEE or FPL could decline. Accordingly, the risks described below should be carefully considered together with the other information set forth in this report and in future reports that NEE and FPL file with the SEC.

Regulatory, Legislative and Legal Risks

NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely affected by the extensive regulation of their business.

The operations of NEE and FPL are subject to complex and comprehensive federal, state and other regulation. This extensive regulatory framework, portions of which are more specifically identified in the following risk factors, regulates, among other things and to varying degrees, NEE's and FPL's industries, businesses, rates and cost structures, operation and licensing of nuclear power facilities, construction and operation of electricity generation, transmission and distribution facilities and natural gas and oil production, natural gas, oil and other fuel transportation, processing and storage facilities, acquisition, disposal, depreciation and amortization of facilities and other assets, decommissioning costs and funding, service reliability, wholesale and retail competition, and commodities trading and derivatives transactions. In their business planning and in the management of their operations, NEE and FPL must address the effects of regulation on their business and any inability or failure to do so adequately could have a material adverse effect on their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected if they are unable to recover in a timely manner any significant amount of costs, a return on certain assets or a reasonable return on invested capital through base rates, cost recovery clauses, other regulatory mechanisms or otherwise.

FPL is an electric utility subject to the jurisdiction of the FPSC over a wide range of business activities, including, among other items, the retail rates charged to its customers through base rates and cost recovery clauses, the terms and conditions of its services, procurement of electricity for its customers and fuel for its plant operations, issuances of securities, and aspects of the siting, construction and operation of its generation plants and transmission and distribution systems for the sale of electric energy. The FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery by FPL of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred and to determine the level of return that FPL is permitted to earn on invested capital. The regulatory process, which may be adversely affected by the political, regulatory and economic environment in Florida and elsewhere, limits or could otherwise adversely impact FPL's earnings. The regulatory process also does not provide any assurance as to achievement of authorized or other earnings levels, or that FPL will be permitted to earn an acceptable return on capital investments it wishes to make. NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected if any material amount of costs, a return on certain assets or a reasonable return on invested capital cannot be recovered through base rates, cost recovery clauses, other regulatory mechanisms or otherwise. Certain other subsidiaries of NEE are transmission utilities subject to the jurisdiction of their regulators and are subject to similar risks.

Regulatory decisions that are important to NEE and FPL may be materially adversely affected by political, regulatory and economic factors.

The local and national political, regulatory and economic environment has had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on FPSC decisions with negative consequences for FPL. These decisions may require, for example, FPL to cancel or delay planned development activities, to reduce or delay other planned capital expenditures or to pay for investments or otherwise incur costs that it may not be able to recover through rates, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL. Certain other subsidiaries of NEE are subject to similar risks.

FPL's use of derivative instruments could be subject to prudence challenges and, if found imprudent, could result in disallowances of cost recovery for such use by the FPSC.

The FPSC engages in an annual prudence review of FPL's use of derivative instruments in its risk management fuel procurement program and should it find any such use to be imprudent, the FPSC could deny cost recovery for such use by FPL. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Any reductions or modifications to, or the elimination of, governmental incentives or policies that support utility scale renewable energy, including, but not limited to, tax laws, policies and incentives, RPS or feed-in tariffs, or the imposition of additional taxes or other assessments on renewable energy, could result in, among other items, the lack of a satisfactory market for the development and/or financing of new renewable energy projects, NEER abandoning the development of



renewable energy projects, a loss of NEER's investments in renewable energy projects and reduced project returns, any of which could have a material adverse effect on NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

NEER depends heavily on government policies that support utility scale renewable energy and enhance the economic feasibility of developing and operating wind and solar energy projects in regions in which NEER operates or plans to develop and operate renewable energy facilities. The federal government, a majority of the 50 U.S. states and portions of Canada and Spain provide incentives, such as tax incentives, RPS or feed-in tariffs, that support or are designed to support the sale of energy from utility scale renewable energy facilities, such as wind and solar energy facilities. As a result of budgetary constraints, political factors or otherwise, governments from time to time may review their laws and policies that support renewable energy and consider actions that would make the laws and policies less conducive to the development and operation of renewable energy facilities. Any reductions or modifications to, or the elimination of, governmental incentives or policies that support renewable energy or the imposition of additional taxes or other assessments on renewable energy, could result in, among other items, the lack of a satisfactory market for the development and/or financing of new renewable energy projects, NEER abandoning the development of renewable energy projects, a loss of NEER's investments in the projects and reduced project returns, any of which could have a material adverse effect on NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected as a result of new or revised laws, regulations, interpretations or other regulatory initiatives.

NEE's and FPL's business is influenced by various legislative and regulatory initiatives, including, but not limited to, new or revised laws, including international trade laws, regulations, interpretations and other regulatory initiatives regarding deregulation or restructuring of the energy industry, regulation of the commodities trading and derivatives markets, and regulation of environmental matters, such as regulation of air emissions, regulation of water consumption and water discharges, and regulation of gas and oil infrastructure operations, as well as associated environmental permitting. Changes in the nature of the regulation of NEE's and FPL's business could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. NEE and FPL are unable to predict future legislative or regulatory changes, initiatives or interpretations, although any such changes, initiatives or interpretations may increase costs and competitive pressures on NEE and FPL, which could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

FPL has limited competition in the Florida market for retail electricity customers. Any changes in Florida law or regulation which introduce competition in the Florida retail electricity market, such as government incentives that facilitate the installation of solar generation facilities on residential or other rooftops at below cost or that are otherwise subsidized by non-participants, or would permit third-party sales of electricity, could have a material adverse effect on FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. There can be no assurance that FPL will be able to respond adequately to such regulatory changes, which could have a material adverse effect on FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

NEER is subject to FERC rules related to transmission that are designed to facilitate competition in the wholesale market on practically a nationwide basis by providing greater certainty, flexibility and more choices to wholesale power customers. NEE cannot predict the impact of changing FERC rules or the effect of changes in levels of wholesale supply and demand, which are typically driven by factors beyond NEE's control. There can be no assurance that NEER will be able to respond adequately or sufficiently quickly to such rules and developments, or to any other changes that reverse or restrict the competitive restructuring of the energy industry in those jurisdictions in which such restructuring has occurred. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

NEE’s and FPL’s OTC financial derivatives are subject to rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and similar international regulations that are designed to promote transparency, mitigate systemic risk and protect against market abuse. NEE and FPL cannot predict the impact any proposed or not fully implemented final rules will have on their ability to hedge their commodity and interest rate risks or on OTC derivatives markets as a whole, but such rules and regulations could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's risk exposure, as well as reduce market liquidity and further increase the cost of hedging activities.

NEE and FPL are subject to numerous environmental laws, regulations and other standards that may result in capital expenditures, increased operating costs and various liabilities, and may require NEE and FPL to limit or eliminate certain operations.

NEE and FPL are subject to domestic and foreign environmental laws, regulations and other standards, including, but not limited to, extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality and usage, soil quality, climate change, emissions of greenhouse gases, including, but not limited to, CO


, waste management, hazardous wastes, marine, avian and other wildlife mortality and habitat protection, historical artifact preservation, natural resources, health (including, but not limited to, electric and magnetic fields from power lines and substations), safety and RPS, that could, among other things, prevent or delay the development of power generation, power or natural gas transmission, or other infrastructure projects, restrict the output of some existing facilities, limit the availability and use of some fuels required for the production of electricity, require additional pollution control equipment, and otherwise increase costs, increase capital expenditures and limit or eliminate certain operations.



There are significant capital, operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules and regulations, and those costs could be even more significant in the future as a result of new requirements and stricter or more expansive application of existing environmental regulations. For example, among other new, potential or pending changes are state and federal regulation of the use of hydraulic fracturing or similar technologies to drill for natural gas and related compounds used by NEE's gas infrastructure business.

Violations of current or future laws, rules, regulations or other standards could expose NEE and FPL to regulatory and legal proceedings, disputes with, and legal challenges by, third parties, and potentially significant civil fines, criminal penalties and other sanctions. Proceedings could include, for example, litigation regarding property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance and enforcement by citizens or governmental authorities of environmental requirements.

NEE's and FPL's business could be negatively affected by federal or state laws or regulations mandating new or additional limits on the production of greenhouse gas emissions.

Federal or state laws or regulations may be adopted that would impose new or additional limits on the emissions of greenhouse gases, including, but not limited to, CO


and methane, from electric generation units using fossil fuels like coal and natural gas. The potential effects of greenhouse gas emission limits on NEE's and FPL's electric generation units are subject to significant uncertainties based on, among other things, the timing of the implementation of any new requirements, the required levels of emission reductions, the nature of any market-based or tax-based mechanisms adopted to facilitate reductions, the relative availability of greenhouse gas emission reduction offsets, the development of cost-effective, commercial-scale carbon capture and storage technology and supporting regulations and liability mitigation measures, and the range of available compliance alternatives.

While NEE's and FPL's electric generation units emit greenhouse gases at a lower rate of emissions than most of the U.S. electric generation sector, the results of operations of NEE and FPL could be materially adversely affected to the extent that new federal or state laws or regulations impose any new greenhouse gas emission limits. Any future limits on greenhouse gas emissions could:

•

create substantial additional costs in the form of taxes or emission allowances;

•

make some of NEE's and FPL's electric generation units uneconomical to operate in the long term;

•

require significant capital investment in carbon capture and storage technology, fuel switching, or the replacement of high-emitting generation facilities with lower-emitting generation facilities; or

•

affect the availability or cost of fossil fuels.

There can be no assurance that NEE or FPL would be able to completely recover any such costs or investments, which could have a material adverse effect on their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Extensive federal regulation of the operations and businesses of NEE and FPL exposes NEE and FPL to significant and increasing compliance costs and may also expose them to substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions for compliance failures.

NEE's and FPL's operations and businesses are subject to extensive federal regulation, which generally imposes significant and increasing compliance costs on their operations and businesses. Additionally, any actual or alleged compliance failures could result in significant costs and other potentially adverse effects of regulatory investigations, proceedings, settlements, decisions and claims, including, among other items, potentially significant monetary penalties. As an example, under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, NEE and FPL, as owners and operators of bulk-power transmission systems and/or electric generation facilities, are subject to mandatory reliability standards. Compliance with these mandatory reliability standards may subject NEE and FPL to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures. If FPL or NEE is found not to be in compliance with these standards, it may incur substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions. Both the costs of regulatory compliance and the costs that may be imposed as a result of any actual or alleged compliance failures could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Changes in tax laws, guidance or policies, including but not limited to changes in corporate income tax rates, as well as judgments and estimates used in the determination of tax-related asset and liability amounts, could materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

NEE's and FPL's provision for income taxes and reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities require significant judgments and the use of estimates. Amounts of tax-related assets and liabilities involve judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income, deductions and tax credits, including, but not limited to, estimates for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken and the ability to utilize tax benefit carryforwards, such as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Actual income taxes could vary significantly from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of, among other things, changes in tax laws, guidance or policies, including changes in corporate income tax rates, the financial condition and results of operations of NEE and FPL, and the resolution of audit issues raised by taxing authorities. These factors, including the ultimate resolution of income tax matters, may result in material adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities, which could materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.



NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely affected due to adverse results of litigation.

NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially affected by adverse results of litigation. Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings in which NEE is involved or other future legal proceedings, including, but not limited to, class action lawsuits, may have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL.

Operational Risks

NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could suffer if NEE and FPL do not proceed with projects under development or are unable to complete the construction of, or capital improvements to, electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, gas infrastructure facilities or other facilities on schedule or within budget.

NEE's and FPL's ability to proceed with projects under development and to complete construction of, and capital improvement projects for, their electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, gas infrastructure facilities and other facilities on schedule and within budget may be adversely affected by escalating costs for materials and labor and regulatory compliance, inability to obtain or renew necessary licenses, rights-of-way, permits or other approvals on acceptable terms or on schedule, disputes involving contractors, labor organizations, land owners, governmental entities, environmental groups, Native American and aboriginal groups, lessors, joint venture partners and other third parties, negative publicity, transmission interconnection issues and other factors. If any development project or construction or capital improvement project is not completed, is delayed or is subject to cost overruns, certain associated costs may not be approved for recovery or otherwise be recoverable through regulatory mechanisms that may be available, and NEE and FPL could become obligated to make delay or termination payments or become obligated for other damages under contracts, could experience the loss of tax credits or tax incentives, or delayed or diminished returns, and could be required to write off all or a portion of their investment in the project. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

NEE and FPL may face risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, governmental approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements that may impede their development and operating activities.

NEE and FPL own, develop, construct, manage and operate electric-generation and transmission facilities and natural gas transmission facilities. A key component of NEE's and FPL's growth is their ability to construct and operate generation and transmission facilities to meet customer needs. As part of these operations, NEE and FPL must periodically apply for licenses and permits from various local, state, federal and other regulatory authorities and abide by their respective conditions. Should NEE or FPL be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits on acceptable terms, should there be a delay in obtaining or renewing necessary licenses or permits or should regulatory authorities initiate any associated investigations or enforcement actions or impose related penalties or disallowances on NEE or FPL, NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected. Any failure to negotiate successful project development agreements for new facilities with third parties could have similar results.

The operation and maintenance of NEE's and FPL's electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, gas infrastructure facilities and other facilities are subject to many operational risks, the consequences of which could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

NEE's and FPL's electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, gas infrastructure facilities and other facilities are subject to many operational risks. Operational risks could result in, among other things, lost revenues due to prolonged outages, increased expenses due to monetary penalties or fines for compliance failures, liability to third parties for property and personal injury damage, a failure to perform under applicable power sales agreements or other agreements and associated loss of revenues from terminated agreements or liability for liquidated damages under continuing agreements, and replacement equipment costs or an obligation to purchase or generate replacement power at higher prices.

Uncertainties and risks inherent in operating and maintaining NEE's and FPL's facilities include, but are not limited to:

•

risks associated with facility start-up operations, such as whether the facility will achieve projected operating performance on schedule and otherwise as planned;

•

failures in the availability, acquisition or transportation of fuel or other necessary supplies;

•

the impact of unusual or adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, icing events, floods, earthquakes and droughts;

•

performance below expected or contracted levels of output or efficiency;

•

breakdown or failure, including, but not limited to, explosions, fires, leaks or other major events, of equipment, transmission and distribution lines or pipelines;

•

availability of replacement equipment;

•

risks of property damage or human injury from energized equipment, hazardous substances or explosions, fires, leaks or other events;



•

availability of adequate water resources and ability to satisfy water intake and discharge requirements;

•

inability to identify, manage properly or mitigate equipment defects in NEE's and FPL's facilities;

•

use of new or unproven technology;

•

risks associated with dependence on a specific type of fuel or fuel source, such as commodity price risk, availability of adequate fuel supply and transportation, and lack of available alternative fuel sources;

•

increased competition due to, among other factors, new facilities, excess supply, shifting demand and regulatory changes; and

•

insufficient insurance, warranties or performance guarantees to cover any or all lost revenues or increased expenses from the foregoing.

NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers or in customer usage.

Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence the demand for electricity and the need for additional power generation and power delivery facilities, as well as the need for energy-related commodities such as natural gas. Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of NEE and FPL, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand side management requirements, and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity. A lack of growth, or a decline, in the number of customers or in customer demand for electricity or natural gas and other fuels may cause NEE and FPL to fail to fully realize the anticipated benefits from significant investments and expenditures and could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's growth, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects can be materially adversely affected by weather conditions, including, but not limited to, the impact of severe weather.

Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and other fuels and affect the price of energy and energy-related commodities. In addition, severe weather and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, icing events and earthquakes, can be destructive and cause power outages and property damage, reduce revenue, affect the availability of fuel and water, and require NEE and FPL to incur additional costs, for example, to restore service and repair damaged facilities, to obtain replacement power and to access available financing sources. Furthermore, NEE's and FPL's physical plants could be placed at greater risk of damage should changes in the global climate produce unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, abnormal levels of precipitation and, particularly relevant to FPL, a change in sea level. FPL operates in the east and lower west coasts of Florida, an area that historically has been prone to severe weather events, such as hurricanes. A disruption or failure of electric generation, transmission or distribution systems or natural gas production, transmission, storage or distribution systems in the event of a hurricane, tornado or other severe weather event, or otherwise, could prevent NEE and FPL from operating their business in the normal course and could result in any of the adverse consequences described above. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

At FPL and other businesses of NEE where cost recovery is available, recovery of costs to restore service and repair damaged facilities is or may be subject to regulatory approval, and any determination by the regulator not to permit timely and full recovery of the costs incurred could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Changes in weather can also affect the production of electricity at power generation facilities, including, but not limited to, NEER's wind and solar facilities. For example, the level of wind resource affects the revenue produced by wind generation facilities. Because the levels of wind and solar resources are variable and difficult to predict, NEER's results of operations for individual wind and solar facilities specifically, and NEE's results of operations generally, may vary significantly from period to period, depending on the level of available resources. To the extent that resources are not available at planned levels, the financial results from these facilities may be less than expected.

Threats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism, cyber attacks, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt NEE's and FPL's business, or the businesses of third parties, may materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

NEE and FPL are subject to the potentially adverse operating and financial effects of terrorist acts and threats, as well as cyber attacks and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups. There have been cyber attacks on energy infrastructure such as substations, gas pipelines and related assets in the past and there may be such attacks in the future. NEE's and FPL's generation, transmission and distribution facilities, fuel storage facilities, information technology systems and other infrastructure facilities and systems could be direct targets of, or otherwise be materially adversely affected by, such activities.

Terrorist acts, cyber attacks or other similar events affecting NEE's and FPL's systems and facilities, or those of third parties on which NEE and FPL rely, could harm NEE's and FPL's business, for example, by limiting their ability to generate, purchase or transmit power, natural gas or other energy-related commodities by limiting their ability to bill customers and collect and process payments, and by delaying their development and construction of new generation, distribution or transmission facilities or capital improvements to existing facilities. These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in



revenues, significant additional costs (for example, to repair assets, implement additional security requirements or maintain or acquire insurance), significant fines and penalties, and reputational damage, could materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's operations (for example, by contributing to disruption of supplies and markets for natural gas, oil and other fuels), and could impair NEE's and FPL's ability to raise capital (for example, by contributing to financial instability and lower economic activity). In addition, the implementation of security guidelines and measures has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased costs. Such events or actions may materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

The ability of NEE and FPL to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be materially adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. NEE's and FPL's insurance coverage does not provide protection against all significant losses.

Insurance coverage may not continue to be available or may not be available at rates or on terms similar to those presently available to NEE and FPL. The ability of NEE and FPL to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be materially adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. If insurance coverage is not available or obtainable on acceptable terms, NEE or FPL may be required to pay costs associated with adverse future events. NEE and FPL generally are not fully insured against all significant losses. For example, FPL is not fully insured against hurricane-related losses, but would instead seek recovery of such uninsured losses from customers subject to approval by the FPSC, to the extent losses exceed restricted funds set aside to cover the cost of storm damage. A loss for which NEE or FPL is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

NEE invests in gas and oil producing and transmission assets through NEER’s gas infrastructure business. The gas infrastructure business is exposed to fluctuating market prices of natural gas, natural gas liquids, oil and other energy commodities. A prolonged period of low gas and oil prices could impact NEER’s gas infrastructure business and cause NEER to delay or cancel certain gas infrastructure projects and for certain existing projects to be impaired, which could materially adversely affect NEE's results of operations.

Natural gas and oil prices are affected by supply and demand, both globally and regionally. Factors that influence supply and demand include operational issues, natural disasters, weather, political instability, conflicts, new discoveries, technological advances, economic conditions and actions by major oil-producing countries. There can be significant volatility in market prices for gas and oil, and price fluctuations could have a material effect on the financial performance of gas and oil producing and transmission assets. For example, in a low gas and oil price environment, NEER would generate less revenue from its gas infrastructure investments in gas and oil producing properties, and as a result certain investments might become less profitable or incur losses. Prolonged periods of low oil and gas prices could also result in oil and gas production and transmission projects to be delayed or cancelled or to experience lower returns, and for certain projects to become impaired, which could materially adversely affect NEE's results of operations.

If supply costs necessary to provide NEER's full energy and capacity requirement services are not favorable, operating costs could increase and materially adversely affect NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

NEER provides full energy and capacity requirements

services primarily to distribution utilities, which include load-following services and various ancillary services, to satisfy all or a portion of such utilities' power supply obligations to their customers. The supply costs for these transactions may be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, events that may occur after such utilities have committed to supply power, such as weather conditions, fluctuating prices for energy and ancillary services, and the ability of the distribution utilities' customers to elect to receive service from competing suppliers. NEER may not be able to recover all of its increased supply costs, which could have a material adverse effect on NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Due to the potential for significant volatility in market prices for fuel, electricity and renewable and other energy commodities, NEER's inability or failure to manage properly or hedge effectively the commodity risks within its portfolios could materially adversely affect NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

There can be significant volatility in market prices for fuel, electricity and renewable and other energy commodities. NEE's inability or failure to manage properly or hedge effectively its assets or positions against changes in commodity prices, volumes, interest rates, counterparty credit risk or other risk measures, based on factors that are either within, or wholly or partially outside of, NEE's control, may materially adversely affect NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.



Reductions in the liquidity of energy markets may restrict the ability of NEE to manage its operational risks, which, in turn, could negatively affect NEE's results of operations.

NEE is an active participant in energy markets. The liquidity of regional energy markets is an important factor in NEE's ability to manage risks in these operations. Market liquidity is driven in part by the number of active market participants, which has declined in recent years as some banks and other financial institutions have withdrawn from power marketing. Liquidity in the energy markets can be adversely affected by price volatility, restrictions on the availability of credit and other factors, and any reduction in the liquidity of energy markets could have a material adverse effect on NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

NEE's and FPL's hedging and trading procedures and associated risk management tools may not protect against significant losses.

NEE and FPL have hedging and trading procedures and associated risk management tools, such as separate but complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance and legal reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms. NEE and FPL are unable to assure that such procedures and tools will be effective against all potential risks, including, without limitation, employee misconduct. If such procedures and tools are not effective, this could have a material adverse effect on NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

If price movements significantly or persistently deviate from historical behavior, NEE's and FPL's risk management tools associated with their hedging and trading procedures may not protect against significant losses.

NEE's and FPL's risk management tools and metrics associated with their hedging and trading procedures, such as daily value at risk, earnings at risk, stop loss limits and liquidity guidelines, are based on historical price movements. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in price movements and potential deviation from historical pricing behavior, NEE and FPL are unable to assure that their risk management tools and metrics will be effective to protect against material adverse effects on their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

If power transmission or natural gas, nuclear fuel or other commodity transportation facilities are unavailable or disrupted, FPL's and NEER's ability to sell and deliver power or natural gas may be limited.

FPL and NEER depend upon power transmission and natural gas, nuclear fuel and other commodity transportation facilities, many of which they do not own. Occurrences affecting the operation of these facilities that may or may not be beyond FPL's and NEER's control (such as severe weather or a generation or transmission facility outage, pipeline rupture, or sudden and significant increase or decrease in wind generation) may limit or halt the ability of FPL and NEER to sell and deliver power and natural gas, or to purchase necessary fuels and other commodities, which could materially adversely impact NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

NEE and FPL are subject to credit and performance risk from customers, hedging counterparties and vendors.

NEE and FPL are exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness and performance of their customers, hedging counterparties and vendors under contracts for the supply of equipment, materials, fuel and other goods and services required for their business operations and for the construction and operation of, and for capital improvements to, their facilities. Adverse conditions in the energy industry or the general economy, as well as circumstances of individual customers, hedging counterparties and vendors, may adversely affect the ability of some customers, hedging counterparties and vendors to perform as required under their contracts with NEE and FPL. For example, the prolonged downturn in oil and natural gas prices has adversely affected the financial stability of a number of enterprises in the energy industry, including some with which NEE does business.

If any hedging, vending or other counterparty fails to fulfill its contractual obligations, NEE and FPL may need to make arrangements with other counterparties or vendors, which could result in material financial losses, higher costs, untimely completion of power generation facilities and other projects, and/or a disruption of their operations. If a defaulting counterparty is in poor financial condition, NEE and FPL may not be able to recover damages for any contract breach.

NEE and FPL could recognize financial losses or a reduction in operating cash flows if a counterparty fails to perform or make payments in accordance with the terms of derivative contracts or if NEE or FPL is required to post margin cash collateral under derivative contracts.

NEE and FPL use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, some of which are traded in the OTC markets or on exchanges, to manage their commodity and financial market risks, and for NEE to engage in trading and marketing activities. Any failures by their counterparties to perform or make payments in accordance with the terms of those transactions could have a material adverse effect on NEE's or FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Similarly, any requirement for FPL or NEE to post margin cash collateral under its derivative contracts could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. These risks may be increased during periods of adverse market or economic conditions affecting the industries in which NEE participates.



NEE and FPL are highly dependent on sensitive and complex information technology systems, and any failure or breach of those systems could have a material adverse effect on their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

NEE and FPL operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continuous functioning of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite NEE's and FPL's implementation of security measures, all of their technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access due to such activities. If NEE's or FPL's information technology systems were to fail or be breached, sensitive confidential and other data could be compromised and NEE and FPL could be unable to fulfill critical business functions.

NEE's and FPL's business is highly dependent on their ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex and cross numerous and diverse markets. Due to the size, scope, complexity and geographical reach of NEE's and FPL's business, the development and maintenance of information technology systems to keep track of and process information is critical and challenging. NEE's and FPL's operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are either within, or wholly or partially outside of, their control, such as operator error, severe weather, terrorist activities or cyber incidents. Any such failure or disabling event could materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's ability to process transactions and provide services, and their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

NEE and FPL add, modify and replace information systems on a regular basis. Modifying existing information systems or implementing new or replacement information systems is costly and involves risks, including, but not limited to, integrating the modified, new or replacement system with existing systems and processes, implementing associated changes in accounting procedures and controls, and ensuring that data conversion is accurate and consistent. Any disruptions or deficiencies in existing information systems, or disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the modification or implementation of new information systems, could result in increased costs, the inability to track or collect revenues and the diversion of management's and employees' attention and resources, and could negatively impact the effectiveness of the companies' control environment, and/or the companies' ability to timely file required regulatory reports.

NEE and FPL also face the risks of operational failure or capacity constraints of third parties, including, but not limited to, those who provide power transmission and natural gas transportation services.

NEE's and FPL's retail businesses are subject to the risk that sensitive customer data may be compromised, which could result in a material adverse impact to their reputation and/or have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL.

NEE's and FPL's retail businesses require access to sensitive customer data in the ordinary course of business. NEE's and FPL's retail businesses may also need to provide sensitive customer data to vendors and service providers who require access to this information in order to provide services, such as call center services, to the retail businesses. If a significant breach occurred, the reputation of NEE and FPL could be materially adversely affected, customer confidence could be diminished, or customer information could be subject to identity theft. NEE and FPL would be subject to costs associated with the breach and/or NEE and FPL could be subject to fines and legal claims, any of which may have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of NEE and FPL.

NEE and FPL could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of derivative instruments and limited liquidity in OTC markets.

NEE and FPL execute transactions in derivative instruments on either recognized exchanges or via the OTC markets, depending on management's assessment of the most favorable credit and market execution factors. Transactions executed in OTC markets have the potential for greater volatility and less liquidity than transactions on recognized exchanges. As a result, NEE and FPL may not be able to execute desired OTC transactions due to such heightened volatility and limited liquidity.

In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of derivative instruments involves management's judgment and use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these derivative instruments and have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

NEE and FPL may be materially adversely affected by negative publicity.

From time to time, political and public sentiment may result in a significant amount of adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting NEE and FPL. Adverse press coverage and other adverse statements, whether or not driven by political or public sentiment, may also result in investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in legal claims. Responding to these investigations and lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding, can divert the time and effort of senior management from NEE's and FPL's business.



Addressing any adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny or enforcement or other legal proceedings is time consuming and expensive and, regardless of the factual basis for the assertions being made, can have a negative impact on the reputation of NEE and FPL, on the morale and performance of their employees and on their relationships with their respective regulators. It may also have a negative impact on their ability to take timely advantage of various business and market opportunities. The direct and indirect effects of negative publicity, and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely affected if FPL is unable to maintain, negotiate or renegotiate franchise agreements on acceptable terms with municipalities and counties in Florida.

FPL must negotiate franchise agreements with municipalities and counties in Florida to provide electric services within such municipalities and counties, and electricity sales generated pursuant to these agreements represent a very substantial portion of FPL's revenues. If FPL is unable to maintain, negotiate or renegotiate such franchise agreements on acceptable terms, it could contribute to lower earnings and FPL may not fully realize the anticipated benefits from significant investments and expenditures, which could materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected by work strikes or stoppages and increasing personnel costs.

Employee strikes or work stoppages could disrupt operations and lead to a loss of revenue and customers. Personnel costs may also increase due to inflationary or competitive pressures on payroll and benefits costs and revised terms of collective bargaining agreements with union employees. These consequences could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

NEE's ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including, but not limited to, the effect of increased competition for acquisitions resulting from the consolidation of the power industry.

NEE is likely to encounter significant competition for acquisition opportunities that may become available as a result of the consolidation of the power industry in general. In addition, NEE may be unable to identify attractive acquisition opportunities at favorable prices and to complete and integrate them successfully and in a timely manner.

Nuclear Generation Risks

The operation and maintenance of NEE's and FPL's nuclear generation facilities involve environmental, health and financial risks that could result in fines or the closure of the facilities and in increased costs and capital expenditures.

NEE's and FPL's nuclear generation facilities are subject to environmental, health and financial risks, including, but not limited to, those relating to site storage of spent nuclear fuel, the disposition of spent nuclear fuel, leakage and emissions of tritium and other radioactive elements in the event of a nuclear accident or otherwise, the threat of a terrorist attack or cyber incident and other potential liabilities arising out of the ownership or operation of the facilities. NEE and FPL maintain decommissioning funds and external insurance coverage which are intended to reduce the financial exposure to some of these risks; however, the cost of decommissioning nuclear generation facilities could exceed the amount available in NEE's and FPL's decommissioning funds, and the exposure to liability and property damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. If NEE or FPL is unable to recover the additional costs incurred through insurance or, in the case of FPL, through regulatory mechanisms, their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.

In the event of an incident at any nuclear generation facility in the U.S. or at certain nuclear generation facilities in Europe, NEE and FPL could be assessed significant retrospective assessments and/or retrospective insurance premiums as a result of their participation in a secondary financial protection system and nuclear insurance mutual companies.

Liability for accidents at nuclear power plants is governed by the Price-Anderson Act, which limits the liability of nuclear reactor owners to the amount of insurance available from both private sources and an industry retrospective payment plan. In accordance with this Act, NEE maintains the maximum amount of private liability insurance obtainable, and participates in a secondary financial protection system, which provides liability insurance coverage for an incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S. Under the secondary financial protection system, NEE is subject to retrospective assessments and/or retrospective insurance premiums, plus any applicable taxes, for an incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S. or at certain nuclear generation facilities in Europe, regardless of fault or proximity to the incident. Such assessments, if levied, could materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

NRC orders or new regulations related to increased security measures and any future safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require NEE and FPL to incur substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear generation facilities and/or result in reduced revenues.



The NRC has broad authority to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation and maintenance of nuclear generation facilities, the addition of capacity at existing nuclear generation facilities and the construction of new nuclear generation facilities, and these requirements are subject to change. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down a nuclear generation facility, depending upon the NRC's assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Any of the foregoing events could require NEE and FPL to incur increased costs and capital expenditures, and could reduce revenues.

Any serious nuclear incident occurring at a NEE or FPL plant could result in substantial remediation costs and other expenses. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear generation facility. An incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world also could cause the NRC to impose additional conditions or other requirements on the industry, or on certain types of nuclear generation units, which could increase costs, reduce revenues and result in additional capital expenditures.

The inability to operate any of NEE's or FPL's nuclear generation units through the end of their respective operating licenses could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

If any of NEE's or FPL's nuclear generation facilities are not operated for any reason through the life of their respective operating licenses, NEE or FPL may be required to increase depreciation rates, incur impairment charges and accelerate future decommissioning expenditures, any of which could materially adversely affect their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

NEE's and FPL's nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate planned refueling and maintenance outages, and for other purposes. If planned outages last longer than anticipated or if there are unplanned outages, NEE's and FPL's results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

NEE's and FPL's nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate planned refueling and maintenance outages, including, but not limited to, inspections, repairs and certain other modifications as well as to replace equipment. In the event that a scheduled outage lasts longer than anticipated or in the event of an unplanned outage due to, for example, equipment failure, such outages could materially adversely affect NEE's or FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Liquidity, Capital Requirements and Common Stock Risks

Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets may negatively affect NEE's and FPL's ability to fund their liquidity and capital needs and to meet their growth objectives, and can also materially adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition of NEE and FPL.

NEE and FPL rely on access to capital and credit markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements and other operations requirements that are not satisfied by operating cash flows. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in those capital and credit markets could increase NEE's and FPL's cost of capital and affect their ability to fund their liquidity and capital needs and to meet their growth objectives. If NEE or FPL is unable to access regularly the capital and credit markets on terms that are reasonable, it may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities and incur an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could adversely affect its ability to grow its business, could contribute to lower earnings and reduced financial flexibility, and could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Although NEE's competitive energy and certain other subsidiaries have used non-recourse or limited-recourse, project-specific or other financing in the past, market conditions and other factors could adversely affect

the future availability of such financing. The inability of NEE's subsidiaries, including, without limitation, NEECH and NEP and their respective subsidiaries, to access the capital and credit markets to provide project-specific or other financing for electric generation or other facilities or acquisitions on favorable terms, whether because of disruptions or volatility in those markets or otherwise, could necessitate additional capital raising or borrowings by NEE and/or NEECH in the future.

The inability of subsidiaries that have existing project-specific or other financing arrangements to meet the requirements of various agreements relating to those financings could give rise to a project-specific financing default which, if not cured or waived, might result in the specific project, and potentially in some limited instances its parent companies, being required to repay the associated debt or other borrowings earlier than otherwise anticipated, and if such repayment were not made, the lenders or security holders would generally have rights to foreclose against the project assets and related collateral. Such an occurrence also could result in NEE expending additional funds or incurring additional obligations over the shorter term to ensure continuing compliance with project-specific financing arrangements based upon the expectation of improvement in the project's performance or financial returns over the longer term. Any of these actions could materially adversely affect NEE's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as the availability or terms of future financings for NEE or its subsidiaries.



NEE's, NEECH's and FPL's inability to maintain their current credit ratings may materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's liquidity and results of operations, limit the ability of NEE and FPL to grow their business, and increase interest costs.

The inability of NEE, NEECH and FPL to maintain their current credit ratings could materially adversely affect their ability to raise capital or obtain credit on favorable terms, which, in turn, could impact NEE's and FPL's ability to grow their business and service indebtedness and repay borrowings, and would likely increase their interest costs. In addition, certain agreements and guarantee arrangements would require posting of additional collateral in the event of a ratings downgrade. Some of the factors that can affect credit ratings are cash flows, liquidity, the amount of debt as a component of total capitalization, NEE's overall business mix and political, legislative and regulatory actions. There can be no assurance that one or more of the ratings of NEE, NEECH and FPL will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency.

NEE's and FPL's liquidity may be impaired if their credit providers are unable to fund their credit commitments to the companies or to maintain their current credit ratings.

The inability of NEE's, NEECH's and FPL's credit providers to fund their credit commitments or to maintain their current credit ratings could require NEE, NEECH or FPL, among other things, to renegotiate requirements in agreements, find an alternative credit provider with acceptable credit ratings to meet funding requirements, or post cash collateral and could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's liquidity.

Poor market performance and other economic factors could affect NEE's defined benefit pension plan's funded status, which may materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and prospects.

NEE sponsors a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of NEE and its subsidiaries. A decline in the market value of the assets held in the defined benefit pension plan due to poor investment performance or other factors may increase the funding requirements for this obligation.

NEE's defined benefit pension plan is sensitive to changes in interest rates, since, as interest rates decrease the funding liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefits costs and funding requirements. Any increase in benefits costs or funding requirements may have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.

Poor market performance and other economic factors could adversely affect the asset values of NEE's and FPL's nuclear decommissioning funds, which may materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.

NEE and FPL are required to maintain decommissioning funds to satisfy their future obligations to decommission their nuclear power plants. A decline in the market value of the assets held in the decommissioning funds due to poor investment performance or other factors may increase the funding requirements for these obligations. Any increase in funding requirements may have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.

Certain of NEE's investments are subject to changes in market value and other risks, which may materially adversely affect NEE's liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.

NEE holds certain investments where changes in the fair value affect NEE's financial results. In some cases there may be no observable market values for these investments, requiring fair value estimates to be based on other valuation techniques. This type of analysis requires significant judgment and the actual values realized in a sale of these investments could differ materially from those estimated. A sale of an investment below previously estimated value, or other decline in the fair value of an investment, could result in losses or the write-off of such investment, and may have a material adverse effect on NEE's liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.

NEE may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay funds to NEE.

NEE is a holding company and, as such, has no material operations of its own. Substantially all of NEE's consolidated assets are held by its subsidiaries. NEE's ability to meet its financial obligations, including, but not limited to, its guarantees, and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on its subsidiaries' net income and cash flows, which are subject to the risks of their respective businesses, and their ability to pay upstream dividends or to repay funds to NEE.

NEE's subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no independent obligation to provide NEE with funds for its payment obligations. The subsidiaries have financial obligations, including, but not limited to, payment of debt service, which they must satisfy before they can provide NEE with funds. In addition, in the event of a subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization, NEE's right to participate in a distribution of assets is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors.

The dividend-paying ability of some of the subsidiaries is limited by contractual restrictions which are contained in outstanding financing agreements and which may be included in future financing agreements. The future enactment of laws or regulations also may prohibit or restrict the ability of NEE's subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends or to repay funds.



NEE may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if NEE is required to perform under guarantees of obligations of its subsidiaries.

NEE guarantees many of the obligations of its consolidated subsidiaries, other than FPL, through guarantee agreements with NEECH. These guarantees may require NEE to provide substantial funds to its subsidiaries or their creditors or counterparties at a time when NEE is in need of liquidity to meet its own financial obligations. Funding such guarantees may materially adversely affect NEE's ability to meet its financial obligations or to pay dividends.

NEP may not be able to access sources of capital on commercially reasonable terms, which would have a material adverse effect on its ability to consummate future acquisitions and on the value of NEE’s limited partner interest in NEP OpCo.

NEE understands that NEP expects, from time to time, to finance acquisitions of clean energy projects partially or wholly through the issuance of additional securities. NEP needs to be able to access the capital markets on commercially reasonable terms when acquisition opportunities arise. NEP's ability to access the capital markets is dependent on, among other factors, the overall state of the capital markets and investor appetite for investment in clean energy projects in general and NEP's common or preferred units in particular. An inability to obtain capital markets financing on commercially reasonable terms could significantly limit NEP's ability to consummate future acquisitions and to effectuate its growth strategy.

Furthermore there may not be sufficient availability under NEP OpCo's subsidiaries' revolving credit facility or other financing arrangements on commercially reasonable terms when acquisition opportunities arise. An inability to obtain the required or desired financing could significantly limit NEP's ability to consummate acquisitions and effectuate its growth strategy. If financing is available, it may be available only on terms that could significantly increase NEP's interest expense, impose additional or more restrictive covenants and reduce cash distributions to its unitholders. NEP's inability to effectively consummate future acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on NEP's ability to grow its business and make cash distributions to its unitholders.

Through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, NEE owns a limited partner interest in NEP OpCo. NEP's inability to access the capital markets on commercially reasonable terms and effectively consummate future acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on NEP's ability to grow its cash distributions to its common unitholders, including NEE, and on the value of NEE’s limited partnership interest in NEP OpCo.

Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets may exert downward pressure on the market price of NEE's common stock.

The market price and trading volume of NEE's common stock are subject to fluctuations as a result of, among other factors, general credit and capital market conditions and changes in market sentiment regarding the operations, business and financing strategies of NEE and its subsidiaries. As a result, disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets may, for example, have a material adverse effect on the market price of NEE's common stock.

Item 2.  Properties

For a description of NEE's principal properties, see Item 1. Business - FPL and Item 1. Business - NEER.

Character of Ownership

Substantially all of FPL's properties are subject to the lien of FPL's mortgage, which secures most debt securities issued by FPL. The majority of FPL's real property is held in fee and is free from other encumbrances, subject to minor exceptions which are not of a nature as to substantially impair the usefulness to FPL of such properties. Some of FPL's electric lines are located on parcels of land which are not owned in fee by FPL but are covered by necessary consents of governmental authorities or rights obtained from owners of private property. The majority of NEER's generation facilities, pipeline facilities and transmission assets are owned by NEER subsidiaries and a number of those facilities and assets, including all of the Texas pipelines, are encumbered by liens securing various financings. Additionally, the majority of NEER's generation facilities, pipeline facilities and transmission lines are located on land leased or under easement from owners of private property.

Item 5.  Market for Registrants' Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Common Stock Data.

All of FPL's common stock is owned by NEE. NEE's common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "NEE." The high and low sales prices for the common stock of NEE as reported in the consolidated transaction reporting system of the New York Stock Exchange and the cash dividends per share declared for each quarter during the past two years are as follows:

The amount and timing of dividends payable on NEE's common stock are within the sole discretion of NEE's Board of Directors. The Board of Directors reviews the dividend rate at least annually (generally in February) to determine its appropriateness in light of NEE's financial position and results of operations, legislative and regulatory developments affecting the electric utility industry in general and FPL in particular, competitive conditions, change in business mix and any other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant. The ability of NEE to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon, among other things, dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries. There are no restrictions in effect that currently limit FPL's ability to pay dividends to NEE. In February 2018, NEE announced that it would increase its quarterly dividend on its common stock from $0.9825 per share to $1.11 per share. See Management's Discussion - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Covenants with respect to dividend restrictions and Note 10 - Common Stock Dividend Restrictions regarding dividends paid by FPL to NEE.

As of the close of business on January 31, 2018, there were 18,627 holders of record of NEE's common stock.

Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

OVERVIEW

NEE’s operating performance is driven primarily by the operations of its two principal subsidiaries, FPL, which serves nearly

five million

customer accounts in Florida and is one of the largest electric utilities in the U.S., and NEER, which together with affiliated entities is the world's largest operator of wind and solar projects based on 2017 MWh produced. The table below presents net income

attributable to NEE and earnings per share attributable to NEE, assuming dilution, by reportable segment, FPL and NEER, and by

Corporate and Other, which is primarily comprised of the operating results of NEET and other business activities, as well as other income and expense items, including interest expense, income taxes and eliminating entries (

see Note


for additional segment information). The following discussions should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein and all comparisons are with the corresponding items in the prior year.

______________________

(a)

NEER’s results reflect an allocation of interest expense from NEECH based on a deemed capital structure of 70% debt.

For the five years ended

December 31, 2017

, NEE delivered a total shareholder return of approximately 162.4%, above the S&P 500’s 108.1% return, the S&P 500 Utilities' 81.1% return and the Dow Jones U.S. Electricity's 77.9% return. The historical stock performance of NEE's common stock shown in the performance graph below is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance.



Adjusted Earnings

NEE prepares its financial statements under GAAP. However, management uses earnings excluding certain items (adjusted earnings), a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, analysis of performance, reporting of results to the Board of Directors and as an input in determining performance-based compensation under NEE’s employee incentive compensation plans. NEE also uses adjusted earnings when communicating its financial results and earnings outlook to analysts and investors.

NEE

’s management believes that adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of NEE's fundamental earnings power. Although the excluded amounts are properly included in the determination of net income under GAAP, management believes that the amount and/or nature of such items make period to period comparisons of operations difficult and potentially confusing. Adjusted earnings do not represent a substitute for net income, as prepared under GAAP.

The following table provides details of the after-tax adjustments to net income considered in computing NEE's adjusted earnings discussed above.

and


, approximately $47 million of gains, $233 million of losses and $175 million of gains, respectively, are included in NEER's net income; the balance is included in Corporate and Other. The change in non-qualifying hedge activity is primarily attributable to changes in forward power and natural gas prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses as the underlying transactions were realized. In 2017, net losses associated with non-qualifying hedge activity were partly offset by approximately $95 million of tax reform impacts.

Approximately $1,925 million of net favorable tax reform impacts and $50 million of net unfavorable tax reform impacts are included in NEER's and FPL's net income, respectively; the balance is included in Corporate and Other.

(f)

Approximately $276 million of the gains is included in NEER's net income; the balance is included in Corporate and Other. See Note 1 - Assets and Liabilities Associated with Assets Held for Sale for a discussion of the sale of the natural gas generation facilities.

(g)

Approximately $246 million of the impairment charge is included in NEER's net income; the balance is included in Corporate and Other. See Note 4 - Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.

NEE segregates into two categories unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses and timing impacts related to derivative transactions. The first category, referred to as non-qualifying hedges, represents certain energy derivative, interest rate derivative and foreign currency transactions entered into as economic hedges, which do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting, or for which hedge accounting treatment is not elected or has been discontinued. Changes in the fair value of those transactions are marked to market and reported in the consolidated statements of income, resulting in earnings volatility because the economic offset to certain of the positions are generally not marked to market. As a consequence, NEE's net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically-linked transactions. For example, a gain (loss) in the non-qualifying hedge category for certain energy derivatives is offset by decreases (increases) in the fair value of related physical asset positions in the portfolio or contracts, which are not marked to market under GAAP. For this reason, NEE's management views results expressed excluding the impact of the non-qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance. The second category, referred to as trading activities, which is included in adjusted earnings, represents the net unrealized effect of actively traded positions entered into to take advantage of expected market price movements and all other commodity hedging activities. In 2016, NEE discontinued hedge accounting for its interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments, which could result in increased volatility in the non-qualifying hedge category. At FPL, substantially all changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause. See Note

3.




Summary

Net income attributable to NEE for


was higher than


by

$2,466 million

, or

$5.13

per share, assuming dilution, due to higher results at FPL, NEER and Corporate and Other, including the favorable impacts of tax reform.

FPL's increase in net income in


was primarily driven by continued investments in plant in service and other property and increased retail rate base under the 2016 rate agreement, partly offset by the net impact of storm restoration costs due to Hurricane Irma discussed below.

NEER's results increased in


primarily reflecting the impacts of tax reform, earnings from new investments and the non-qualifying hedge activity, partly offset by the Duane Arnold impairment charge and the absence of 2016 gains from the sale of natural gas generation facilities. In


, NEER added approximately


MW of new wind generating capacity,

1,596

MW of wind repowering generating capacity and


MW of solar generating capacity in the U.S., completed the sale of


MW of solar generating capacity and increased its backlog of contracted renewable development projects.

Corporate and Other's results in


increased primarily reflecting the gain on sale of the fiber-optic telecommunications business, partly offset by non-qualifying hedge activity.

NEE and its subsidiaries require funds to support and grow their businesses. These funds are primarily provided by cash flow from operations, borrowings or issuances of short- and long-term debt and proceeds from differential membership investors and, from time to time, issuances of equity securities. See Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net income attributable to NEE for


was

$5.38 billion

, compared to

$2.91 billion

in


and

$2.75 billion

in


. In


and


, net income attributable to NEE improved due to higher results at

FPL, NEER and Corporate and Other.

In 2017, the enactment of tax reform required NEE and its subsidiaries to, among other things, revalue their deferred income tax assets and liabilities to the new 21% federal corporate income tax rate. See Note 1 - Securitized Storm-Recovery Costs, Storm Fund and Storm Reserve and Note 5 for further discussion of the impacts of tax reform.

FPL: Results of Operations

FPL obtains its operating revenues primarily from the sale of electricity to retail customers at rates established by the FPSC through base rates and cost recovery clause mechanisms. FPL’s net income for


,


and


was

$1,880 million

,

$1,727 million

and

$1,648 million

, respectively, representing an increase in


of

$153 million

and an increase in


of

$79 million

. The increases in 2017 and 2016 were primarily driven by higher earnings from investments in plant in service and other property.

Such investments grew FPL's average retail rate base by approximately $3.5 billion and $2.4 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively, and reflect, among other things, ongoing transmission and distribution additions, the replacement of certain gas turbines with high-efficiency, low-emission turbines, solar generation additions and the modernized Port Everglades Clean Energy Center that was placed in service on April 1, 2016 (Port Everglades power plant).

In September 2017, Hurricane Irma passed through Florida causing damage throughout much of FPL's service territory, resulting in approximately 4.4 million of FPL's customers losing electrical service. FPL restored power to approximately 50% of its affected customers within one day and to approximately 95% of affected customers within seven days.

In December 2017, following the enactment of tax reform, FPL used available reserve amortization to offset nearly all of the write-off of Hurricane Irma storm restoration costs, and FPL plans to partially restore the reserve amortization through tax savings generated during the term of the 2016 rate agreement. See Note 1 - Securitized Storm-Recovery Costs, Storm Fund and Storm Reserve

.

The use of reserve amortization was permitted under the 2012 rate agreement and continues during the term of the 2016 rate agreement. See Item 1. Business - FPL - FPL Regulation - FPL Rate Regulation - Base Rates for additional information on the 2016 and 2012 rate agreements. In order to earn a targeted regulatory ROE, subject to limitations associated with the 2016 and 2012 rate agreements, reserve amortization is calculated using a trailing thirteen-month average of retail rate base and capital structure in conjunction with the trailing twelve months regulatory retail base net operating income, which primarily includes the retail base portion of base and other revenues, net of O&M, depreciation and amortization, interest and tax expenses. In general, the net impact of these income statement line items must be adjusted, in part, by reserve amortization to earn the targeted regulatory ROE. In certain periods, reserve amortization is reversed so as not to exceed the targeted regulatory ROE. The drivers of FPL

'

s net income not reflected in the reserve amortization calculation typically include wholesale and transmission service revenues and expenses, cost recovery clause revenues and expenses, AFUDC - equity and revenue and costs not recoverable from retail customers by the FPSC. In


and 2016, FPL recorded reserve amortization of $1,250 million and $13 million, respectively, and in


, FPL recorded the reversal of reserve amortization of approximately $15 million. FPL's regulatory ROE for


was approximately 11.08% and, for both


and


, was 11.50%.

During 2017, FPL’s operating revenues increased $1,077 million primarily related to increases of approximately $404 million in retail base revenues, $274 million in storm-related surcharge revenues and $262 million in fuel cost recovery revenues. During



2016, FPL's operating revenues decreased $756 million primarily related to decreases of approximately $755 million in fuel cost recovery revenues and $171 million in capacity clause revenues, partly offset by an increase of $154 million in retail base revenues.

Retail Base

FPL’s retail base revenues for 2017 reflect the 2016 rate agreement and for 2016 and 2015 reflect the 2012 rate agreement. In December 2016, the FPSC issued a final order approving the 2016 rate agreement which became effective January 2017 and will remain in effect until at least December 2020, establishes FPL's allowed regulatory ROE at 10.55%, with a range of 9.60% to 11.60%, and allows for retail rate base increases in 2017, 2018 and upon commencement of commercial operations at the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center and certain solar projects. See Item 1. Business - FPL - FPL Regulation - FPL Rate Regulation - Base Rates for additional information on the 2016 rate agreement.

Retail base revenues increased approximately $45 million in 2017 and $175 million in 2016 through a $216 million annualized retail base rate increase associated with the modernized Port Everglades power plant. In addition, the 2017 increase in retail base revenues reflects additional revenues of approximately $389 million related to new retail base rates under the 2016 rate agreement. In 2017 and 2016, retail base revenues were also impacted by decreases of 2.1% for each period in the average usage per retail customer and increases of 1.3% and 1.4%, respectively, in the average number of customer accounts. Despite generally favorable weather in 2017, usage per retail customer declined. Hurricane Irma contributed to the 2017 decrease in retail usage, resulting in a decrease in retail base revenues of approximately $60 million which represents a 1.0% decrease in retail base revenues. The decline in 2016 usage per retail customer was primarily due to milder weather and customer service interruptions as a result of hurricanes that impacted FPL's service territory in 2016 which had a modest negative impact on 2016 base revenue. See Note 1 - Securitized Storm-Recovery Costs, Storm Fund and Storm Reserve.

Cost Recovery Clauses

Revenues from fuel and other cost recovery clauses and pass-through costs, such as franchise fees, revenue taxes and storm-related surcharges, are largely a pass-through of costs. Such revenues also include a return on investment allowed to be recovered through the cost recovery clauses on certain assets, primarily related to certain solar and environmental projects and the unamortized balance of the regulatory asset associated with FPL's acquisition of certain generation facilities. See Item 1. Business - FPL - FPL Regulation - FPL Rate Regulation - Cost Recovery Clauses. Underrecovery or overrecovery of cost recovery clause and other pass-through costs (deferred clause and franchise expenses and revenues) can significantly affect NEE's and FPL's operating cash flows. The 2017 and 2016 net overrecoveries were approximately $82 million and $94 million, respectively, and positively affected NEE’s and FPL’s cash flows from operating activities.

The 2017 increase in fuel cost recovery revenues primarily reflects a higher average fuel factor resulting in higher revenues of approximately $258 million. The 2016 decrease in fuel cost recovery revenues is primarily due to a decrease of approximately $737 million related to a lower average fuel factor. The 2017 increase in storm-related surcharge revenues relates to FPL's recovery of eligible storm restoration costs following hurricanes impacting FPL's service territory in 2016 and replenishment of the storm reserve for a 12-month period beginning on March 1, 2017. The 2016 decrease in capacity clause revenues was largely due to reductions in purchased power and capacity expenses associated with the capacity clause.

In


,


and


, cost recovery clauses contributed approximately $120 million, $112 million and $103 million, respectively, to FPL’s net income. The increases in 2017 and 2016 primarily relate to the acquisitions of certain generation facilities in 2017 and 2015, a portion of the costs of which were recovered through cost recovery clauses. In January 2017, FPL assumed ownership of a 330 MW coal-fired generation facility located in Indiantown, Florida (Indiantown generation facility) for a purchase price of approximately $451 million (including existing debt of approximately $218 million). In September 2015, FPL assumed ownership of the Cedar Bay generation facility and terminated its long-term purchased power agreement for substantially all of the facility’s capacity and energy for a purchase price of approximately $521 million. FPL will recover the purchase price related to the Indiantown and Cedar Bay generation facilities and the associated income tax gross-up on Cedar Bay as regulatory assets which are being amortized over approximately nine years. See Note 1 - Rate Regulation for further discussion.

Other Items Impacting FPL's Consolidated Statements of Income

Fuel, Purchased Power and Interchange Expense

Fuel, purchased power and interchange expense increased $245 million and decreased $979 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase for 2017 primarily relates to approximately $314 million of higher fuel and energy prices, partly offset by a decrease of $103 million in capacity fees related in part to the Indiantown generation facility long-term purchased power agreement after FPL assumed ownership of the Indiantown generation facility. The decrease in 2016 primarily relates to approximately $453 million of lower fuel and energy prices and $27 million related to lower energy sales. In addition, FPL recognized approximately $49 million and $220 million of deferred retail fuel costs in 2017 and 2015, respectively, compared to the deferral of $11 million of retail fuel costs in 2016. The decrease in 2016 also reflects lower capacity fees of approximately $267 million related in part to the termination of the Cedar Bay generation facility long-term purchased power agreement after FPL assumed ownership of the Cedar Bay generation facility.



Storm Restoration Costs

In December 2017, following the enactment of tax reform, FPL determined that it would not seek recovery of Hurricane Irma storm restoration costs through a surcharge from customers and, as a result, the regulatory asset associated with Hurricane Irma was written off. As allowed under the 2016 rate agreement, FPL used available reserve amortization to offset nearly all of the expense, and plans to partially restore the reserve amortization through tax savings generated during the term of the 2016 rate agreement. See Note 1 - Securitized Storm-Recovery Costs, Storm Fund and Storm Reserve.

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

The major components of FPL’s depreciation and amortization expense are as follows:

Depreciation expense decreased $718 million and increased $75 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in 2017 primarily reflects approximately $1,237 million of higher reserve amortization, partly offset by higher depreciation recovered under base rates due to higher rates as a result of the 2016 rate agreement, higher storm-recovery cost amortization related to the recovery of restoration costs from hurricanes that impacted FPL's service territory in 2016 and higher plant in service balances. The reserve amortization, or reversal of such amortization, reflects adjustments to accrued asset removal costs provided under the 2016 and 2012 rate agreements in order to achieve the targeted regulatory ROE. Reserve amortization is recorded as a reduction to (or when reversed as an increase to) accrued asset removal costs which is reflected in noncurrent regulatory liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2017, no amounts remain in accrued asset removal costs related to reserve amortization.

The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2016 primarily relates to higher amortization of a regulatory asset associated with the September 2015 acquisition of the Cedar Bay generation facility and higher depreciation related to higher plant in service balances, partly offset by the absence of 2015 amortization expenses associated with analog meters.

Taxes Other Than Income Taxes and Other

Taxe

s other than income taxes and other increased

$103 million

in 2017 primarily due to higher franchise and revenue taxes, neither of which impacts net income, as well as higher

property taxes reflecting growth in plant in service balances.



NEER: Results of Operations

NEER owns, develops, constructs, manages and operates electric generation facilities in wholesale energy markets primarily in the U.S., as well as in Canada and Spain. NEER also provides full energy and capacity requirements services, engages in power and gas marketing and trading activities and invests in natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil production and pipeline infrastructure assets.

NEER’s net income less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for


,


and


was

$2,963 million

,

$1,125 million

and

$1,092 million

, respectively, resulting in an

increase

in


of

$1,838 million

and an increase in


of

$33 million

. The primary drivers, on an after-tax basis, of these changes are in the following table.

______________________

(a)

Reflects after-tax project contributions, including PTCs, ITCs and deferred income taxes and other benefits associated with convertible ITCs for wind and solar projects, as applicable, (see Note 1 - Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization, - Income Taxes and - Sale of Differential Membership Interests and Note 5), as well as income tax benefits related to the Canadian tax restructuring, but excludes allocation of interest expense or corporate general and administrative expenses. Results from projects and pipelines are included in new investments during the first twelve months of operation or ownership. Project results are included in existing assets and pipeline results are included in gas infrastructure beginning with the thirteenth month of operation or ownership.

(b)

Excludes allocation of interest expense and corporate general and administrative expenses.

(c)

Includes differential membership interest costs. Excludes unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses related to interest rate derivative contracts, which are included in change in non-qualifying hedge activity.

(d)

See Overview - Adjusted Earnings for additional information.

New Investments

In


, results from new investments increased primarily due to:

•

higher earnings of approximately $316 million, including the net effect of deferred income taxes and other benefits associated with ITCs and convertible ITCs, related to the addition of approximately 1,818 MW of wind generating capacity and 1,378 MW of solar generating capacity during or after 2016, and

•

higher earnings of approximately $44 million related to additional investments in natural gas pipeline projects.

In


, results from new investments increased primarily due to:

•

higher earnings of approximately $223 million, including deferred income tax and other benefits associated with ITCs and convertible ITCs, related to the addition of approximately 2,819 MW of wind generating capacity and 1,226 MW of solar generating capacity during or after


, and

•

higher earnings of approximately $70 million related to the acquisition of the Texas pipelines in October 2015 and additional investments in other natural gas pipeline projects.



Existing Assets

In


, results from NEER's existing asset portfolio decreased primarily due to:

•

lower results from wind and solar assets of approximately $36 million primarily reflecting an increase in the amount of earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest and the absence of 2016 income tax benefits related to the Canadian tax restructuring, offset in part by lower depreciation related to the change in useful lives of certain wind assets (see Note 1 - Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization), and

•

lower results of approximately $27 million related to the sale of certain natural gas generation facilities (see Note 1 - Assets and Liabilities Associated with Assets Held for Sale).

In


, results from NEER's existing asset portfolio decreased primarily due to:

•

lower results from wind and solar assets of approximately $40 million primarily due to lower state tax credits, the roll off of PTCs on certain wind projects after ten years of production (PTC roll off), higher project O&M expenses and an increase in the amount of earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest, offset in part by higher wind generation and income tax benefits related to the Canadian tax restructuring, and

•

lower results of $6 million related to the sale of certain natural gas generation facilities (see Note 1 - Assets and Liabilities Associated with Assets Held for Sale).

Gas Infrastructure

The decrease in gas infrastructure results in 2016 is primarily due to increased depreciation expense reflecting higher depletion rates as well as lower commodity prices.

Revaluation of Contingent Consideration

For 2016, NEER's results reflect approximately $80 million of after-tax fair value adjustments, net of amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, to reduce the contingent holdback associated with the acquisition of the Texas pipelines (see Note 7 - Texas Pipeline Business).

Interest and General and Administrative Expenses

Interest and general and administrative expenses includes interest expense, differential membership interest costs and other corporate general and administrative expenses. In


and


, interest and general and administrative expenses reflect higher borrowing costs and other costs to support the growth of the business.

Other Factors

Supplemental to the primary drivers of the changes in NEER's net income less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests discussed above, the discussion below describes changes in certain line items set forth in NEE's consolidated statements of income as they relate to NEER.

Operating Revenues

Operating revenues for


increased

$293 million

primarily due to:

•

higher revenues from new investments of approximately $318 million,

•

lower unrealized mark-to-market losses from non-qualifying hedges (approximately $71 million for 2017 compared to $273 million in 2016), and

•

higher revenues of approximately $125 million from the customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading business,

partly offset by,

•

lower revenues from existing assets of approximately $291 million primarily reflecting the sale of certain natural gas generation facilities in 2016, and

•

lower revenues from the gas infrastructure business of approximately $89 million.

Operating revenues for


decreased

$551 million

primarily due to:

•

unrealized mark-to-market losses from non-qualifying hedges of approximately $273 million for 2016 compared to $275 million of gains on such hedges for 2015, and

•

lower revenues from existing assets of approximately $409 million reflecting lower revenues from the natural gas generation facilities sold in 2016, offset in part by higher wind generation due to stronger wind resource and higher revenues at Seabrook reflecting the absence of a 2015 refueling outage,

partly offset by,

•

higher revenues from new investments of approximately $384 million.

Operating Expenses - net

Operating expenses - net for


increased

$899 million

primarily due to:

•

the absence of the 2016 gain on the sale of natural gas generation facilities of approximately $445 million,



•

the Duane Arnold impairment charge of approximately $420 million, and

•

higher operating expenses associated with new investments of approximately $167 million,

partly offset by,

•

lower depreciation expense on existing assets of approximately $98 million primarily related to the change in the estimated useful lives of certain equipment (see Note 1 - Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization) and lower depletion rates, and

•

lower fuel expense of approximately $85 million primarily related to the sale of certain natural gas generation facilities in 2016 offset in part by higher fuel purchases for the proprietary power and gas trading business.

Operating expenses - net for


decreased

$446 million

primarily due to:

•

gains of approximately $446 million primarily related to the sale of natural gas generation facilities in 2016 and the profit sharing liability amortization related to ownership interests sold to NEP, and

•

lower fuel expense of approximately $284 million primarily reflecting lower fuel expense from the natural gas generation facilities sold in 2016

,

partly offset by,

•

higher operating expenses associated with new investments of approximately $208 million,

•

higher O&M expenses reflecting higher costs associated with growth in the NEER business, and

•

higher depreciation of approximately $49 million on existing assets primarily reflecting an increase of $111 million of depreciation from the gas infrastructure business primarily related to higher depletion rates and increased production, partly offset by lower depreciation on the natural gas generation facilities sold in 2016.

Interest Expense

NEER's interest expense for 2017 increased $69 million primarily reflecting higher average debt balances reflecting growth in the business. NEER’s interest expense for 2016 increased $107 million reflecting approximately $45 million of unfavorable changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments compared to $11 million of favorable changes in 2015 and higher average debt balances reflecting growth in the business.

Benefits Associated with Differential Membership Interests - net

Benefits associated with differential membership interests - net for all periods presented reflect benefits recognized by NEER as third-party investors received their portion of the economic attributes, including income tax attributes, of the underlying wind and solar projects, net of associated costs. The increase for 2017 primarily relates to additional sales of differential membership interests in 2017 and 2016. The increase for 2016 primarily relates to lower interest costs associated with the ongoing paydown of the differential membership interest obligations, additional sales of differential membership interests and increased results of the underlying wind and solar projects. See Note 1 - Sale of Differential Membership Interests.

Gains on Disposal of Investments and Other Property - net

Gains on disposal of investments and other property - net for all periods presented primarily reflect gains on sales of securities held in NEER’s nuclear decommissioning funds.

Revaluation of Contingent Consideration

Revaluation of contingent consideration reflects 2016 fair value adjustments to reduce the contingent holdback associated with the acquisition of the Texas pipelines. Approximately $65 million of the fair value adjustments was attributable to noncontrolling interests. See Note 7 - Texas Pipeline Business.

Tax Credits, Benefits and Expenses

PTCs from wind projects and ITCs and deferred income taxes associated with convertible ITCs from solar and certain wind projects are reflected in NEER’s earnings. PTCs are recognized as wind energy is generated and sold based on a per kWh rate prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes, and were approximately $132 million, $120 million and $149 million in


,


and


, respectively. ITCs and deferred income taxes associated with convertible ITCs totaled approximately $236 million, $150 million and $89 million in


,


and


, respectively. A portion of the PTCs and ITCs have been allocated to investors in connection with sales of differential membership interests. PTCs, ITCs and deferred income taxes associated with convertible ITCs can significantly affect the effective income tax rate depending on the amount of pretax income. The amount of PTCs recognized can be significantly affected by wind generation and by PTC roll off. Also, NEE's effective income tax rate was affected by the favorable tax reform impacts in 2017 and the reversal of a noncash income tax charge associated with structuring Canadian assets in 2016. See Note 5.

NEP

In all periods presented, indirect subsidiaries of NEER sold additional ownership interests in wind and solar projects to indirect subsidiaries of NEP. See Note 1 - NextEra Energy Partners, LP.

During the third quarter of 2017, changes to NEP's governance structure were made that, among other things, enhanced NEP unitholder governance rights. The new governance structure established a NEP board of directors whereby NEP unitholders have the ability to nominate and elect board members, subject to certain limitations and requirements. As a result of these governance changes, NEP was deconsolidated from NEE in January 2018, which is when the term of office of the first NEP unitholder-elected directors took effect. As a result of the deconsolidation of NEP, NEE will reflect its ownership interest in NEP as an equity method



investment and future earnings from NEP as equity in earnings of equity method investees in its consolidated financial statements. Upon deconsolidation, the equity method investment was recorded at fair value which will result in a gain of approximately

$4 billion

(

$3 billion

after tax) to NEE in the first quarter of 2018. Additionally, sales of assets to NEP after deconsolidation will be accounted for as third-party sales.

Corporate and Other: Results of Operations

Corporate and Other is primarily comprised of the operating results of NEET and other business activities, as well as corporate interest income and expenses. Corporate and Other allocates a portion of NEECH's corporate interest expense to NEER. Interest expense is allocated based on a deemed capital structure of 70% debt and, for purposes of allocating NEECH's corporate interest expense, the deferred credit associated with differential membership interests sold by NEER’s subsidiaries is included with debt. Each subsidiary’s income taxes are calculated based on the "separate return method," except that tax benefits that could not be used on a separate return basis, but are used on the consolidated tax return, are recorded by the subsidiary that generated the tax benefits. Any remaining consolidated income tax benefits or expenses are recorded at Corporate and Other.

Corporate and Other's results increased $475 million and $48 million during 2017 and 2016. The increase for 2017 primarily relates to the approximately $685 million after-tax gain on the sale of the fiber-optic telecommunications business in January 2017. See Note 1 -

Assets and Liabilities Associated with Assets Held for Sale. In addition, Corporate and Other's results reflect 2017 after-tax losses of approximately $82 million related to non-qualifying hedge activity compared to gains of $141 million in 2016. The increase in Corporate and Other's results for 2016 primarily relates to the non-qualifying hedge activity gains on interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments and foreign currency transactions as hedge accounting was discontinued effective January 2016. See Note 3. The increase in 2016 was partly offset by higher merger-related expenses (see Note 1 - Merger Terminations) and unfavorable consolidating income tax adjustments.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

NEE and its subsidiaries require funds to support and grow their businesses. These funds are used for, among other things, working capital, capital expenditures, investments in or acquisitions of assets and businesses, payment of maturing debt obligations and, from time to time, redemption or repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities. It is anticipated that these requirements will be satisfied through a combination of cash flows from operations, short- and long-term borrowings, the issuance of short- and long-term debt and, from time to time, equity securities, and proceeds from differential membership investors, consistent with NEE’s and FPL’s objective of maintaining, on a long-term basis, a capital structure that will support a strong investment grade credit rating.

NE

E, FPL and NEECH rely on access to credit and capital markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements and other operations that are not satisfied by operating cash flows. The inability of NEE, FPL and NEECH to maintain their current credit ratings could affect their ability to raise short- and long-term capital, their cost of capital and the execution of their respective financing strategies, and could require the posting of additional collateral under certain agreements.

In October 2015, NEE authorized a program to purchase, from time to time, up to $150 million of common units representing limited partner interests in NEP. Under the program, purchases may be made in amounts, at prices and at such times as NEE or its subsidiaries deem appropriate, all subject to market conditions and other considerations. The purchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Any purchases will be made in such quantities, at such prices, in such manner and on such terms and conditions as determined by NEE or its subsidiaries in their discretion, based on factors such as market and business conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The common unit purchase program does not require NEE to acquire any specific number of common units and may be modified or terminated by NEE at any time. At

December 31, 2017

, NEE owned a controlling general partner interest in NEP and beneficially owned approximately 60.6% of NEP’s voting power. The purpose of the program is not to cause NEP’s common units to be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange or to cause the common units to be deregistered with the SEC. As of

December 31, 2017

, NEE had purchased approximately $36 million of NEP common units under this program. Also in October 2015, NEP put in place an at-the-market equity issuance program pursuant to which NEP may issue from time to time, up to $150 million of its common units. As of

December 31, 2017

, NEP had issued approximately

$41 million of its common units under this program.



Cash Flows

NEE's sources and uses of cash for


,


and


were as follows:

______________________

*Prior period amounts have been retrospectively adjusted as discussed in Note 1 - Restricted Cash.

NEE's primary capital requirements are for expanding and enhancing FPL's electric system and generation facilities to continue to provide reliable service to meet customer electricity demands and for funding NEER's investments in independent power and other projects.

See Note 13 - Commitments for estimated capital expenditures in 2018 through 2022.

The following table provides a summary of the major capital investments for


,


and


.



Liquidity

At December 31, 2017, NEE's total net available liquidity was approximately

$9.2 billion

. The table below provides the components of FPL's and NEECH's net available liquidity at December 31, 2017.

______________________

(a)

Provide for the funding of loans up to $7,880 million ($2,916 million for FPL) and the issuance of letters of credit up to $3,450 million ($670 million for FPL). The entire amount of the credit facilities is available for general corporate purposes and to provide additional liquidity in the event of a loss to the companies’ or their subsidiaries’ operating facilities (including, in the case of FPL, a transmission and distribution property loss). FPL’s bank revolving line of credit facilities are also available to support the purchase of $838 million of pollution control, solid waste disposal and industrial development revenue bonds (tax exempt bonds) in the event they are tendered by individual bond holders and not remarketed prior to maturity. Approximately $2,315 million of FPL's and $3,730 million of NEECH's bank revolving line of credit facilities expire in 2022.

(b)

Only available for the issuance of letters of credit.

At

December 31, 2017

, 68

b

anks participate in FPL’s and NEECH’s revolving credit facilities, with no one bank providing more than 7% of the combined revolving credit facilities. European banks provide approximately 24

%

of the combined revolving credit facilities. Pursuant to a 1998 guarantee agreement, NEE guarantees the payment of NEECH’s debt obligations under its revolving credit facilities.

In order for FPL or NEECH to borrow or to have letters of credit issued under the terms of their respective revolving credit facilities and, also for NEECH, its letter of credit facilities, FPL, in the case of FPL, and NEE, in the case of NEECH, are required, among other things, to maintain a ratio of funded debt to total capitalization that does not exceed a stated ratio.

The FPL and NEECH revolving credit facilities also contain default and related acceleration provisions relating to, among other things, failure of FPL and NEE, as the case may be, to maintain the respective ratio of funded debt to total capitalization at or below the specified ratio. At

December 31, 2017

, each of NEE and FPL was in compliance with its required ratio.

Capital Support

Guarantees, Letters of Credit, Surety Bonds and Indemnifications (Guarantee Arrangements)

Certain subsidiaries of NEE issue guarantees and obtain letters of credit and surety bonds, as well as provide indemnities, to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties and financings. Substantially all of the guarantee arrangements are on behalf of NEE’s consolidated subsidiaries, as discussed in more detail below. NEE is not required to recognize liabilities associated with guarantee arrangements issued on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries unless it becomes probable that they will be required to perform. At

December 31, 2017

, NEE believes that there is no material exposure related to these guarantee arrangements.

NEE subsidiaries issue guarantees related to equity contribution agreements associated with the development, construction and financing of certain power generation facilities, engineering, procurement and construction agreements and natural gas pipeline development projects. Commitments associated with these activities are included in the contracts table in Note 13.

In addition, at

December 31, 2017

, NEE subsidiaries had approximately $4.0 billion in guarantees related to obligations under purchased power agreements, nuclear-related activities, payment obligations related to PTCs, as well as other types of contractual obligations.

In some instances, subsidiaries of NEE elect to issue guarantees instead of posting other forms of collateral required under certain financing arrangements, as well as for other project-level cash management activities. At

December 31, 2017

, these guarantees totaled approximately $786 million and support, among other things, cash management activities, including those related to debt service and O&M service agreements, as well as other specific project financing requirements.



Subsidiaries of NEE also issue guarantees to support customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading activities, including the buying and selling of wholesale and retail energy commodities. At

December 31, 2017

, the estimated mark-to-market exposure (the total amount that these subsidiaries of NEE could be required to fund based on energy commodity market prices at

December 31, 2017

) plus contract settlement net payables, net of collateral posted for obligations under these guarantees totaled approximately $720 million.

At

December 31, 2017

, subsidiaries of NEE also had approximately $1.3 billion of standby letters of credit and approximately $311 million of surety bonds to support certain of the commercial activities discussed above. FPL's and NEECH's credit facilities are available to support the amount of the standby letters of credit.

In addition, as part of contract negotiations in the normal course of business, certain subsidiaries of NEE have agreed and in the future may agree to make payments to compensate or indemnify other parties, including those associated with asset divestitures, for possible unfavorable financial consequences resulting from specified events. The specified events may include, but are not limited to, an adverse judgment in a lawsuit or the imposition of additional taxes due to a change in tax law or interpretations of the tax law or the triggering of cash grant recapture provisions under the Recovery Act. NEE is unable to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under some of these contracts because events that would obligate them to make payments have not yet occurred or, if any such event has occurred, they have not been notified of its occurrence.

Certain guarantee arrangements described above contain requirements for NEECH and FPL to maintain a specified credit rating. For a discussion of credit rating downgrade triggers see Credit Ratings below. NEE has guaranteed certain payment obligations of NEECH, including most of its debt and all of its debentures and commercial paper issuances, as well as most of its payment guarantees and indemnifications, and NEECH has guaranteed certain debt and other obligations of NEER and its subsidiaries.

Shelf Registration

In July 2015, NE

E, NEECH and FPL filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC for an unspecified amount of securities which became effective upon filing. The amount of securities issuable by the companies is established from time to time by their respective boards of directors. Securities that may be issued under the registration statement include, depending on the registrant, senior debt securities, subordinated debt securities, junior subordinated debentures, first mortgage bonds, common stock, preferred stock, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units, warrants and guarantees related to certain of those securities.



Contractual Obligations and Estimated Capital Expenditures

NEE’s commitments at

December 31, 2017

were as follows:

_________________________

(a)

Includes principal, interest, interest rate contracts and payments by NEE under stock purchase contracts. Variable rate interest was computed using

December 31, 2017

rates. See Note 11.

(b)

Includes tax exempt bonds of approximately $9 million maturing in 2020, $46 million in 2021, $96 million in 2022 and $687 million thereafter that permit individual bond holders to tender the bonds for purchase at any time prior to maturity. In the event bonds are tendered for purchase, they would be remarketed by a designated remarketing agent in accordance with the related indenture. If the remarketing is unsuccessful, FPL would be required to purchase the tax exempt bonds. As of

December 31, 2017

, all tax exempt bonds tendered for purchase have been successfully remarketed. FPL’s bank revolving line of credit facilities are available to support the purchase of tax exempt bonds.

(c)

Represents required capacity and minimum charges under long-term purchased power and fuel contracts and projected capital expenditures through 2022 (see Note 13 - Commitments and - Contracts).

(d)

See Note 13 - Contracts.

(e)

Represents expected cash payments adjusted for inflation for estimated costs to perform asset retirement activities.

(f)

At

December 31, 2017

, FPL had approximately $4,089 million in restricted funds for the payment of its portion of future expenditures to decommission the Turkey Point and St. Lucie nuclear units, which are included in NEE’s and FPL’s special use funds. See Note 12.

(g)

At

December 31, 2017

, NEER had approximately $1,913 million in restricted funds for the payment of its portion of future expenditures to decommission Seabrook, Duane Arnold and Point Beach nuclear units which are included in NEE’s special use funds. See Note 12.

(h)

Represents estimated cash distributions related to differential membership interests and payments related to the acquisition of certain development rights. For further discussion of differential membership interests, see Note 1 - Sale of Differential Membership Interests.

Credit Ratings

NEE’s liquidity, ability to access credit and capital markets, cost of borrowings and collateral posting requirements under certain agreements is dependent on its and its subsidiaries credit ratings. At

February 16, 2018

, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody’s), S&P Global Ratings (S&P) and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (Fitch) had assigned the following credit ratings to NEE, FPL and NEECH:

_________________________

(a)

A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization.

(b)

The outlook indicated by each of Moody's, S&P and Fitch is stable.

(c)

Short-term ratings are presented as all bonds outstanding are currently paying a short-term interest rate. At FPL's election, a portion or all of the bonds may be adjusted to a long-term interest rate.



NEE and its subsidiaries have no credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt. A change in ratings is not an event of default under applicable debt instruments, and while there are conditions to drawing on the credit facilities noted above, the maintenance of a specific minimum credit rating is not a condition to drawing on these credit facilities.

Commitment fees and interest rates on loans under these credit facilities’ agreements are tied to credit ratings. A ratings downgrade also could reduce the accessibility and increase the cost of commercial paper and other short-term debt issuances and borrowings and additional or replacement credit facilities. In addition, a ratings downgrade could result in, among other things, the requirement that NEE subsidiaries post collateral under certain agreements and guarantee arrangements, including, but not limited to, those related to fuel procurement, power sales and purchases, nuclear decommissioning funding, debt-related reserves and trading activities. FPL’s and NEECH’s credit facilities are available to support these potential requirements.

Covenants

NEE's charter does not limit the dividends that may be paid on its common stock. As a practical matter, the ability of NEE to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon, among other things, dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries. For example, FPL pays dividends to NEE in a manner consistent with FPL's long-term targeted capital structure. However, the mortgage securing FPL's first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends to NEE and the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds. Additionally, in some circumstances, the mortgage restricts the amount of retained earnings that FPL can use to pay cash dividends on its common stock. The restricted amount may change based on factors set out in the mortgage. Other than this restriction on the payment of common stock dividends, the mortgage does not restrict FPL's use of retained earnings. At

December 31, 2017

, no retained earnings were restricted by these provisions of the mortgage and, in light of FPL's current financial condition and level of earnings, management does not expect that planned financing activities or dividends would be affected by these limitations.

FPL may issue first mortgage bonds under its mortgage subject to its meeting an adjusted net earnings test set forth in the mortgage, wh

ich generally requires adjusted net earnings to be at least twice the annual interest requirements on, or at least 10% of the aggregate principal amount of, FPL’s first mortgage bonds including those to be issued and any other non-junior FPL indebtedness. At

December 31, 2017

, coverage for the 12 months ended

December 31, 2017

would have been approximately 9.5 times the annual interest requirements and approximately 4.6 times the aggregate principal requirements. New first mortgage bonds are also limited to an amount equal to the sum of 60% of unfunded property additions after adjustments to offset property retirements, the amount of retired first mortgage bonds or qualified lien bonds and the amount of cash on deposit with the mortgage trustee. At

December 31, 2017

, FPL could have issued in excess of $22 billion of additional first mortgage bonds based on the unfunded property additions and retired first mortgage bonds. At

December 31, 2017

, no cash was deposited with the mortgage trustee for these purposes.

In September 2006, NEE and NEECH executed a Replacement Capital Covenant (as amended, September 2006 RCC) in connection with NEECH's offering of $350 million principal amount of Series B Enhanced Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 (Series B junior subordinated debentures). The September 2006 RCC is for the benefit of persons that buy, hold or sell a specified series of long-term indebtedness (covered debt) of NEECH (other than the Series B junior subordinated debentures) or, in certain cases, of NEE. NEECH's 3.625% Debentures, Series due June 15, 2023 have been designated as the covered debt under the September 2006 RCC. The September 2006 RCC provides that NEECH may redeem, and NEE or NEECH may purchase, any Series B junior subordinated debentures on or before October 1, 2036, only to the extent that the redemption or purchase price does not exceed a specified amount of proceeds from the sale of qualifying securities, subject to certain limitations described in the September 2006 RCC. Qualifying securities are securities that have equity-like characteristics that are the same as, or more equity-like than, the Series B junior subordinated debentures at the time of redemption or purchase, which are sold within 365 days prior to the date of the redemption or repurchase of the Series B junior subordinated debentures.

In June 2007, NEE and NEECH executed a Replacement Capital Covenant (as amended, June 2007 RCC) in connection with NEECH's offering of $400 million principal amount of its Series C Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2067 (Series C junior subordinated debentures). The June 2007 RCC is for the benefit of persons that buy, hold or sell a specified series of covered debt of NEECH (other than the Series C junior subordinated debentures) or, in certain cases, of NEE. NEECH's 3.625% Debentures, Series due June 15, 2023 have been designated as the covered debt under the June 2007 RCC. The June 2007 RCC provides that NEECH may redeem or purchase, or satisfy, discharge or defease (collectively, defease), and NEE and any majority-owned subsidiary of NEE or NEECH may purchase, any Series C junior subordinated debentures on or before June 15, 2037, only to the extent that the principal amount defeased or the applicable redemption or purchase price does not exceed a specified amount raised from the issuance, during the 365 days prior to the date of that redemption, purchase or defeasance, of qualifying securities that have equity-like characteristics that are the same as, or more equity-like than, the applicable characteristics of the Series C junior subordinated debentures at the time of redemption, purchase or defeasance, subject to certain limitations described in the June 2007 RCC.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

NEE’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, which were prepared under GAAP. Critical accounting policies are those that NEE believes are both most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations, and require complex, subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.

NEE considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements:

Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities

NEE uses derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity, as well as interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated primarily with outstanding and expected future debt issuances and borrowings. In addition, NEE, through NEER, uses derivatives to optimize the value of its power generation and gas infrastructure assets and engages in power and

gas

marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements.

Nature of Accounting Estimates

Accounting pronouncements require the use of fair value accounting if certain conditions are met, which requires significant judgment to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities. This applies not only to traditional financial derivative instruments, but to any contract having the accounting characteristics of a derivative. As a result, significant judgment must be used in applying derivatives accounting guidance to contracts. In the event changes in interpretation occur, it is possible that contracts that currently are excluded from derivatives accounting rules would have to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in the fair value recorded in the statement of income.

Assumptions and Accounting Approach

Derivative instruments, when required to be marked to market, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value using a combination of market and income approaches. Fair values for some of the longer-term contracts where liquid markets are not available are derived through the use of industry-standard valuation techniques, such as internally developed models which estimate the fair value of a contract by calculating the present value of the difference between the contract price and the forward prices. Forward prices represent the price at which a buyer or seller could contract today to purchase or sell a commodity at a future date.

The near-term forward market for electricity is generally liquid and therefore the prices in the early years of the forward curves reflect observable market quotes. However, in the later years, the market is much less liquid and forward price curves must be developed using factors including the forward prices for the commodities used as fuel to generate electricity, the expected system heat rate (which measures the efficiency of power plants in converting fuel to electricity) in the region where the purchase or sale takes place, and a fundamental forecast of expected spot prices based on modeled supply and demand in the region. NEE estimates the fair value of interest rate and foreign currency derivatives using an income approach based on a discounted cash flows valuation technique utilizing

the net



amount of estimated future cash inflows and outflows related to the derivative agreements. The assumptions in these models are critical since any changes therein could have a significant impact on the fair value of the derivative.

At FPL, substantially all changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the

fuel clause

. See Note 3.

In NEE’s non-rate regulated operations, predominantly NEER, essentially all changes in the derivatives’ fair value for power purchases and sales, fuel sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in operating revenues; fuel purchases used in the production of electricity are recognized in fuel, purchased power and interchange expense; and the equity method investees’ related activity is recognized in equity in earnings of equity method investees in NEE’s consolidated statements of income.

In January 2016, NEE discontinued hedge accounting for its cash flow and fair value hedges related to interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments and, therefore, all changes in the derivatives' fair value are recognized in interest expense in NEE's consolidated statements of income. NEE estimates the fair value of these derivatives using an income approach based on a discounted cash flows valuation technique utilizing observable inputs.

Certain derivative transactions at NEER are entered into as economic hedges but the transactions do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting, hedge accounting treatment is not elected or hedge accounting has been discontinued.

Changes in the fair value of those transactions are marked to market and reported in the consolidated statements of income, resulting in earnings volatility. These changes in fair value are reflected in the non-qualifying hedge category in computing adjusted earnings and could be significant to NEER’s results because the economic offset to the positions are not marked to market. As a consequence, NEE's net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically-linked transactions. For example, a gain (loss) in the non-qualifying hedge category for certain energy derivatives is offset by decreases (increases) in the fair value of related physical asset positions in the portfolio or contracts, which are not marked to market under GAAP. For this reason, NEE’s management views results expressed excluding the unrealized mark-to-market impact of the non-qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance. For additional information regarding derivative instruments, see Note 3, Overview and Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk Sensitivity.

Accounting for Pension Benefits

NEE sponsors a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of NEE and its subsidiaries. Management believes that, based on actuarial assumptions and the well-funded status of the pension plan, NEE will not be required to make any cash contributions to the qualified pension plan in the near future. The qualified pension plan has a fully funded trust dedicated to providing benefits under the plan. NEE allocates net periodic income associated with the pension plan to its subsidiaries annually using specific criteria.

Nature of Accounting Estimates

For the pension plan, the benefit obligation is the actuarial present value, as of the December 31 measurement date, of all benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered to that date. The amount of benefit to be paid depends on a number of future events incorporated into the pension benefit formula, including an estimate of the average remaining life of employees/survivors as well as the average years of service rendered. The projected benefit obligation is measured based on assumptions concerning future interest rates and future employee compensation levels. NEE derives pension income from actuarial calculations based on the plan’s provisions and various management assumptions including discount rate, rate of increase in compensation levels and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.

Assumptions and Accounting Approach

Accounting guidance requires recognition of the funded status of the pension plan in the balance sheet, with changes in the funded status recognized in other comprehensive income within shareholders’ equity in the year in which the changes occur. Since NEE is the plan sponsor, and its subsidiaries do not have separate rights to the plan assets or direct obligations to their employees, this accounting guidance is reflected at NEE and not allocated to the subsidiaries. The portion of previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs or credits that are estimated to be allocable to FPL as net periodic (income) cost in future periods and that otherwise would be recorded in AOCI are classified as regulatory assets and liabilities at NEE in accordance with regulatory treatment.



Net periodic pension income is included in O&M expenses, and is calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Those assumptions for the years ended

December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015

include:

In developing these assumptions, NEE evaluated input, including other qualitative and quantitative factors, from its actuaries and consultants, as well as information available in the marketplace. In addition, for the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, NEE considered different models, capital market return assumptions and historical returns for a portfolio with an equity/bond asset mix similar to

its pension fund, as well as its pension fund's historical compounded returns. NEE believes that

7.35%

is a reasonable long-term rate of return, net of investment management f

ees, on its pension plan assets. NEE will continue to evaluate all of its actuarial assumptions, including its expected rate of return, at least annually, and will adjust them as appropriate.

NEE utilizes in its determination of pension income a market-related valuation of plan assets. This market-related valuation reduces year-to-year volatility and recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period following the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of plan assets and the actual return realized on those plan assets. Since the market-related value of plan assets recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future value of plan assets will be affected as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized. Such gains and losses together with other differences between actual results and the estimates used in the actuarial valuations are deferred and recognized in determining pension income only to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of projected benefit obligations or the market-related value of plan assets.

The following table illustrates the effect on net periodic pension income of changing the critical actuarial assumptions discussed above, while holding all other assumptions constant:

NEE also utilizes actuarial assumptions about mortality to help estimate obligations of the pension plan. NEE has adopted the latest revised mortality tables and mortality improvement scales released by the Society of Actuaries, which did not have a material impact on the pension plan's obligation.

See Note 2.

Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets

NEE evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

Nature of Accounting Estimates

The amount of future net cash flows, the timing of the cash flows and the determination of an appropriate interest rate all involve estimates and judgments about future events. In particular, the aggregate amount of cash flows determines whether an impairment exists, and the timing of the cash flows is critical in determining fair value. Because each assessment is based on the facts and circumstances associated with each long-lived asset, the effects of changes in assumptions cannot be generalized.

Assumptions and Accounting Approach

An impairment loss is required to be recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows associated with that asset. The impairment loss to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds the asset’s fair value. In most instances, the fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate interest rate. See Note 4 - Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.



Decommissioning and Dismantlement

NEE accounts for asset retirement obligations and conditional asset retirement obligations (collectively, AROs) under accounting guidance that requires a liability for the fair value of an ARO to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if it can be reasonably estimated, with the offsetting associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets.

Nature of Accounting Estimates

The calculation of the future cost of retiring long-lived assets, including nuclear decommissioning and plant dismantlement costs, involves estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures and making judgments concerning whether or not such costs are considered a legal obligation. Estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures includes, among other things, making projections of when assets will be retired and ultimately decommissioned and how costs will escalate with inflation. In addition, NEE also makes interest rate and rate of return projections on its investments in determining recommended funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning costs. Periodically, NEE is required to update these estimates and projections which can affect the annual expense amounts recognized, the liabilities recorded and the annual funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning costs. For example, an increase of 0.25% in the assumed escalation rates for nuclear decommissioning costs would increase NEE’s AROs at

December 31, 2017

by

$177 million

.

Assumptions and Accounting Approach

FPL -

For ratemaking purpos

es, FPL accrues and funds for nuclear plant decommissioning costs over the expected service life of each unit based on studies that are approved by the FPSC. The studies reflect, among other things, the expiration dates of the operating licenses for FPL’s nuclear units. The most recent studies, filed in 2015, indicate that FPL’s portion of the future cost of decommissioning its four nuclear units, including spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the DOE under the spent fuel settlement agreement, is approximately

$7.5 billion

, or

$3.1 billion

expressed in


dollars.

FPL accrues the cost of dismantling its fossil and solar plants over the expected service life of each unit based on studies filed with the FPSC. Unlike nuclear decommissioning, dismantlement costs are not funded. The most recent studies became effective January 1, 2017. At

December 31, 2017

, FPL’s portion of the ultimate cost to dismantle its fossil and solar units is approximately

$1.2 billion

, or

$497 million

expressed in


dollars. The majority of the dismantlement costs are not considered AROs. FPL accrues for interim removal costs over the life of the related assets based on depreciation studies approved by the FPSC. Any differences between the ARO amou

nt recorded and the amount recorded for ratemaking purposes are reported as a regulatory liability in accordance with regulatory accounting.

The components of FPL’s decommissioning of nuclear plants, dismantlement of plants and other accrued asset removal costs are as follows:

______________________

(a)

Included in noncurrent regulatory liabilities on NEE’s and FPL’s consolidated balance sheets.

(b)

Represents total amount accrued for ratemaking purposes.

NEER -

NEER records liabilities for the present value of its expected nuclear plant decommissioning costs which are determined using various internal and external data and applying a probability percentage to a variety of scenarios regarding the life of the plant and timing of decommissioning. The liabilities are being accreted using the interest method through the date decommissioning activities are expected to be complete. At

December 31, 2017

, the AROs for decommissioning of NEER’s nuclear plants totaled approximately

$552 million

. NEER’s portion of the ultimate cost of decommissioning its nuclear plants, including costs associated with spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the DOE under the spent fuel settlement agreement, is estimated to be approximately

$10.8 billion

, or

$2.0 billion

expressed in


dollars.

See Note 1 - Asset Retirement Obligations and - Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs and Note 12.



Regulatory Accounting

Certain of NEE's businesses are subject to rate regulation which results in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities. See Note 1 - Rate Regulation for a detail of NEE’s regulatory assets and liabilities.

Nature of Accounting Estimates

Regulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory assets and liabilities are included in rate base or otherwise earn (pay) a return on investment during the recovery period.

Assumptions and Accounting Approach

Accounting guidance allows regulators to create assets and impose liabilities that would not be recorded by non-rate regulated entities. If NEE's rate-regulated entities, primarily FPL, were no longer subject to cost-based rate regulation, the existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or refund. In addition, the regulators, including the FPSC for FPL, have the authority to disallow recovery of costs that they consider excessive or imprudently incurred. Such costs may include, among others, fuel and O&M expenses, the cost of replacing power lost when fossil and nuclear units are unavailable, storm restoration costs and costs associated with the construction or acquisition of new facilities. The continued applicability of regulatory accounting is assessed at each reporting period.

ENERGY MARKETING AND TRADING AND MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY

NEE and FPL are exposed to risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, interest rates and equity prices.

Financial instruments and positions affecting the financial statements of NEE and FPL described below are held primarily for purposes other than trading. Market risk is measured as the potential loss in fair value resulting from hypothetical reasonably possible changes in commodity prices, interest rates or equity prices over the next year.

Management has established risk management policies to monitor and manage such market risks, as well as credit risks.

Commodity Price Risk

NEE and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity. In addition, NEE, through NEER, uses derivatives to optimize the value of its power generation and gas infrastructure assets and engages in power and

gas

marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities and Note 3.

During


and


, the changes in the fair value of NEE’s consolidated subsidiaries’ energy contract derivative instruments were as follows:



NEE’s total mark-to-market energy contract net assets (liabilities) at

December 31, 2017

shown above are included on the consolidated balance sheets as follows:

The sources of fair value estimates and maturity of energy contract derivative instruments at

December 31, 2017

were as follows:

With respect to commodities, NEE’s Exposure Management Committee (EMC), which is comprised of certain members of senior management, and NEE's chief executive officer are responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels. The EMC and NEE's chief executive officer receive periodic updates on market positions and related exposures, credit exposures and overall risk management activities.

NEE uses a value-at-risk (VaR) model to measure commodity price market risk in its trading and mark-to-market portfolios. The VaR is the estimated nominal loss of market value based on a one-day holding period at a 95% confidence level using historical simulation methodology. The VaR figures are as follows:

______________________

(a)

Non-qualifying hedges are employed to reduce the market risk exposure to physical assets or contracts which are not marked to market. The VaR figures for the non-qualifying hedges and hedges in FPL cost recovery clauses category do not represent the economic exposure to commodity price movements.



Interest Rate Risk

NEE's and FPL's financial results are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of their respective outstanding a

nd expected future issuances of d

ebt, investments in special use funds and other investments. NEE and FPL manage their respective interest rate exposure by monitoring current interest rates, entering into interest rate contracts and using a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt. Interest rate contracts are used to mitigate and adjust interest rate exposure when deemed appropriate based upon market conditions or when required by financing agreements.

The following are estimates of the fair value of NEE's and FPL's financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk:

______________________

(a)

Primarily estimated using a market approach based on quoted market prices for these or similar issues.

(b)

At December 31, 2017, the note receivable is classified as held for sale and is under contract (see Note 8

-

NEER).

(c)

Primarily estimated using an income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow valuation technique based on certain observable yield curves and indices considering the credit profile of the borrower.

(d)

Estimated using either a market approach based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or an income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow valuation technique, considering the current credit profile of the debtor.

(e)

Modeled internally using an income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow valuation technique and applying a credit valuation adjustment.

The special use funds of NEE and FPL consist of restricted funds set aside to cover the cost of storm damage for FPL and for the decommissioning of NEE's and FPL's nuclear power plants. See Note 1 - Securitized Storm-Recovery Costs, Storm Fund and Storm Reserve. A portion of these funds is invested in fixed income debt securities primarily carried at estimated fair value. At FPL, changes in fair value, including any OTTI losses, result in a corresponding adjustment to the related liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment. The changes in fair value of NEE's non-rate regulated operations result in a corresponding adjustment to OCI, except for impairments deemed to be other than temporary, including any credit losses, which are reported in current period earnings. Because the funds set aside by FPL for storm damage could be needed at any time, the related investments are generally more liquid and, therefore, are less sensitive to changes in interest rates. The nuclear decommissioning funds, in contrast, are generally invested in longer-term securities, as decommissioning activities are not scheduled to begin in the near term.

At

December 31, 2017

, NEE had interest rate contracts with a notional amount of approximately $

12.1 billion

related to outstanding and expected future debt issuances and borrowings, of which $9.7 billion manages exposure to the variability of cash flows associated with outstanding and expected future debt issuances at NEECH and NEER. The remaining $2.4 billion of notional amount of interest rate contracts effectively convert fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt instruments at NEECH. See Note 3.

Based upon a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates, which is a reasonable near-term market change, the fair value of NEE’s net liabilities would increase by approximately $1,489 million ($478 million for FPL) at

December 31, 2017

.

Equity Price Risk

NEE and FPL are exposed to risk resulting from changes in prices for equity securities. For example, NEE’s nuclear decommissioning reserve funds include marketable equity securities primarily carried at their market value of approximately

$3,314 million

and

$2,913 million

(

$2,035 million

and

$1,745 million

for FPL) at

December 31, 2017 and 2016

, respectively. NEE's and FPL’s investment strategy for equity securities in their nuclear decommissioning reserve funds emphasizes primarily marketable securities which are broadly diversified. At

December 31, 2017

, a hypothetical 10% decrease in the prices quoted by stock exchanges, which is a reasonable near-term market change, would result in a $305 million ($186 million for FPL) reduction in fair value. For FPL, a corresponding adjustment would be made to the related liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment, and for NEE’s non-rate regulated operations, a corresponding adjustment would be made to OCI to the extent the market value of the securities exceeded amortized cost and to OTTI loss to the extent the market value is below amortized cost. See Note 4 - Financial Instruments Accounting Standards Update.



Credit Risk

NEE and its subsidiaries are also exposed to credit risk through their energy marketing and trading operations. Credit risk is the risk that a financial loss will be incurred if a counterparty to a transaction does not fulfill its financial obligation. NEE manages counterparty credit risk for its subsidiaries with energy marketing and trading operations through established policies, including counterparty credit limits, and in some cases credit enhancements, such as cash prepayments, letters of credit, cash and other collateral and guarantees.

Credit risk is also managed through the use of master netting agreements. NEE’s credit department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates, both on an individual and an aggregate basis. For all derivative and contractual transactions, NEE’s energy marketing and trading operations, which include FPL's energy marketing and trading division, are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these transactions. Some relevant considerations when assessing NEE’s energy marketing and trading operations’ credit risk exposure include the following:

•

Operations are primarily concentrated in the energy industry.

•

Trade receivables and other financial instruments are predominately with energy, utility and financial services related companies, as well as municipalities, cooperatives and other trading companies in the U.S.

•

Overall credit risk is managed through established credit policies and is overseen by the EMC.

•

Prospective and existing customers are reviewed for creditworthiness based upon established standards, with customers not meeting minimum standards providing various credit enhancements or secured payment terms, such as letters of credit or the posting of margin cash collateral.

•

Master netting agreements are used to offset cash and noncash gains and losses arising from derivative instruments with the same counterparty. NEE’s policy is to have master netting agreements in place with significant counterparties.

Based on NEE’s policies and risk exposures related to credit, NEE and FPL do not anticipate a material adverse effect on their financial statements as a result of counterparty nonperformance. At

December 31, 2017

, approximately

92%

of NEE’s and

100%

of FPL's energy marketing and trading counterparty credit risk exposure is associated with companies that have investment grade credit ratings.

Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

NextEra Energy, Inc.'s (NEE) and Florida Power & Light Company's (FPL) management are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The consolidated financial statements, which in part are based on informed judgments and estimates made by management, have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis.

To aid in carrying out this responsibility, we, along with all other members of management, maintain a system of internal accounting control which is established after weighing the cost of such controls against the benefits derived. In the opinion of management, the overall system of internal accounting control provides reasonable assurance that the assets of NEE and FPL and their subsidiaries are safeguarded and that transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorization and are properly recorded for the preparation of financial statements. In addition, management believes the overall system of internal accounting control provides reasonable assurance that material errors or irregularities would be prevented or detected on a timely basis by employees in the normal course of their duties. Any system of internal accounting control, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations, including the possibility that controls can be circumvented or overridden and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time. Accordingly, even an effective system of internal control will provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting.

The system of internal accounting control is supported by written policies and guidelines, the selection and training of qualified employees, an organizational structure that provides an appropriate division of responsibility and a program of internal auditing. NEE's written policies include a Code of Business Conduct & Ethics that states management's policy on conflicts of interest and ethical conduct. Compliance with the Code of Business Conduct & Ethics is confirmed annually by key personnel.

The Board of Directors pursues its oversight responsibility for financial reporting and accounting through its Audit Committee. This Committee, which is comprised entirely of independent directors, meets regularly with management, the internal auditors and the independent auditors to make inquiries as to the manner in which the responsibilities of each are being discharged. The independent auditors and the internal audit staff have free access to the Committee without management's presence to discuss auditing, internal accounting control and financial reporting matters.

Management assessed the effectiveness of NEE's and FPL's internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2017

, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in the

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

. Based on this assessment, management believes that NEE's and FPL's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2017

.

NEE's and FPL's independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, is engaged to express an opinion on NEE's and FPL's consolidated financial statements and an opinion on NEE's and FPL's internal control over financial reporting. Their reports are based on procedures believed by them to provide a reasonable basis to support such opinions. These reports appear on the following pages.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of

NextEra Energy, Inc. and Florida Power & Light Company

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of NextEra Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries (NEE) and Florida Power & Light Company and subsidiaries (FPL) as of

December 31, 2017

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, NEE and FPL maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 of NEE and FPL and our report dated February 16, 2018 expressed unqualified opinions on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

NEE's and FPL’s management are responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for their assessments of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on NEE’s and FPL’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to NEE and FPL in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies

Basis of Presentation

- The operations of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) are conducted primarily through Florida Power & Light Company (FPL), a wholly owned subsidiary, and NextEra Energy Resources, LLC (NEER), a wholly owned indirect subsidiary. FPL, a rate-regulated electric utility, supplies electric service to nearly

five million

customer accounts throughout most of the east and lower west coasts of Florida. NEER invests in independent power projects through both controlled and consolidated entities and noncontrolling ownership interests in joint ventures essentially all of which are accounted for under the equity method. NEER also participates in natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil production primarily through non-operating ownership interests and in pipeline infrastructure through either wholly owned subsidiaries or noncontrolling or joint venture interests.

The consolidated financial statements of NEE and FPL include the accounts of their respective majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts included in prior years' consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation. The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

NextEra Energy Partners, LP

- NextEra Energy Partners, LP (NEP) was formed in 2014. NEP acquires, manages and owns contracted clean energy projects with stable, long-term cash flows through a limited partner interest in NextEra Energy Operating Partners, LP (NEP OpCo). At December 31, 2017, NEE owned a controlling general partner interest in NEP and consolidated NEP for financial reporting purposes (see below for discussion of deconsolidation of NEP). NEE presented its limited partner interests in NEP as a noncontrolling interest in NEE's consolidated financial statements. Certain equity and asset transactions between NEP, NEER and NEP OpCo involve the exchange of cash, energy projects and ownership interests in NEP OpCo. These exchanges were accounted for under the profit sharing method and resulted in a profit sharing liability, net of amortization, of approximately $

866 million

and $

757 million

at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively, which is reflected in noncurrent other liabilities on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. In 2016 and 2017, a portion of the profit sharing liability was amortized into income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the underlying energy projects held by NEP OpCo. Accordingly, the profit sharing liability amortization totaled approximately $

28 million

and $

37 million

during 2017 and 2016 and is included in taxes other than income taxes and other - net in NEE’s consolidated statements of income (see Accounting for Partial Sales of Nonfinancial Assets below

)

.

Upon completion of NEP's initial public offering (IPO) in July 2014, NEE, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary had a

79.9%

interest in NEP's operating projects. Since the IPO, NEP has sold

35,527,435

common units and purchased

35,527,435

NEP OpCo common units. Also, in 2015, a subsidiary of NEE purchased

27,000,000

of NEP OpCo's common units. After giving effect to these transactions, NEE’s partnership interest in NEP OpCo's operating projects based on the number of outstanding NEP OpCo common units is approximately

65.1%

at

December 31, 2017

. At

December 31, 2017

, NEP, through NEER's contribution of energy projects to NEP OpCo, owns or has an interest in a portfolio of


wind and solar projects with generating capacity totaling approximately

3,728

megawatts (MW), as well as a portfolio of seven long-term contracted natural gas pipeline assets located in Texas.

In October 2015, NEE authorized a program to purchase, from time to time, up to $

150 million

of common units representing limited partner interests in NEP. Under the program, purchases may be made in amounts, at prices and at such times as NEE or its subsidiaries deem appropriate, all subject to market conditions and other considerations. The common unit purchase program does not require NEE to acquire any specific number of common units and may be modified or terminated by NEE at any time. The purchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. As of

December 31, 2017

, NEE had purchased approximately $

36 million

of NEP common units under this program.

During the third quarter of 2017, changes to NEP's governance structure were made that, among other things, enhanced NEP unitholder governance rights. The new governance structure established a NEP board of directors whereby NEP unitholders have the ability to nominate and elect board members, subject to certain limitations and requirements. As a result of these governance changes, NEP was deconsolidated from NEE in January 2018, which is when the term of office of the first NEP unitholder-elected directors took effect. As a result of the deconsolidation of NEP, NEE will reflect its ownership interest in NEP as an equity method investment and future earnings from NEP as equity in earnings of equity method investees in its consolidated financial statements. Upon deconsolidation, the equity method investment was recorded at fair value which resulted in a gain of approximately $

4 billion

($

3 billion

after tax) and will be recorded in NEE's condensed consolidated statements of income during the three months ended March 31, 2018. Additionally, sales of assets to NEP after deconsolidation will be accounted for as third-party sales.

Rate Regulation

- FPL is subject to rate regulation by the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Its rates are designed to recover the cost of providing electric service to its customers including a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. As a result of this cost-based regulation, FPL follows the accounting guidance that allows regulators to create assets and impose liabilities that would not be recorded by non-rate regulated entities. Regulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process.



NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NEE's and FPL's regulatory assets and liabilities are as follows:

Cost recovery clauses, which are designed to permit full recovery of certain costs and provide a return on certain assets allowed to be recovered through various clauses, include substantially all fuel, purchased power and interchange expense, certain costs associated with the acquisition of certain generation facilities, certain construction-related costs for certain of FPL's solar generation facilities, and conservation and certain environmental-related costs.

Revenues from cost recovery clauses are recorded when billed; FPL achieves matching of costs and related revenues by deferring the net underrecovery or overrecovery. Any underrecovered costs or overrecovered revenues are collected from or returned to customers in subsequent periods.

In 2015, FPL assumed ownership of a

250 MW

coal-fired generation facility located in Jacksonville, Florida (Cedar Bay generation facility) and terminated its long-term purchased power agreement for substantially all of the facility’s capacity and energy for a purchase price of approximately

$521 million

. The FPSC approved a stipulation and settlement between the State of Florida Office of Public Counsel (OPC) and FPL regarding issues relating to the ratemaking treatment for the Cedar Bay generation facility which provides for recovery of the purchase price and associated income tax gross-up as a regulatory asset of approximately

$847 million

which will be amortized over approximately

nine years

. At

December 31, 2017 and 2016

, the regulatory assets, net of amortization, totaled approximately

$636 million

and

$726 million

, respectively, and are included in current and noncurrent regulatory assets on NEE’s and FPL’s consolidated balance sheets. This settlement also reduced the reserve amount that was available for amortization under the 2012 rate agreement by

$30 million

to

$370 million

. See Revenues and Rates - FPL Rates Effective January 2013 through December 2016 below. In December 2016, FPL retired the Cedar Bay generation facility.

In 2017, FPL assumed ownership of a

330 MW

coal-fired generation facility located in Indiantown, Florida (Indiantown generation facility) for a purchase price of

$451 million

(including existing debt of approximately

$218 million

). FPL recorded a regulatory asset for approximately

$451 million

, which is being amortized over

nine years

. Prior to assuming ownership of this facility, FPL had a long-term purchased power agreement with this facility for substantially all of its capacity and energy. FPL expects to reduce the plant's operations with the intention of phasing the plant out of service. At December 31, 2017, the regulatory asset, net of amortization totaled approximately

$401 million

and is included in current and noncurrent regulatory assets on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets.

If FPL were no longer subject to cost-based rate regulation, the existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or refund. In addition, the FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery of costs



NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred. The continued applicability of regulatory accounting is assessed at each reporting period.

Revenues and Rates

- FPL's retail and wholesale utility rate schedules are approved by the FPSC and the FERC, respectively. FPL records unbilled revenues for the estimated amount of energy delivered to customers but not yet billed. FPL's unbilled revenues are included in customer receivables on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets and amounted to approximately

$423 million

and

$261 million

at

December 31, 2017 and 2016

, respectively. FPL's operating revenues also include amounts resulting from cost recovery clauses (see Rate Regulation above), franchise fees, gross receipts taxes and surcharges related to storms (see Securitized Storm-Recovery Costs, Storm Fund and Storm Reserve below). Franchise fees and gross receipts taxes are imposed on FPL; however, the FPSC allows FPL to include in the amounts charged to customers the amount of the gross receipts tax for all customers and the franchise fee for those customers located in the jurisdiction that imposes the amount. Accordingly, franchise fees and gross receipts taxes are reported gross in operating revenues and taxes other than income taxes and other in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of income and were approximately

$767 million

,

$700 million

and

$722 million

in

2017, 2016 and 2015

, respectively. The revenues from the surcharges related to storms included in operating revenues in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of income were approximately

$393 million

,

$119 million

and

$115 million

in

2017, 2016 and 2015

, respectively. FPL also collects municipal utility taxes which are reported gross in customer receivables and accounts payable on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets.

FPL Rates Effective January 2017 through December 2020 - In December 2016, the FPSC issued a final order approving a stipulation and settlement between FPL and several intervenors in FPL's base rate proceeding (2016 rate agreement). Key elements of the 2016 rate agreement, which is effective from January 2017 through at least December 2020, include, among other things, the following:

•

New retail base rates and charges were established resulting in the following increases in annualized retail base revenues:

◦

$400 million

beginning January 1, 2017;

◦

$211 million

beginning January 1, 2018; and

◦

$200 million

when a new approximately

1,750

MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle unit in Okeechobee County, Florida achieves commercial operation, which is expected to occur in mid-2019.

•

In addition, FPL is eligible to receive, subject to conditions specified in the 2016 rate agreement, base rate increases associated with the addition of up to


MW annually of new solar generation in each of 2017 through 2020 and may carry forward any unused MW to subsequent years during the term of the 2016 rate agreement. Approximately


MW of new solar generating capacity became operational in January 2018. An additional


MW is expected to be operational by March 2018 and in both 2019 and 2020. FPL will be required to demonstrate that any proposed solar facilities are cost effective and scheduled to be in service before December 31, 2021. FPL has agreed to an installed cost cap of

$1,750

per kilowatt (kW).

•

FPL's allowed regulatory return on common equity (ROE) is

10.55%

, with a range of

9.60%

to

11.60%

. If FPL's earned regulatory ROE falls below

9.60%

, FPL may seek retail base rate relief. If the earned regulatory ROE rises above

11.60%

, any party other than FPL may seek a review of FPL's retail base rates.

•

Subject to certain conditions, FPL may amortize, over the term of the 2016 rate agreement, up to

$1.0 billion

of depreciation reserve surplus plus the reserve amount remaining under FPL's 2012 rate agreement discussed below (approximately

$250 million

), provided that in any year of the 2016 rate agreement, FPL must amortize at least enough reserve to maintain a

9.60%

earned regulatory ROE but may not amortize any reserve that would result in an earned regulatory ROE in excess of

11.60%

. See Securitized Storm-Recovery Costs, Storm Fund and Storm Reserve below for discussion of the reserve amortization impact following the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (tax reform).

•

Future storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an interim basis beginning


days from the filing of a cost recovery petition, but capped at an amount that could produce a surcharge of no more than

$4

for every

1,000

kilowatt-hour (kWh) of usage on residential bills during the first


months of cost recovery. Any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years. If storm restoration costs exceed

$800 million

in any given calendar year, FPL may request an increase to the

$4

surcharge to recover amounts above

$400 million

. See Securitized Storm-Recovery Costs, Storm Fund and Storm Reserve below.

In January 2017, the Sierra Club filed a notice of appeal challenging the FPSC’s final order approving the 2016 rate agreement, which notice of appeal is pending before the Florida Supreme Court.

FPL Rates Effective January 2013 through December 2016 - Effective January 2013, pursuant to an FPSC final order approving a stipulation and settlement between FPL and several intervenors in FPL's base rate proceeding (2012 rate agreement), new retail base rates and charges for FPL were established resulting in an increase in retail base revenues of

$350 million

on an annualized basis. The 2012 rate agreement, provided for, among other things, the following:

•

a regulatory ROE of

10.50%

with a range of plus or minus


basis points;

•

an increase in annualized base revenue requirements as each of three FPL modernized power plants became operational in April 2013, April 2014 and April 2016;

•

the continuation of cost recovery through the capacity cost recovery clause (capacity clause) (reported as retail base revenues)



NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

for a generating unit which was placed in service in May 2011 (beginning January 2017, under the 2016 rate agreement, cost recovery is through base rates);

•

subject to certain conditions, the right to reduce depreciation expense up to

$400 million

(reserve), provided that in any year of the 2012 rate agreement, FPL was required to amortize enough reserve to maintain an earned regulatory ROE within the range of

9.50%

to

11.50%

(see Rate Regulation above regarding a subsequent reduction in the reserve amount);

•

an interim cost recovery mechanism for storm restoration costs (see Securitized Storm-Recovery Costs, Storm Fund and Storm Reserve below); and

•

an incentive mechanism whereby customers receive

100%

of certain gains, including but not limited to, gains from the purchase and sale of electricity and natural gas (including transportation and storage), up to a specified threshold; gains exceeding that specified threshold were shared by FPL and its customers.

NEER's revenue is recorded on the basis of commodities delivered, contracts settled or services rendered and includes estimated amounts yet to be billed to customers. Certain commodity contracts for the purchase and sale of power that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized as revenue. See Energy Trading below and Note 3.

Effective January 1, 2018, NEE and FPL adopted an accounting standards update that provides guidance on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers and requires additional disclosures regarding such contracts (new revenue standard). NEE and FPL adopted the new revenue standard using the modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings on January 1, 2018. FPL and NEER generate substantially all of NEE’s operating revenues. FPL’s revenue from contracts with customers is derived primarily from tariff-based sales that result from providing electricity to retail customers in Florida with no defined contractual term. For these types of sales, FPL will recognize revenues under the new revenue standard as electricity is delivered and billed to customers, as well as an estimate for electricity delivered and not yet billed. NEER’s revenue from contracts with customers is derived primarily from the sale of energy commodities, electric capacity and electric transmission. For these types of sales, NEER will recognize revenues under the new revenue standard as energy commodities are delivered and as electric capacity and electric transmission are made available, consistent with the amounts billed to customers. NEER believes for substantially all of its contracts with customers that the obligation to deliver energy, capacity or transmission is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes benefits as NEER performs. Revenue recognition under the new revenue standard for both FPL and NEER is substantially consistent with prior practice and as a result the cumulative effect of adopting the new revenue standard on January 1, 2018 was not material to NEE or FPL.

Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization

- The cost of additions to units of property of FPL and NEER is added to electric plant in service and other property. In accordance with regulatory accounting, the cost of FPL's units of utility property retired, less estimated net salvage value, is charged to accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repairs of property as well as replacements and renewals of items determined to be less than units of utility property are charged to other operations and maintenance (O&M) expenses. At

December 31, 2017

, the electric generation, transmission, distribution and general facilities of FPL represented approximately

49%

,

11%

,

34%

and

6%

, respectively, of FPL's gross investment in electric utility plant in service and other property. Substantially all of FPL's properties are subject to the lien of FPL's mortgage, which secures most debt securities issued by FPL. A number of NEER's generation and pipeline facilities are encumbered by liens securing various financings. The net book value of NEER's assets serving as collateral was approximately

$15.6 billion

at

December 31, 2017

. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, as amended (Recovery Act), provided for an option to elect a cash grant (convertible investment tax credits (ITCs)) for certain renewable energy property (renewable property). Convertible ITCs are recorded as a reduction in property, plant and equipment on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets and are amortized as a reduction to depreciation and amortization expense over the estimated life of the related property. At

December 31, 2017

and


, convertible ITCs, net of amortization, were approximately

$1.9 billion

(

$140 million

at FPL) and

$2.1 billion

(

$147 million

at FPL). At

December 31, 2017

and


, approximately

$138 million

and

$289 million

, respectively, of such convertible ITCs are included primarily in other receivables on NEE's consolidated balance sheets.

Depreciation of FPL's electric property is primarily provided on a straight-line average remaining life basis. FPL includes in depreciation expense a provision for fossil and solar plant dismantlement, interim asset removal costs, accretion related to asset retirement obligations (see Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs below), storm recovery amortization and amortization of pre-construction costs associated with planned nuclear units recovered through a cost recovery clause. For substantially all of FPL's property, depreciation studies are typically performed and filed with the FPSC every

four

years. In accordance with the 2012 rate agreement, FPL was not required to file depreciation studies during the effective period of the agreement; therefore, previously approved depreciation rates which became effective January 1, 2010 remained in effect through December 2016. As part of the 2016 rate agreement, the FPSC approved new depreciation rates which became effective January 1, 2017. As discussed in Revenues and Rates above, the use of reserve amortization is permitted under the 2016 rate agreement and was also permitted under the 2012 rate agreement. In accordance with the 2016 rate agreement and the 2012 rate agreement, FPL recorded reserve amortization (reversal) of approximately

$1,250 million

,

$13 million

and

$(15) million

in

2017, 2016 and 2015

, respectively. Reserve amortization is recorded as a reduction to (or when reversed as an increase to) accrued asset removal costs which is reflected in noncurrent regulatory liabilities on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. In December 2017, following the enactment of tax reform, FPL used available reserve amortization to offset nearly all of the write-off of Hurricane Irma storm restoration costs, and FPL plans to partially restore the reserve amortization through tax savings generated



NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

during the term of the 2016 rate agreement. See Securitized Storm-Recovery Costs, Storm Fund and Storm Reserve below and Note 5. The weighted annual composite depreciation and amortization rate for FPL's electric utility plant in service, including capitalized software, but excluding the effects of decommissioning, dismantlement and the depreciation adjustments discussed above, was approximately

3.7%

,

3.4%

and

3.3%

for

2017, 2016 and 2015

, respectively. FPL files a twelve-month forecast with the FPSC each year which contains a regulatory ROE intended to be earned based on the best information FPL has at that time assuming normal weather. This forecast establishes a fixed targeted regulatory ROE. In order to earn the targeted regulatory ROE in each reporting period under the effective rate agreement, reserve amortization is calculated using a trailing thirteen-month average of retail rate base and capital structure in conjunction with the trailing twelve months regulatory retail base net operating income, which primarily includes the retail base portion of base and other revenues, net of O&M, depreciation and amortization, interest and tax expenses. In general, the net impact of these income statement line items is adjusted, in part, by reserve amortization or its reversal to earn the targeted regulatory ROE.

NEER's electric plant in service less salvage value, if any, are depreciated primarily using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. At

December 31, 2017 and 2016

, wind, solar and nuclear plants represented approximately

61%

and

62%

,

15%

and

14%

and

9%

and

10%

, respectively, of NEER's depreciable electric plant in service and other property. The estimated useful lives of NEER's plants range primarily from


to


years for wind plants,


to


years for solar plants and from


to


years for nuclear plants. NEER reviews the estimated useful lives of its fixed assets on an ongoing basis. In 2017, this review indicated that the actual lives of certain equipment at its wind plants are expected to be longer than those previously estimated for depreciation purposes. As a result, effective January 1, 2017, NEER changed the estimated useful lives of certain wind plant equipment from


years to


years to better reflect the period during which these assets are expected to remain in service. This change increased net income attributable to NEE by approximately $

60 million

and basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to NEE by approximately $

0.12

for the year ended

December 31, 2017

. NEER's oil and gas production assets, representing approximately

9%

and

8%

, respectively, of NEER's depreciable electric plant in service and other property at

December 31, 2017 and 2016

, are accounted for under the successful efforts method. Depletion expenses for the acquisition of reserve rights and development costs are recognized using the unit of production method.

Nuclear Fuel

- FPL and NEER have several contracts for the supply of uranium and the conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel. See Note 13 - Contracts. FPL's and NEER's nuclear fuel costs are charged to fuel expense on a unit of production method.

Construction Activity

- Allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) is a noncash item which represents the allowed cost of capital, including an ROE, used to finance construction projects. The portion of AFUDC attributable to borrowed funds is recorded as a reduction of interest expense and the remainder is recorded as other income. For FPL, FPSC rules limit the recording of AFUDC to projects that have an estimated cost in excess of

0.5%

of a utility's plant in service balance and require more than one year to complete. FPSC rules allow construction projects below the

0.5%

threshold as a component of rate base. During

2017, 2016 and 2015

, FPL capitalized AFUDC at a rate of

6.16%

,

6.34%

and

6.34%

, respectively, which amounted to approximately

$101 million

,

$97 million

and

$88 million

, respectively. See Note 13 - Commitments.

FPL's construction work in progress includes construction materials, progress payments on major equipment contracts, engineering costs, AFUDC and other costs directly associated with the construction of various projects. Upon completion of the projects, these costs are transferred to electric utility plant in service and other property. Capitalized costs associated with construction activities are charged to O&M expenses when recoverability is no longer probable.

NEER capitalizes project development costs once it is probable that such costs will be realized through the ultimate construction of a power plant or sale of development rights. At

December 31, 2017 and 2016

, NEER's capitalized development costs totaled approximately

$433 million

and

$193 million

, respectively, which are included in noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. These costs include land rights and other third-party costs directly associated with the development of a new project. Upon commencement of construction, these costs either are transferred to construction work in progress or remain in other assets, depending upon the nature of the cost. Capitalized development costs are charged to O&M expenses when it is no longer probable that these costs will be realized.

NEER's construction work in progress includes construction materials, progress payments on major equipment contracts, third-party engineering costs, capitalized interest and other costs directly associated with the construction and development of various projects. Interest capitalized on construction projects amounted to approximately

$89 million

,

$107 million

and

$100 million

during

2017, 2016 and 2015

, respectively. Interest expense allocated from NextEra Energy Capital Holdings, Inc. (NEECH) to NEER is based on a deemed capital structure of

70%

debt. Upon commencement of plant operation, costs associated with construction work in progress are transferred to electric plant in service and other property.

Asset Retirement Obligations

- NEE and FPL each account for asset retirement obligations and conditional asset retirement obligations (collectively, AROs) under accounting guidance that requires a liability for the fair value of an ARO to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if it can be reasonably estimated, with the offsetting associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets. The asset retirement cost is subsequently allocated to expense, for NEE's non-rate regulated operations, and regulatory liability, for FPL, using a systematic and rational method over the asset’s estimated



NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

useful life. Changes in the ARO resulting from the passage of time are recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the liability and as accretion expense, which is included in depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of income for NEE's non-rate regulated operations, and ARO and regulatory liability, in the case of FPL. Changes resulting from revisions to the timing or amount of the original estimate of cash flows are recognized as an increase or a decrease in the asset retirement cost, or income when asset retirement cost is depleted, in the case of NEE's non-rate regulated operations, and ARO and regulatory liability, in the case of FPL. See Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs below and Note 12.

Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs

- For ratemaking purposes, FPL accrues for the cost of end of life retirement and disposal of its nuclear, fossil and solar plants over the expected service life of each unit based on nuclear decommissioning and fossil and solar dismantlement studies periodically filed with the FPSC. In addition, FPL accrues for interim removal costs over the life of the related assets based on depreciation studies approved by the FPSC. As approved by the FPSC, FPL previously suspended its annual decommissioning accrual. For financial reporting purposes, FPL recognizes decommissioning and dismantlement liabilities in accordance with accounting guidance that requires a liability for the fair value of an ARO to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred. Any differences between expense recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amount recovered through rates are reported as a regulatory liability in accordance with regulatory accounting. See Revenues and Rates, Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization, Asset Retirement Obligations above and Note 12.

Nuclear decommissioning studies are performed at least every

five

years and are submitted to the FPSC for approval. FPL filed updated nuclear decommissioning studies with the FPSC in December 2015. These studies reflect FPL's current plans, under the operating licenses, for prompt dismantlement of Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 following the end of plant operation with decommissioning activities commencing in 2032 and 2033, respectively, and provide for St. Lucie Unit No. 1 to be mothballed beginning in 2036 with decommissioning activities to be integrated with the prompt dismantlement of St. Lucie Unit No. 2 in 2043. These studies also assume that FPL will be storing spent fuel on site pending removal to a United States (U.S.) government facility. The studies indicate FPL's portion of the ultimate costs of decommissioning its

four

nuclear units, including costs associated with spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under a spent fuel settlement agreement, to be approximately

$7.5 billion

, or

$3.1 billion

expressed in


dollars.

Restricted funds for the payment of future expenditures to decommission FPL's nuclear units are included in nuclear decommissioning reserve funds, which are included in special use funds on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. Marketable securities held in the decommissioning funds are primarily classified as available for sale and carried at fair value. See Note 4. Fund earnings, consisting of dividends, interest and realized gains and losses, net of taxes, are reinvested in the funds. Fund earnings, as well as any changes in unrealized gains and losses, are not recognized in income and are reflected as a corresponding offset in the related regulatory liability accounts. FPL does not currently make contributions to the decommissioning funds, other than the reinvestment of fund earnings. During


,


and


fund earnings on decommissioning funds were approximately

$114 million

,

$102 million

and

$96 million

, respectively. The tax effects of amounts not yet recognized for tax purposes are included in deferred income taxes.

Fossil and solar plant dismantlement studies are typically performed at least every

four

years and are submitted to the FPSC for approval. In accordance with the 2012 rate agreement, FPL was not required to file fossil and solar dismantlement studies during the effective period of the agreement; therefore, previously approved studies which became effective January 1, 2010 remained in effect through December 2016 and resulted in an annual expense of

$18 million

which is recorded in depreciation and amortization expense in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of income. As part of the 2016 rate agreement, the FPSC approved a new annual expense of

$26 million

based on FPL's 2016 fossil and solar dismantlement studies which became effective January 1, 2017. At

December 31, 2017

, FPL's portion of the ultimate cost to dismantle its fossil and solar units is approximately

$1.2 billion

, or

$497 million

expressed in


dollars.

NEER records nuclear decommissioning liabilities for Seabrook Station (Seabrook), Duane Arnold Energy Center (Duane Arnold) and Point Beach Nuclear Power Plant (Point Beach) and dismantlement liabilities for its wind and solar facilities, when required in accordance with accounting guidance that requires a liability for the fair value of an ARO to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred. The liabilities are being accreted using the interest method through the date decommissioning or dismantlement activities are expected to be complete. See Note 12. At

December 31, 2017 and 2016

, NEER's ARO, which is primarily related to nuclear decommissioning and wind and solar dismantlement, was approximately

$984 million

and

$817 million

, respectively, and was primarily determined using various internal and external data and applying a probability percentage to a variety of scenarios regarding the life of the plant and timing of decommissioning or dismantlement. NEER's portion of the ultimate cost of decommissioning its nuclear plants, including costs associated with spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the DOE under a spent fuel settlement agreement, is estimated to be approximately

$10.8 billion

, or

$2.0 billion

expressed in


dollars. The

ultimate cost to dismantle NEER's wind and solar facilities is estimated to be approximately

$1.9 billion

.

Seabrook files a comprehensive nuclear decommissioning study with the New Hampshire Nuclear Decommissioning Financing Committee (NDFC) every

four

years; the most recent study was filed in 2015. Seabrook's decommissioning funding plan is also subject to annual review by the NDFC. Currently, there are no ongoing decommissioning funding requirements for Seabrook, Duane



NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Arnold and Point Beach, however, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and in the case of Seabrook, the NDFC, has the authority to require additional funding in the future. NEER's portion of Seabrook's, Duane Arnold's and Point Beach's restricted funds for the payment of future expenditures to decommission these plants is included in nuclear decommissioning reserve funds, which are included in special use funds on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. Marketable securities held in the decommissioning funds are primarily classified as available for sale and carried at fair value. Market adjustments result in a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income (OCI), except for unrealized losses associated with marketable securities considered to be other than temporary, including any credit losses, which are recognized as other than temporary impairment losses on securities held in nuclear decommissioning funds in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Fund earnings are recognized in income and are reinvested in the funds. See Note 4. The tax effects of amounts not yet recognized for tax purposes are included in deferred income taxes.

Major Maintenance Costs

- FPL expenses costs associated with planned fossil maintenance as incurred. FPL recognizes costs associated with planned major nuclear maintenance in accordance with regulatory treatment. As part of the 2016 rate agreement, the FPSC authorized FPL to change its regulatory accounting treatment of nuclear maintenance costs. Therefore, in 2017, FPL began deferring the actual nuclear maintenance costs for each nuclear unit’s planned outage to a regulatory asset as the costs were incurred and amortizing the costs to O&M expense over the period from the end of the current outage to the end of the next planned outage. The deferred asset for nuclear maintenance costs at December 31, 2017 totaled approximately

$65 million

and is included in noncurrent regulatory assets on NEE’s and FPL’s consolidated balance sheets. Prior to 2017, FPL's estimated nuclear maintenance costs for each nuclear unit's next planned outage were accrued over the period from the end of the last outage to the end of the next planned outage. Any difference between the estimated and actual costs was included in O&M expenses when known. The accrued liability for nuclear maintenance costs at

December 31, 2016

totaled approximately

$65 million

and is included in noncurrent regulatory liabilities on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. For the years ended

December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015

, FPL recognized approximately

$42 million

,

$89 million

and

$90 million

, respectively, in nuclear maintenance costs which are primarily included in O&M expenses in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of income.

NEER uses the deferral method to account for certain planned major maintenance costs. NEER's major maintenance costs for its nuclear generation units and combustion turbines are capitalized and amortized on a unit of production method over the period from the end of the last outage to the beginning of the next planned outage. NEER's capitalized major maintenance costs, net of accumulated amortization, totaled approximately

$79 million

and

$69 million

at

December 31, 2017 and 2016

, respectively, and are included in noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. For the years ended

December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015

, NEER amortized approximately

$68 million

,

$74 million

and

$79 million

in major maintenance costs which are included in O&M expenses in NEE's consolidated statements of income.

Cash Equivalents

- Cash equivalents consist of short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.

Restricted Cash

- In the fourth quarter of 2017, NEE and FPL early adopted an accounting standards update which requires that restricted cash be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the consolidated statements of cash flows. NEE and FPL adopted the standards update retrospectively, which adoption did not have a material impact on NEE’s or FPL’s consolidated statements of cash flows.

At

December 31, 2017 and 2016

, NEE had approximately

$269 million

(

$141 million

for FPL) and

$237 million

($

120 million

for FPL), respectively, of restricted cash, of which approximately

$247 million

(

$128 million

for FPL) and

$228 million

(

$120 million

for FPL), respectively, is included in current other assets and the remaining balance is included in noncurrent other assets on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. Restricted cash is primarily related to debt service payments, bond proceeds held for construction at FPL and margin cash collateral requirements. In addition, where offsetting positions exist, restricted cash related to margin cash collateral is netted against derivative instruments, which totaled

$83 million

at December 31, 2016. See Note 3.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

- FPL maintains an accumulated provision for uncollectible customer accounts receivable that is estimated using a percentage, derived from historical revenue and write-off trends, of the previous four months of revenue. Additional amounts are included in the provision to address specific items that are not considered in the calculation described above. NEER regularly reviews collectibility of its receivables and establishes a provision for losses estimated as a percentage of accounts receivable based on the historical bad debt write-off trends for its retail electricity provider operations and, when necessary, using the specific identification method for all other receivables.

Inventory

- FPL values materials, supplies and fossil fuel inventory using a weighted-average cost method. NEER's materials, supplies and fossil fuel inventories are carried at the lower of weighted-average cost and net realizable value, unless evidence indicates that the weighted-average cost (even if in excess of net realizable value) will be recovered with a normal profit upon sale in the ordinary course of business.

Energy Trading

- NEE provides full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities, which include load-following services and various ancillary services, in certain markets and engages in power and gas marketing and trading activities to optimize the value of electricity and fuel contracts, generation facilities and gas infrastructure assets, as well as to take advantage of projected favorable commodity price movements. Trading contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are accounted for at



NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

fair value and realized gains and losses from all trading contracts, including those where physical delivery is required, are recorded net for all periods presented. See Note 3.

Securitized Storm-Recovery Costs, Storm Fund and Storm Reserve

- In connection with the 2007 storm-recovery bond financing (see Note 8 - FPL), the net proceeds to FPL from the sale of the storm-recovery property were used primarily to reimburse FPL for its estimated net of tax deficiency in its storm and property insurance reserve (storm reserve) and provide for a storm and property insurance reserve fund (storm fund). Upon the issuance of the storm-recovery bonds, the storm reserve deficiency was reclassified to securitized storm-recovery costs which is recorded as a current and noncurrent regulatory asset on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. As storm-recovery charges are billed to customers (which are included in operating revenues), the securitized storm-recovery costs are amortized and included in depreciation and amortization expense in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of income. Marketable securities held in the storm fund are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value. See Note 4. Fund earnings, consisting of dividends, interest and realized gains and losses, net of taxes, are reinvested in the fund. Fund earnings, as well as any changes in unrealized gains and losses, are not recognized in income and are reflected as a corresponding adjustment to the storm reserve. The tax effects of amounts not yet recognized for tax purposes are included in deferred income taxes. During the fourth quarter of 2016, all available funds were withdrawn from the storm fund to pay for the storm restoration costs associated with Hurricane Hermine and Hurricane Matthew (see below regarding Hurricane Hermine and Hurricane Matthew).

FPL was impacted by Hurricane Hermine and Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Irma in 2017. Hurricane Matthew and Hurricane Irma resulted in damage throughout much of FPL's service territory. Damage to FPL property from the hurricanes was primarily limited to the transmission and distribution systems. In March 2017, FPL began recovering from its retail customers, through an interim storm surcharge over a 12-month period, eligible storm restoration costs associated with Hurricane Matthew of approximately

$201 million

(

$294 million

of recoverable costs less

$93 million

available in FPL's storm reserve prior to the storm), plus approximately

$117 million

to replenish the storm reserve to the level authorized in FPL's 2012 rate agreement. The amount collected is subject to refund based on an FPSC prudence review, which hearings are scheduled for May 2018. As the portion of the Hurricane Matthew surcharge applicable to the replenishment of the storm reserve is billed to customers (which is recorded as operating revenues), the storm reserve will be recognized as a regulatory liability and charged to depreciation and amortization expense in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of income. At December 31, 2017, FPL had collected approximately

$74 million

of the storm reserve replenishment (included in noncurrent regulatory liabilities on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets), which provides capacity to absorb future prudently incurred storm restoration costs without seeking cost recovery approval from the FPSC. Accrued storm restoration costs were approximately

$428 million

at December 31, 2017 and are included in current other liabilities on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets.

In December 2017, following the enactment of tax reform, FPL determined that it would not seek recovery of Hurricane Irma storm restoration costs of approximately

$1.3 billion

through a storm surcharge from customers and, as a result, the regulatory asset associated with Hurricane Irma was written off in December 2017 as storm restoration costs in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of income. As allowed under the 2016 rate agreement, FPL used available reserve amortization to offset nearly all of the expense, and plans to partially restore the reserve amortization through tax savings generated during the term of the 2016 rate agreement. In January 2018, the OPC filed a petition with the FPSC to investigate and adjust rates for all Florida investor-owned utilities, including FPL, related to the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate as a result of tax reform.  FPL believes that the benefits of tax reform will be realized by FPL's customers in accordance with the 2016 rate agreement as discussed above. See Note 5.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

-

NEE evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

An impairment loss is required to be recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows associated with that asset. The impairment loss to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds the asset's fair value. In most instances, the fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate interest rate. See Note 4 - Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.



NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

- NEE's goodwill and other intangible assets are as follows:

NEE's goodwill relates to various acquisitions which were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Other intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized, primarily on a straight-line basis, over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense was approximately

$35 million

,

$35 million

and

$17 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015

, respectively, and is expected to be approximately $

36 million

,

$35 million

,

$35 million

,

$35 million

and

$35 million

for 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively.

Goodwill and other intangible assets are primarily included in noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. Goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment at least annually by applying a fair value-based analysis. Other intangible assets subject to amortization are periodically reviewed when impairment indicators are present to assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted future cash flows.

Effective January 1, 2018, NEE and FPL adopted an accounting standards update that clarified the definition of a business. The revised guidance affects the evaluation of whether a transaction should be accounted for as an acquisition or disposition of an asset or a business. NEE and FPL adopted this guidance on a prospective basis effective January 1, 2018.

Pension Plan

- NEE allocates net periodic pension income to its subsidiaries based on the pensionable earnings of the subsidiaries' employees. Accounting guidance requires recognition of the funded status of the pension plan in the balance sheet, with changes in the funded status recognized in other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity in the year in which the changes occur. Since NEE is the plan sponsor, and its subsidiaries do not have separate rights to the plan assets or direct obligations to their employees, this accounting guidance is reflected at NEE and not allocated to the subsidiaries. The portion of previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs or credits that are estimated to be allocable to FPL as net periodic (income) cost in future periods and that otherwise would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) are classified as regulatory assets and liabilities at NEE in accordance with regulatory treatment.

Stock-Based Compensation

- NEE accounts for stock-based payment transactions based on grant-date fair value. Compensation costs for awards with graded vesting are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.  Forfeitures of stock-based awards are recognized as they occur. See Note 10 - Stock-Based Compensation.

Retirement of Long-Term Debt

- Gains and losses that result from differences in FPL's reacquisition cost and the net book value of long-term debt which is retired are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability and amortized to interest expense ratably over the remaining life of the original issue, which is consistent with its treatment in the ratemaking process. NEECH and NEER recognize such differences in interest expense at the time of retirement.

Income Taxes

- Deferred income taxes are recognized on all significant temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and are presented as noncurrent on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. In connection with the tax sharing agreement between NEE and certain of its subsidiaries, the income tax provision at each applicable subsidiary reflects the use of the "separate return method," except that tax benefits that could not be used on a separate return basis, but are used on the consolidated tax return, are recorded by the subsidiary that generated the tax benefits. Any remaining consolidated



NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

income tax benefits or expenses are recorded at the corporate level. Included in other regulatory assets and other regulatory liabilities on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets is the revenue equivalent of the difference in deferred income taxes computed under accounting rules, as compared to regulatory accounting rules. The net regulatory liability totaled $

4,213 million

(

$4,180 million

for FPL) at

December 31, 2017

and the net regulatory asset totaled $

289 million

(

$266 million

for FPL) at

December 31, 2016

, and is being amortized in accordance with the regulatory treatment over the estimated lives of the assets or liabilities for which the deferred tax amount was initially recognized.

Production tax credits (PTCs) are recognized as wind energy is generated and sold based on a per kWh rate prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes and are recorded as a reduction of current income taxes payable, unless limited by tax law in which instance they are recorded as deferred tax assets. NEER recognizes ITCs as a reduction to income tax expense when the related energy property is placed into service. FPL recognizes ITCs as a reduction to income tax expense over the depreciable life of the related energy property. At

December 31, 2017 and 2016

, FPL’s accumulated deferred ITCs were approximately $

119 million

and $

123 million

, respectively, and are included in noncurrent regulatory liabilities on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. NEE and FPL record a deferred income tax benefit created by the convertible ITCs on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of renewable property. For NEER, this deferred income tax benefit is recorded in income tax expense in the year that the renewable property is placed in service. For FPL, this deferred income tax benefit is offset by a regulatory liability, which is amortized as a reduction of depreciation expense over the approximate lives of the related renewable property in accordance with the regulatory treatment. At

December 31, 2017

and


, the net deferred income tax benefits associated with FPL's convertible ITCs were approximately $

44 million

and $

46 million

, respectively, and are included in noncurrent regulatory assets and noncurrent regulatory liabilities on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets.

A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. NEE recognizes interest income (expense) related to unrecognized tax benefits (liabilities) in interest income and interest expense, respectively, net of the amount deferred at FPL. At FPL, the offset to accrued interest receivable (payable) on income taxes is classified as a regulatory liability (regulatory asset) which will be amortized to income (expense) over a five-year period upon settlement in accordance with regulatory treatment. All tax positions taken by NEE in its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more-likely-than-not threshold. NEE and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states, the most significant of which is Florida, and certain foreign jurisdictions. Federal tax liabilities, with the exception of certain refund claims, are effectively settled for all years prior to 2013. State and foreign tax liabilities, which have varied statutes of limitations regarding additional assessments, are generally effectively settled for years prior to 2009. At

December 31, 2017

, NEE had unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $

71 million

that, if disallowed, could impact the annual effective income tax rate. The amounts of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest accruals may change within the next 12 months; however, NEE and FPL do not expect these changes to have a significant impact on NEE’s or FPL’s financial statements. See Note 5.

Sale of Differential Membership Interests

- Certain subsidiaries of NEER sold their Class B membership interest in entities that have ownership interests in wind and solar facilities, with generating capacity totaling approximately

8,197

MW and


MW, respectively, at

December 31, 2017

, to third-party investors. In exchange for the cash received, the holders of the Class B membership interests will receive a portion of the economic attributes of the facilities, including income tax attributes, for variable periods. The proceeds received were deferred and recorded as a liability in deferral related to differential membership interests - VIEs on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. The deferred amount was being recognized in benefits associated with differential membership interests - net in NEE's consolidated statements of income as the Class B members receive their portion of the economic attributes. See Accounting for Partial Sales of Nonfinancial Assets below. NEE continues to operate and manage the wind and solar facilities, and consolidates the entities that own the wind and solar facilities.

Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)

- An entity is considered to be a VIE when its total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or its equity investors, as a group, lack the characteristics of having a controlling financial interest. A reporting company is required to consolidate a VIE as its primary beneficiary when it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. NEE and FPL evaluate whether an entity is a VIE whenever reconsideration events as defined by the accounting guidance occur. See Note 8.

Leases

- In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting standards update which requires, among other things, that lessees recognize a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments, and a right-of-use asset for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases). This standards update also requires new qualitative and quantitative disclosures for both lessees and lessors. This standards update will be effective for NEE and FPL beginning January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted.

NEE and FPL are currently reviewing their portfolio of contracts and evaluating the proper application of the standards update to these contracts in order to determine the impact the adoption will have on their consolidated financial statements. NEE and FPL are implementing a number of system enhancements to facilitate the identification, tracking and reporting of leases based upon the requirements of this standards update. NEE and FPL anticipate adopting this standards update on January 1, 2019.



NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Accounting for Partial Sales of Nonfinancial Assets

- Effective January 1, 2018, NEE and FPL adopted an accounting standards update regarding the accounting for partial sales of nonfinancial assets. This standards update affects the accounting and related financial statement presentation for the sales of differential membership interests to third-party investors and the sales of NEER assets to indirect subsidiaries of NEP and was adopted using the modified retrospective approach, resulting in cumulative effects being recognized on January 1, 2018. For the sales of differential membership interests to third-party investors, NEE recorded an increase to retained earnings of approximately

$50 million

and a reduction to additional paid-in capital of

$70 million

on January 1, 2018. In addition to the cumulative effects, the liability reflected as deferral related to differential membership interests - VIEs on NEE's consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2017 was reclassified to noncontrolling interests on January 1, 2018. In future periods, as tax equity investors receive their portion of the economic attributes, NEE will record a reduction to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Additionally, the profit sharing liability associated with the sales of NEER assets to NEP was eliminated and NEE recorded an increase to additional paid-in capital of approximately

$830 million

and a reduction to retained earnings of approximately

$50 million

on January 1, 2018. The adoption of this standards update did not have an impact on FPL.

Merger Terminations

- From July 2016 through October 2016, NEE and certain of its affiliates entered into several agreements with Energy Future Holdings Corp. (EFH) and Energy Future Intermediate Holding Company LLC (EFIH), Texas Transmission Holdings Corporation (TTHC), Oncor Management Investment LLC and certain of their affiliates, which would have resulted in NEE owning

100%

of Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC (Oncor) if the transactions contemplated by those agreements would have been consummated. The agreements with EFH and EFIH and TTHC were subject to, among other things, approval by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT). In April 2017, the PUCT issued a final order denying NEE's purchase of Oncor. In July 2017, EFH and EFIH provided a written notice to NEE terminating the agreement and plan of merger, dated as of July 29, 2016, as amended (merger agreement), under which EFH Merger Co., LLC, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of NEE, would have acquired

100%

of the equity of reorganized EFH and certain of its subsidiaries, including its indirect ownership of approximately

80%

of the outstanding equity interests of Oncor. Subsequently, NEE, EFH and EFIH and a large creditor of EFIH commenced legal proceedings in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (bankruptcy court) in which the chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings of EFH and EFIH are taking place to determine whether NEE is entitled to receive the

$275 million

termination fee to which NEE believes it is entitled under the merger agreement and a September 2016 order of the bankruptcy court approving the termination fee payment provisions of the merger agreement (2016 termination fee approval order). In October 2017, the judge presiding over these proceedings issued an opinion and order in one of these legal proceedings that the bankruptcy court's issuance of the 2016 termination fee approval order was based upon a fundamental misapprehension of critical facts by the bankruptcy court and, accordingly, ordered that EFH and EFIH are not authorized to pay the fee. NEE has appealed this decision and believes it is erroneous. Until that appeal is ultimately resolved, the remaining legal proceedings in the bankruptcy court between NEE, EFH and EFIH and the large creditor of EFIH as to whether NEE would be entitled to the termination fee if the foregoing appeal is successful have been stayed.

In October 2017, the agreement and plan of merger, dated as of October 30, 2016, pursuant to which a direct wholly owned subsidiary of NEE would have merged with TTHC, was terminated with no material impact to NEE.

In 2014, NEE and Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HEI) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the HEI merger agreement) pursuant to which Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc. (HECO), HEI's wholly owned electric utility subsidiary, was to become a wholly owned subsidiary of NEE. In July 2016, the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission issued an order dismissing NEE's and HECO's merger application and, as a result, NEE terminated the HEI merger agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the HEI merger agreement, NEE paid HEI a termination fee of

$90 million

plus reimbursement to HEI for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the HEI merger agreement of

$5 million

, which is included in merger-related expenses in NEE's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Assets and Liabilities Associated with Assets Held for Sale -

In November 2017, a subsidiary of NEER entered into an agreement to sell its ownership interests in a portfolio of seven wind farms located in California, Pennsylvania and West Virginia with a total generating capacity of


MW at December 31, 2017. The carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities related to the facilities that were classified as held for sale on NEE's consolidated balance sheets at

December 31, 2017

primarily represent property, plant and equipment and the related long-term debt.

In January 2017, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of NEE completed the sale of its membership interests in its fiber-optic telecommunications business for net cash proceeds of approximately

$1.1 billion

, after repayment of

$370 million

of related long-term debt. In connection with the sale and the related consolidating state income tax effects, a gain of approximately

$1.1 billion

(approximately

$685 million

after tax) was recorded in NEE's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2017 and is included in losses (gains) on disposal of a business/assets - net. The carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities related to the fiber-optic telecommunications business that were classified as held for sale on NEE's consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2016 primarily represent property, plant and equipment and the related long-term debt.

In 2016, a subsidiary of NEER completed the sale of its ownership interest in merchant natural gas generation facilities located in Texas with a total generating capacity of

2,884

MW for net cash proceeds of approximately

$456 million

, after transaction costs and working capital adjustments. In connection with the sale and the related consolidating state income tax effects, a gain of approximately

December 31, 2016

and is included in losses (gains) on disposal of a business/assets - net.

In 2016, a subsidiary of NEER completed the sale of its ownership interest in natural gas generation facilities located primarily in Pennsylvania with a total generating capacity of


MW for net cash proceeds of approximately

$260 million

, after transaction costs and working capital adjustments. In connection with the sale and the related consolidating state income tax effects, a gain of approximately

$191 million

December 31, 2016

and is included in losses (gains) on disposal of a business/assets - net.

2. Employee Retirement Benefits

Employee Pension Plan and Other Benefits Plans

- NEE sponsors a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of NEE and its subsidiaries. NEE also has a supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP), which includes a non-qualified supplemental defined benefit pension component that provides benefits to a select group of management and highly compensated employees, and sponsors a contributory postretirement plan for other benefits for retirees of NEE and its subsidiaries meeting certain eligibility requirements. The total accrued benefit cost of the SERP and postretirement plans is approximately

$241 million

(

$208 million

for FPL) and

$325 million

(

$222 million

for FPL) at

December 31, 2017 and 2016

, respectively.

Pension Plan Assets, Benefit Obligations and Funded Status - The changes in assets, benefit obligations and the funded status of the pension plan are as follows:

_________________________

(a)

Reflects an enhanced early retirement program offered in 2017.

(b)

NEE's accumulated pension benefit obligation, which includes no assumption about future salary levels, at

and


was approximately $

2,548 million

and $

2,439 million

, respectively.

(c)

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NEE's unrecognized amounts included in regulatory assets yet to be recognized as components of net prepaid pension benefit costs are as follows:

The following table provides the assumptions used to determine the benefit obligation for the pension plan. These rates are used in determining net periodic income in the following year.

_________________________

(a)

The method of estimating the interest cost component of net periodic benefit costs uses a full yield curve approach by applying a specific spot rate along the yield curve.

NEE's investment policy for the pension plan recognizes the benefit of protecting the plan's funded status, thereby avoiding the necessity of future employer contributions. Its broad objectives are to achieve a high rate of total return with a prudent level of risk taking while maintaining sufficient liquidity and diversification to avoid large losses and preserve capital over the long term.

The NEE pension plan fund's current target asset allocation, which is expected to be reached over time, is

45%

equity investments,

32%

fixed income investments,

13%

alternative investments and

10%

convertible securities. The pension fund's investment strategy emphasizes traditional investments, broadly diversified across the global equity and fixed income markets, using a combination of different investment styles and vehicles. The pension fund's equity and fixed income holdings consist of both directly held securities as well as commingled investment arrangements such as common and collective trusts, pooled separate accounts, registered investment companies and limited partnerships. The pension fund's convertible security assets are principally direct holdings of convertible securities and include a convertible security oriented limited partnership. The pension fund's alternative investments consist primarily of private equity and real estate oriented investments in limited partnerships as well as absolute return oriented limited partnerships that use a broad range of investment strategies on a global basis.

The fair value measurements of NEE's pension plan assets by fair value hierarchy level are as follows:

Regulatory Assets (Liabilities) - The components of net periodic (income) cost recognized during the year in regulatory assets (liabilities) for the pension plan are as follows:

The assumptions used to determine net periodic income for the pension plan are as follows:

______________________

(a)

In developing the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for its pension plan, NEE evaluated input, including other qualitative and quantitative factors, from its actuaries and consultants, as well as information available in the marketplace. NEE considered different models, capital market return assumptions and historical returns for a portfolio with an equity/bond asset mix similar to its pension fund. NEE also considered its pension fund's historical compounded returns.

Employee Contribution Plan

- NEE offers an employee retirement savings plan which allows eligible participants to contribute a percentage of qualified compensation through payroll deductions. NEE makes matching contributions to participants' accounts. Defined contribution expense pursuant to this plan was approximately $

53 million

, $

52 million

and $

63 million

for NEE ($

33 million

, $

32 million

and $

40 million

for FPL) for the years ended

December 31, 2017

,


and


, respectively.

Amendments to Presentation of Retirement Benefits

- Effective January 1, 2018, NEE adopted an accounting standards update that requires certain changes in classification of components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs within the income statement and allows only the service cost component to be eligible for capitalization. NEE adopted the standards update using the retrospective approach for presentation of the components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs and the prospective approach for capitalization of service cost. Upon adoption, NEE, among other things, reclassified the non-service cost components noted in the net periodic (income) cost table above from O&M expense to non-operating income. The adoption of this standards update did not have an impact on net income attributable to NEE and did not have any impact on FPL as NEE is the plan sponsor.

3. Derivative Instruments

NEE and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity, as well as interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated primarily with outstanding and expected future debt issuances and borrowings, and to optimize the value of NEER's power generation and gas infrastructure assets.

With respect to commodities related to NEE's competitive energy business, NEER employs risk management procedures to conduct its activities related to optimizing the value of its power generation and gas infrastructure assets, providing full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities, and engaging in power and gas marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements and changes in the expected volatility of prices in the energy markets. These risk management activities involve the use of derivative instruments executed within prescribed limits to manage the risk associated with fluctuating commodity prices. Transactions in derivative instruments are executed on recognized exchanges or via the over-the-counter (OTC) markets, depending on the most favorable credit terms and market execution factors. For NEER's power generation and gas infrastructure assets, derivative instruments are used to hedge all or a portion of the expected output of these assets. These hedges are designed to reduce the effect of adverse changes in the wholesale forward commodity markets associated



NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

with NEER's power generation and gas infrastructure assets. With regard to full energy and capacity requirements services, NEER is required to vary the quantity of energy and related services based on the load demands of the customers served. For this type of transaction, derivative instruments are used to hedge the anticipated electricity quantities required to serve these customers and reduce the effect of unfavorable changes in the forward energy markets. Additionally, NEER takes positions in energy markets based on differences between actual forward market levels and management's view of fundamental market conditions, including supply/demand imbalances, changes in traditional flows of energy, changes in short- and long-term weather patterns and anticipated regulatory and legislative outcomes. NEER uses derivative instruments to realize value from these market dislocations, subject to strict risk management limits around market, operational and credit exposure.

Derivative instruments, when required to be marked to market, are recorded on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. At FPL, substantially all changes in the derivatives' fair value are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel and purchased power cost recovery clause (fuel clause). For NEE's non-rate regulated operations, predominantly NEER, essentially all changes in the derivatives' fair value for power purchases and sales, fuel sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in operating revenues; fuel purchases used in the production of electricity are recognized in fuel, purchased power and interchange expense; and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Settlement gains and losses are included within the line items in the consolidated statements of income to which they relate. Transactions for which physical delivery is deemed not to have occurred are presented on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income. For commodity derivatives, NEE believes that, where offsetting positions exist at the same location for the same time, the transactions are considered to have been netted and therefore physical delivery has been deemed not to have occurred for financial reporting purposes. Settlements related to derivative instruments are primarily recognized in net cash provided by operating activities in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of cash flows.

In January 2016, NEE discontinued hedge accounting for its cash flow and fair value hedges related to interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments and, therefore, all changes in the derivatives' fair value, as well as the transaction gain or loss on foreign denominated debt, are recognized in interest expense in NEE's consolidated statements of income. In addition, for the years ended

December 31, 2017

and


, NEE reclassified approximately

$2 million

(

$1 million

after tax) and

$18 million

(

$11 million

after tax), respectively, from AOCI to interest expense primarily because it became probable that related future transactions being hedged would not occur. At

December 31, 2017

, NEE's AOCI included amounts related to discontinued interest rate cash flow hedges with expiration dates through

March 2035

and foreign currency cash flow hedges with expiration dates through

September 2030

. Approximately

$25 million

of net losses included in AOCI at

December 31, 2017

is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months as the principal and/or interest payments are made. Such amounts assume no change in scheduled principal payments.

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments

- The tables below present NEE's and FPL's gross derivative positions at

December 31, 2017

and

Notional Volumes of Derivative Instruments

- The following table represents net notional volumes associated with derivative instruments that are required to be reported at fair value in NEE's and FPL's consolidated financial statements. The table includes significant volumes of transactions that have minimal exposure to commodity price changes because they are variably priced agreements. These volumes are only an indication of the commodity exposure that is managed through the use of derivatives. They do not represent net physical asset positions or non-derivative positions and their hedges, nor do they represent NEE's and FPL's net economic exposure, but only the net notional derivative positions that fully or partially hedge the related asset positions. NEE and FPL had derivative commodity contracts for the following net notional volumes:

______________________

(a)

(b)

One million British thermal units

At

December 31, 2017

and


, NEE had interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately

$12.1 billion

and

$15.1 billion

, respectively, and foreign currency contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately

$718 million

and

$705 million

, respectively.

Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features

- Certain derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features including, among other things, the requirement to maintain an investment grade credit rating from specified credit rating agencies and certain financial ratios, as well as credit-related cross-default and material adverse change triggers. At

December 31, 2017

and


, the aggregate fair value of NEE's derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position was approximately

$1.1 billion

(

$3 million

for FPL) and

$1.3 billion

(

$5 million

for FPL), respectively.

If the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these derivative agreements were triggered, certain subsidiaries of NEE, including FPL, could be required to post collateral or settle contracts according to contractual terms which generally allow netting of contracts in offsetting positions. Certain derivative contracts contain multiple types of credit-related triggers. To the extent these contracts contain a credit ratings downgrade trigger, the maximum exposure is included in the following credit ratings collateral posting requirements. If FPL's and NEECH's credit ratings were downgraded to BBB/Baa2 (a two level downgrade for FPL and a one level downgrade for NEECH from the current lowest applicable rating), applicable NEE subsidiaries would be required to post collateral such that the total posted collateral would be approximately

$145 million

(

none

at FPL) and

$110 million

(

none

at FPL) at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively. If FPL's and NEECH's credit ratings were downgraded to below investment grade, applicable NEE subsidiaries would be required to post additional collateral such that the total posted collateral would be approximately

$1.2 billion

(

$45 million

at FPL) and

$990 million

(

$10 million

at FPL) at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively. Some derivative contracts do not contain credit ratings downgrade triggers, but do contain provisions that require certain financial measures be maintained and/or have credit-related cross-default triggers. In the event these provisions were triggered, applicable NEE



NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

subsidiaries could be required to post additional collateral of up to approximately

$210 million

(

$95 million

at FPL) and

$225 million

(

$115 million

at FPL) at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively.

Collateral related to derivatives may be posted in the form of cash or credit support in the normal course of business. At

December 31, 2017

and


, applicable NEE subsidiaries have posted approximately

$2 million

(

none

at FPL) and

$1 million

(

none

at FPL), respectively, in cash and

$20 million

(

none

at FPL) and

$30 million

(

none

at FPL), respectively, in the form of letters of credit each of which could be applied toward the collateral requirements described above. FPL and NEECH have credit facilities generally in excess of the collateral requirements described above that would be available to support, among other things, derivative activities. Under the terms of the credit facilities, maintenance of a specific credit rating is not a condition to drawing on these credit facilities, although there are other conditions to drawing on these credit facilities.

Additionally, some contracts contain certain adequate assurance provisions where a counterparty may demand additional collateral based on subjective events and/or conditions. Due to the subjective nature of these provisions, NEE and FPL are unable to determine an exact value for these items and they are not included in any of the quantitative disclosures above.

4. Fair Value Measurements

The fair value of assets and liabilities are determined using either unadjusted quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) or pricing inputs that are observable (Level 2) whenever that information is available and using unobservable inputs (Level 3) to estimate fair value only when relevant observable inputs are not available. NEE and FPL use several different valuation techniques to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities, relying primarily on the market approach of using prices and other market information for identical and/or comparable assets and liabilities for those assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. NEE's and FPL's assessment of the significance of any particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. Non-performance risk, including the consideration of a credit valuation adjustment, is also considered in the determination of fair value for all assets and liabilities measured at fair value.

Cash Equivalents

and Restricted Cash

- NEE and FPL hold investments in money market funds. The fair value of these funds is estimated using a market approach based on current observable market prices.

Special Use Funds and Other Investments -

NEE and FPL hold primarily debt and equity securities directly, as well as indirectly through commingled funds. Substantially all directly held equity securities are valued at their quoted market prices. For directly held debt securities, multiple prices and price types are obtained from pricing vendors whenever possible, which enables cross-provider validations. A primary price source is identified based on asset type, class or issue of each security. Commingled funds, which are similar to mutual funds, are maintained by banks or investment companies and hold certain investments in accordance with a stated set of objectives. The fair value of commingled funds is primarily derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities. Because the fund shares are offered to a limited group of investors, they are not considered to be traded in an active market.

Derivative Instruments

- NEE and FPL measure the fair value of commodity contracts using a combination of market and income approaches utilizing prices observed on commodities exchanges and in the OTC markets, or through the use of industry-standard valuation techniques, such as option modeling or discounted cash flows techniques, incorporating both observable and unobservable valuation inputs. The resulting measurements are the best estimate of fair value as represented by the transfer of the asset or liability through an orderly transaction in the marketplace at the measurement date.

Most exchange-traded derivative assets and liabilities are valued directly using unadjusted quoted prices. For exchange-traded derivative assets and liabilities where the principal market is deemed to be inactive based on average daily volumes and open interest, the measurement is established using settlement prices from the exchanges, and therefore considered to be valued using other observable inputs.

NEE, through its subsidiaries, including FPL, also enters into OTC commodity contract derivatives. The majority of these contracts are transacted at liquid trading points, and the prices for these contracts are verified using quoted prices in active markets from exchanges, brokers or pricing services for similar contracts.

NEE, through NEER, also enters into full requirements contracts, which, in most cases, meet the definition of derivatives and are measured at fair value. These contracts typically have one or more inputs that are not observable and are significant to the valuation of the contract. In addition, certain exchange and non-exchange traded derivative options at NEE have one or more significant inputs that are not observable, and are valued using industry-standard option models.

In all cases where NEE and FPL use significant unobservable inputs for the valuation of a commodity contract, consideration is given to the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. The primary input to the valuation models for commodity contracts is the forward commodity curve for the respective instruments. Other inputs include, but are not limited to, assumptions about market liquidity, volatility, correlation and contract duration as more fully described below in Significant Unobservable Inputs Used in Recurring Fair Value Measurements. In instances where the reference markets are deemed to be inactive or do not have transactions for a similar contract, the derivative assets and liabilities may be valued using significant other observable inputs and potentially significant unobservable inputs. In such instances, the valuation for these contracts is established



NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

using techniques including extrapolation from or interpolation between actively traded contracts, or estimated basis adjustments from liquid trading points. NEE and FPL regularly evaluate and validate the inputs used to determine fair value by a number of methods, consisting of various market price verification procedures, including the use of pricing services and multiple broker quotes to support the market price of the various commodities. In all cases where there are assumptions and models used to generate inputs for valuing derivative assets and liabilities, the review and verification of the assumptions, models and changes to the models are undertaken by individuals that are independent of those responsible for estimating fair value.

NEE uses interest rate contracts and foreign currency contracts to mitigate and adjust interest rate and foreign currency exchange exposure related primarily to certain outstanding and expected future debt issuances and borrowings when deemed appropriate based on market conditions or when required by financing agreements. NEE estimates the fair value of these derivatives using an income approach based on a discounted cash flows valuation technique utilizing the net amount of estimated future cash inflows and outflows related to the agreements.

Recurring Fair Value Measurements

- NEE's and FPL's financial assets and liabilities and other fair value measurements made on a recurring basis by fair value hierarchy level are as follows:

______________________

(a)

Includes the effect of the contractual ability to settle contracts under master netting arrangements and the netting of margin cash collateral payments and receipts. NEE and FPL also have contract settlement receivable and payable balances that are subject to the master netting arrangements but are not offset within the consolidated balance sheets and are recorded in customer receivables - net and accounts payable, respectively.

(b)

Includes restricted cash of approximately

$159 million

(

$128 million

for FPL) in current other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

(c)

Excludes investments accounted for under the equity method and loans not measured at fair value on a recurring basis. See Fair Value of Financial Instruments Recorded at Other than Fair Value below.

(d)

Primarily invested in commingled funds whose underlying securities would be Level 1 if those securities were held directly by NEE or FPL.

Significant Unobservable Inputs Used in Recurring Fair Value Measurements

- The valuation of certain commodity contracts requires the use of significant unobservable inputs. All forward price, implied volatility, implied correlation and interest rate inputs used in the valuation of such contracts are directly based on third-party market data, such as broker quotes and exchange settlements, when that data is available. If third-party market data is not available, then industry standard methodologies are used to develop inputs that maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Observable inputs, including some forward prices, implied volatilities and interest rates used for determining fair value are updated daily to reflect the best available market information. Unobservable inputs which are related to observable inputs, such as illiquid portions of forward price or volatility curves, are updated daily as well, using industry standard techniques such as interpolation and extrapolation, combining observable forward inputs supplemented by historical market and other relevant data. Other unobservable inputs, such as implied correlations, customer migration rates from full requirements contracts and some implied volatility curves, are modeled using proprietary models based on historical data and industry standard techniques.

All price, volatility, correlation and customer migration inputs used in valuation are subject to validation by the Trading Risk Management group. The Trading Risk Management group performs a risk management function responsible for assessing credit, market and operational risk impact, reviewing valuation methodology and modeling, confirming transactions, monitoring approval processes and developing and monitoring trading limits. The Trading Risk Management group is separate from the transacting



NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

group. For markets where independent third-party data is readily available, validation is conducted daily by directly reviewing this market data against inputs utilized by the transacting group, and indirectly by reviewing daily risk reports. For markets where independent third-party data is not readily available, additional analytical reviews are performed on at least a quarterly basis. These analytical reviews are designed to ensure that all price and volatility curves used for fair valuing transactions are adequately validated each quarter, and are reviewed and approved by the Trading Risk Management group. In addition, other valuation assumptions such as implied correlations and customer migration rates are reviewed and approved by the Trading Risk Management group on a periodic basis. Newly created models used in the valuation process are also subject to testing and approval by the Trading Risk Management group prior to use and established models are reviewed annually, or more often as needed, by the Trading Risk Management group.

On a monthly basis, the Exposure Management Committee (EMC), which is comprised of certain members of senior management, meets with representatives from the Trading Risk Management group and the transacting group to discuss NEE's and FPL's energy risk profile and operations, to review risk reports and to discuss fair value issues as necessary. The EMC develops guidelines required for an appropriate risk management control infrastructure, which includes implementation and monitoring of compliance with Trading Risk Management policy. The EMC executes its risk management responsibilities through direct oversight and delegation of its responsibilities to the Trading Risk Management group, as well as to other corporate and business unit personnel.

The significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of NEE's commodity contracts categorized as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy at

December 31, 2017

are as follows:

In addition, the fair value measurement of interest rate contract net liabilities related to the solar projects in Spain of approximately

$132 million

at

December 31, 2017

includes a significant credit valuation adjustment. The credit valuation adjustment, considered an unobservable input, reflects management's assessment of non-performance risk of the subsidiaries related to the solar projects in Spain that are party to the contracts.

Contingent Consideration

- NEE recorded a liability related to a contingent holdback as part of the 2015 acquisition of a portfolio of seven long-term contracted natural gas pipeline assets located in Texas (Texas pipelines). See Note 7 - Texas Pipeline Business.

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements

- NEE tests long-lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. A wholly owned subsidiary of NEER has a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Duane Arnold's primary customer for the energy and capacity related to NEER's

70%

ownership share of Duane Arnold that expires on December 31, 2025. NEER had previously expected Duane Arnold would operate at least until the end of its NRC operating license in February 2034. In early December 2017, NEER concluded that it is unlikely that Duane Arnold's primary customer will extend the current PPA after it expires in 2025. Without the long-term cash flow certainty of a PPA for Duane Arnold's energy and capacity, NEER would likely close Duane Arnold on or about December 31, 2025, the end of its current PPA term. As a result of the change in Duane Arnold's useful life, NEER updated depreciation and ARO estimates to reflect the December 31, 2025 closure. A recoverability analysis performed by NEER determined that the undiscounted cash flows of Duane Arnold were less than its carrying amount and, accordingly, NEER performed a fair value analysis to determine the amount of the impairment. Based on the fair value analysis, long-lived assets (primarily property, plant and equipment) with a carrying amount of approximately $

502 million

were written down to their fair value of $

82 million

, resulting in an impairment of $

420 million

($

258 million

after tax), which is included in impairment charges in NEE's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2017. The estimate of fair value was based on a combination of the income and market value approaches. The income approach utilized a discounted cash flow valuation technique considering contracted revenue rates (Level 2), annual generation forecasts, annual projected capital and maintenance expenditures and a discount rate (all of which are Level 3). The market value approach utilized a transaction involving a comparable nuclear power plant sale in March 2017 and adjusted for certain entity specific assumptions (Level 3).

Primarily represents investments accounted for under the equity method and loans not measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

(b)

Primarily a note receivable which bears interest at a fixed rate and matures in 2029. At December 31, 2017, the note receivable is classified as held for sale and is under contract, along with debt secured by this note receivable (see Note 8

NEER). Fair values are estimated using an income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow valuation technique based on certain observable yield curves and indices considering the credit profile of the borrower (Level 3).

(c)

At

December 31, 2017 and 2016

, for NEE, approximately

$33,743 million

For FPL, primarily estimated using quoted market prices for the same or similar issues (Level 2).

(d)

Excludes debt totaling approximately

$373 million

reflected in liabilities associated with assets held for sale on NEE's consolidated balance sheets for which the carrying amount approximates fair value. See Note 1 - Assets and Liabilities Associated with Assets Held for Sale.

Special Use Funds

- The special use funds noted above and those carried at fair value (see Recurring Fair Value Measurements above) consist of NEE's nuclear decommissioning fund assets of approximately

$6,003 million

and

$5,434 million

at

December 31, 2017 and 2016

, respectively, (

$4,090 million

and

$3,665 million

, respectively, for FPL). The investments held in the special use funds consist of equity and debt securities which are primarily classified as available for sale and carried at estimated fair value. The amortized cost of debt and equity securities is approximately $

1,921 million

and $

1,521 million

and $

1,373 million

and $

, respectively, at

December 31, 2016

for FPL). For FPL's special use funds, consistent with regulatory treatment, changes in fair value, including any other than temporary impairment losses, result in a corresponding adjustment to the related regulatory asset or liability accounts. For NEE's non-rate regulated operations, changes in fair value result in a corresponding adjustment to OCI, except for unrealized losses associated with marketable securities considered to be other than temporary, including any credit losses, which are recognized as other than temporary impairment losses on securities held in nuclear decommissioning funds in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Debt securities included in the nuclear decommissioning funds have a weighted-average maturity at

December 31, 2017

of approximately

eight

years at both NEE and FPL. The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.

Realized gains and losses and proceeds from the sale or maturity of available for sale securities are as follows:

The unrealized gains on available for sale securities are as follows:

Regulations issued by the FERC and the NRC provide general risk management guidelines to protect nuclear decommissioning funds and to allow such funds to earn a reasonable return. The FERC regulations prohibit, among other investments, investments in any securities of NEE or its subsidiaries, affiliates or associates, excluding investments tied to market indices or mutual funds. Similar restrictions applicable to the decommissioning funds for NEER's nuclear plants are included in the NRC operating licenses for those facilities or in NRC regulations applicable to NRC licensees not in cost-of-service environments. With respect to the decommissioning fund for Seabrook, decommissioning fund contributions and withdrawals are also regulated by the NDFC pursuant to New Hampshire law.

The nuclear decommissioning reserve funds are managed by investment managers who must comply with the guidelines of NEE and FPL and the rules of the applicable regulatory authorities. The funds' assets are invested giving consideration to taxes, liquidity, risk, diversification and other prudent investment objectives.

Financial Instruments Accounting Standards Update

- Effective January 1, 2018, NEE and FPL adopted an accounting standards update which modifies guidance for financial instruments and makes certain changes to presentation and disclosure requirements. The standards update requires that equity investments (except investments accounted for under the equity method and investments that are consolidated) be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. This standards update primarily impacts the equity securities in NEER's special use funds and is expected to result in increased earnings volatility in future periods based on market conditions. NEE and FPL adopted this standards update using the modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings on January 1, 2018. Upon adoption, NEE reclassified net unrealized after-tax gains of approximately

$315 million

from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to retained earnings. The implementation of this standards update had no impact on FPL as changes in the fair value of equity securities in FPL's special use funds are deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities pursuant to accounting guidance for regulated operations.

5. Income Taxes

On December 22, 2017, tax reform legislation was signed into law which, among other things, reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. As a result, NEE, including FPL, performed an analysis to preliminarily revalue its deferred income taxes and included an estimate of changes in the balances in NEE's and FPL's December 31, 2017 financial statements. At December 31, 2017, the revaluation reduced NEE’s net deferred income tax liabilities by approximately

$6.5 billion

, of which

$4.5 billion

related to net deferred income tax liabilities at FPL and the remaining

$2 billion

related to net deferred income tax liabilities at NEER. The

$2 billion

reduction in NEER’s deferred income tax liabilities increased NEER’s 2017 net income. The

$4.5 billion

reduction in FPL’s deferred income tax liabilities was recorded as a regulatory liability. While NEE and FPL believe that the provisional tax reform adjustments are reasonable estimates of the effects on its existing deferred taxes, additional analysis and detailed reviews are still being performed to finalize the accounting for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the enactment of tax reform.

6. Jointly-Owned Electric Plants

Certain NEE subsidiaries own undivided interests in the jointly-owned facilities described below, and are entitled to a proportionate share of the output from those facilities. The subsidiaries are responsible for their share of the operating costs, as well as providing their own financing. Accordingly, each subsidiary's proportionate share of the facilities and related revenues and expenses is included in the appropriate balance sheet and statement of income captions. NEE's and FPL's respective shares of direct expenses for these facilities are included in fuel, purchased power and interchange expense, O&M expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes and other - net in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of income.

NEE's and FPL's proportionate ownership interest in jointly-owned facilities is as follows:

7. Business Acquisition

Texas Pipeline Business -

On October 1, 2015, a subsidiary of NEP acquired

100%

of the membership interests in NET Holdings Management, LLC (Texas pipeline business), a developer, owner and operator of the Texas pipelines. One of the acquired pipelines is subject to a

10%

noncontrolling interest. The aggregate purchase price of approximately

$2 billion

included approximately

$934 million

in cash consideration and the assumption of approximately

$706 million

in existing debt of the Texas pipeline business and its subsidiaries at closing and excluded post-closing working capital adjustments of approximately

$2 million

. The purchase price was subject to (i) a

$200 million

holdback payable, in whole or in part, upon satisfaction of financial performance and capital expenditure thresholds relating to planned expansion projects (contingent holdback) and (ii) a

$200 million

holdback retained to satisfy any indemnification obligations of the sellers through April 2017. NEP incurred approximately

$13 million

in acquisition-related costs during the year ended December 31, 2015, which are reflected in O&M expenses in NEE's consolidated statements of income.

Under the acquisition method, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on October 1, 2015 based on their estimated fair value. All fair value measurements of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including the noncontrolling interest, were based on significant estimates and assumptions, including Level 3 inputs, which require judgment. Estimates and assumptions include the projected timing and amount of future cash flows, discount rates reflecting risk inherent in future cash flows and future market prices. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recognized as goodwill at the acquisition date. The goodwill arising from the acquisition consists largely of growth opportunities from the Texas pipeline business. Approximately

$380 million

of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes over a


year period. The contingent holdback discussed above was payable if the Texas pipelines entered into one or more written contracts by

December 31, 2016

related to financial performance and capital expenditure thresholds discussed above. A liability of approximately

$186 million

was recognized as of the acquisition date for each of the contingent holdback and the indemnity holdback, reflecting the fair value of the expected future payments. NEE determined this fair value measurement based on management's probability assessment. The significant inputs and assumptions used in the fair value measurement included the estimated probability of executing contracts related to financial performance and capital expenditure thresholds as well as the appropriate discount rate. In 2016, NEE recorded fair value adjustments to eliminate the entire contingent holdback as the contracts contemplated in the acquisition were not executed by

December 31, 2016

. The fair value adjustments are reflected as revaluation of contingent consideration in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Subsequent to the acquisition, the present value of the indemnity holdback increased to approximately $

199 million

at

December 31, 2016

and was included in



NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

current other liabilities on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. During 2017, the indemnity holdback was released under the terms of the Texas pipelines acquisition agreement and approximately

$200 million

was paid to the sellers.

8. Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)

At

December 31, 2017

, NEE had

thirty-seven

VIEs which it consolidated and had interests in certain other VIEs which it did not consolidate.

FPL

- FPL is considered the primary beneficiary of, and therefore consolidates, a VIE that is a wholly owned bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that it formed in 2007 for the sole purpose of issuing storm-recovery bonds pursuant to the securitization provisions of the Florida Statutes and a financing order of the FPSC. FPL is considered the primary beneficiary because FPL has the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE, and its equity investment, which is subordinate to the bondholder's interest in the VIE, is at risk. Storm restoration costs incurred by FPL during 2005 and 2004 exceeded the amount in FPL's funded storm and property insurance reserve, resulting in a storm reserve deficiency. In 2007, the VIE issued $

652 million

aggregate principal amount of senior secured bonds (storm-recovery bonds), primarily for the after-tax equivalent of the total of FPL's unrecovered balance of the 2004 storm restoration costs, the 2005 storm restoration costs and to reestablish FPL's storm and property insurance reserve. In connection with this financing, net proceeds, after debt issuance costs, to the VIE (approximately $

644 million

) were used to acquire the storm-recovery property, which includes the right to impose, collect and receive a storm-recovery charge from all customers receiving electric transmission or distribution service from FPL under rate schedules approved by the FPSC or under special contracts, certain other rights and interests that arise under the financing order issued by the FPSC and certain other collateral pledged by the VIE that issued the bonds. The storm-recovery bonds are payable only from and are secured by the storm-recovery property. The bondholders have no recourse to the general credit of FPL. The assets of the VIE were approximately $

148 million

and $

216 million

at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively, and consisted primarily of storm-recovery property, which are included in both current and noncurrent regulatory assets on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. The liabilities of the VIE were approximately $

147 million

and $

214 million

at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively, and consisted primarily of storm-recovery bonds, which are included in current maturities of long-term debt and long-term debt on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets.

NEER

- NEE consolidates

thirty-six

NEER VIEs. NEER is considered the primary beneficiary of these VIEs since NEER controls the most significant activities of these VIEs, including operations and maintenance, and has the obligation to absorb expected losses of these VIEs.

A

subsidiary of NEER is the primary beneficiary of, and therefore consolidates, NEP, which consolidates NEP OpCo because of NEP’s controlling interest in the general partner of NEP OpCo. NEP is a limited partnership formed to acquire, manage and own contracted clean energy projects with stable, long-term cash flows through a limited partner interest in NEP OpCo. At December 31, 2017, NEE owned a controlling non-economic general partner interest in NEP and a limited partner interest in NEP OpCo, and presented limited partner interests in NEP as a noncontrolling interest in NEE's consolidated financial statements. At

December 31, 2017

, NEE owned common units of NEP OpCo representing noncontrolling interest in NEP’s operating projects of approximately

65.1%

. The assets and liabilities of NEP were approximately $

8.4 billion

and $

6.2 billion

, respectively, at

December 31, 2017

, and $

7.2 billion

and $

5.0 billion

, respectively, at

December 31, 2016

, and primarily consisted of property, plant and equipment and long-term debt. During the third quarter of 2017, changes to NEP's governance structure were made that, among other things, enhanced NEP unitholder governance rights. As a result of these governance changes, NEP was deconsolidated from NEE in January 2018.

A

NEER VIE consolidates two entities which own and operate natural gas/oil electric generation facilities with the capability of producing


MW. These entities sell their electric output under power sales contracts to a third party, with expiration dates in


and


. The power sales contracts provide the offtaker the ability to dispatch the facilities and require the offtaker to absorb the cost of fuel. The entities have third-party debt which is secured by liens against the generation facilities and the other assets of these entities. The debt holders have no recourse to the general credit of NEER for the repayment of debt. The assets and liabilities of the VIE were approximately $

89 million

and $

29 million

, respectively, at

December 31, 2017

and $

95 million

and $

42 million

, respectively, at

December 31, 2016

, and consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment and long-term debt.

Two

indirect subsidiaries of NEER each contributed, to a NEP subsidiary, an approximately


% ownership interest in three entities which own and operate solar photovoltaic (PV) facilities with the capability of producing a total of approximately


MW. Each of the two indirect subsidiaries of NEER is considered a VIE since the non-managing members have no substantive rights over the managing members, and is consolidated by NEER. These three entities sell their electric output to third parties under power sales contracts with expiration dates in


and


. The three entities have third-party debt which is secured by liens against the assets of the entities. The debt holders have no recourse to the general credit of NEER for the repayment of debt. The assets and liabilities of these VIEs were approximately $

548 million

and $

594 million

, respectively, at

December 31, 2017

and $

571 million

and $

487 million

, respectively, at

December 31, 2016

, and consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment and long-term debt.

NEER consolidates a special purpose entity that has insufficient equity at risk and is considered a VIE. The entity provided a loan in the form of a note receivable (see Note 4 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments Recorded at Other than Fair Value) to an unrelated third party, and also issued senior secured bonds which are collateralized by the note receivable. The assets and liabilities of the



NEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

VIE were approximately

$490 million

and

$502 million

, respectively, at

December 31, 2017

, and $

502 million

and $

511 million

, respectively at

December 31, 2016

, and consisted primarily of notes receivables (included in other investments and classified as held for sale at

December 31, 2017

) and long-term debt.

The other

thirty-one

NEER VIEs that are consolidated relate to certain subsidiaries which have sold differential membership interests in entities which own and operate wind electric generation and solar

PV

facilities with the capability of producing a total of approximately

8,197

MW and


MW, respectively. These entities sell their electric output either under power sales contracts to third parties with expiration dates ranging from


through


or in the spot market. Certain investors that have no equity at risk in the VIEs hold differential membership interests, which give them the right to receive a portion of the economic attributes of the generation facilities, including certain tax attributes. Certain entities have third-party debt which is secured by liens against the generation facilities and the other assets of these entities or by pledges of NEER's ownership interest in these entities. The debt holders have no recourse to the general credit of NEER for the repayment of debt. The assets and liabilities of these VIEs totaled approximately $

13.1 billion

and $

6.9 billion

, respectively, at

December 31, 2017

.

Twenty-seven

of the

thirty-one

were VIEs at

December 31, 2016

and were consolidated; the assets and liabilities of those VIEs totaled approximately $

10.9 billion

and $

6.9 billion

, respectively, at

December 31, 2016

. At

December 31, 2017

and


, the assets and liabilities of the VIEs consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment, deferral related to differential membership interests and long-term debt.

Other

- At

December 31, 2017

and


, several NEE subsidiaries have investments totaling approximately $

2,634 million

($

2,195 million

at FPL) and $

2,505 million

($

2,049 million

at FPL), respectively, which are included in special use funds and other investments on NEE's consolidated balance sheets and in special use funds on FPL's consolidated balance sheets. These investments represented primarily commingled funds and mortgage-backed securities. NEE subsidiaries, including FPL, are not the primary beneficiary and therefore do not consolidate any of these entities because they do not control any of the ongoing activities of these entities, were not involved in the initial design of these entities and do not have a controlling financial interest in these entities.

Certain subsidiaries of NEE have noncontrolling interests in entities accounted for under the equity method. These entities are limited partnerships or similar entity structures in which the limited partners or nonmanaging members do not have substantive rights, and therefore are considered VIEs. NEE is not the primary beneficiary because it does not have a controlling financial interest in these entities, and therefore does not consolidate any of these entities. NEE’s investment in these entities totaled approximately $

248 million

and $

234 million

at

December 31, 2017 and 2016

, respectively, which are included in other investments on NEE’s consolidated balance sheets. Subsidiaries of NEE had committed to invest an additional approximately $

75 million

in

three

of the entities at

December 31, 2017

and $

30 million

in

two

of the entities at

December 31, 2016

.

9. Investments in Partnerships and Joint Ventures

Certain subsidiaries of NEE, primarily NEER, have noncontrolling non-majority owned interests in various partnerships and joint ventures, essentially all of which own or are in the process of developing natural gas pipelines or own electric generation facilities. At

December 31, 2017

and


, NEE's investments in partnerships and joint ventures totaled approximately

$2,321 million

and

$1,767 million

, respectively, which are included in other investments on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. NEER's interest in these partnerships and joint ventures primarily range from approximately

31%

to

50%

. At

December 31, 2017 and 2016

, the principal entities included in NEER's investments in partnerships and joint ventures were Sabal Trail Transmission, LLC (Sabal Trail), Desert Sunlight Investment Holdings, LLC, Northeast Energy, LP and Cedar Point II Wind, LP, and in 2017 also included Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC.

Summarized combined information for these principal entities is as follows:

Calculated using the treasury stock method. Performance share awards are included in diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding based upon what would be issued if the end of the reporting period was the end of the term of the award.

Common shares issuable pursuant to equity units, stock options, performance share awards and forward sale agreements, as well as restricted stock which were not included in the denominator above due to their antidilutive effect were approximately

3.1 million

,

7.9 million

and

3.5 million

for the years ended December 31,


,


and


, respectively. NEP's senior unsecured convertible notes (see Note 11) and NEP Series A Preferred Units (see below) are potentially dilutive securities; however, their effect on the calculation of NEE's diluted EPS for the year ended

December 31, 2017

was not material.

Forward Sale Agreements

- In November 2016, NEE entered into forward sale agreements with several forward counterparties for

12 million

shares of its common stock to be settled on a date or dates to be specified at NEE’s direction, no later than November 1, 2017. During 2017, NEE issued

1,711,345

shares of its common stock to net share settle the forward sale agreements. The forward sale price used to determine the net share settlement amount was calculated based on the initial forward sale price of

$124.00

per share, less certain adjustments as specified in the forward sale agreements.

Common Stock Dividend Restrictions

- NEE's charter does not limit the dividends that may be paid on its common stock. FPL's mortgage securing FPL's first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends and other distributions to NEE. These restrictions do not currently limit FPL's ability to pay dividends to NEE.

Stock-Based Compensation

- Net income for the years ended December 31,


,


and


includes approximately $

76 million

, $

77 million

and $

60 million

, respectively, of compensation costs and $

29 million

, $

30 million

and $

23 million

, respectively, of income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements. Compensation cost capitalized for the years ended December 31,


,


and


was not material. At December 31,


, there were approximately $

85 million

of unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested/nonexercisable stock-based compensation arrangements. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

1.8

years.

At December 31,


, approximately

16 million

shares of common stock were authorized for awards to officers, employees and non-employee directors of NEE and its subsidiaries under NEE's: (a) Amended and Restated 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan, (b) 2017 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan and (c) earlier equity compensation plans under which shares are reserved for issuance under existing grants, but no additional shares are available for grant under the earlier plans. NEE satisfies restricted stock and performance share awards by issuing new shares of its common stock or by purchasing shares of its common stock in the open market. NEE satisfies stock option exercises by issuing new shares of its common stock. NEE generally grants most of its stock-based compensation awards in the first quarter of each year.

Restricted Stock and Performance Share Awards

- Restricted stock typically vests within

three

years after the date of grant and is subject to, among other things, restrictions on transferability prior to vesting. The fair value of restricted stock is measured based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant. Performance share awards are typically payable at the end of a

three

-year performance period if the specified performance criteria are met. The fair value of performance share awards is estimated primarily based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant less the present value of expected dividends, multiplied by an estimated performance multiple which is subsequently trued up based on actual performance.

Options - Options typically vest within

three

years after the date of grant and have a maximum term of

ten

years. The exercise price of each option granted equals the closing market price of NEE common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of the options is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and based on the following assumptions:

$550 million

of Series A convertible preferred units representing limited partner interests in NEP (NEP preferred units), which are reflected in noncontrolling interests on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. Holders of the NEP preferred units are entitled to receive certain cumulative quarterly distributions from NEP, which will be paid, at NEP’s election and subject to certain limitations, in cash, additional NEP preferred units or a combination thereof. Each holder of NEP preferred units (together with its affiliates) may elect to convert all or any portion of its NEP preferred units into common units of NEP initially on a one-for-one basis, subject to certain adjustments (the conversion rate), at any time after June 20, 2019, subject to certain conditions. NEP may elect to convert all or a portion of the NEP preferred units into NEP common units based on the conversion rate at any time after November 15, 2018 if certain conditions are met and subject to certain maximum conversion amounts prior to November 2020.

11. Debt

Long-term debt consists of the following:

______________________

(a)

Principal on the storm-recovery bonds is due on the final maturity date (the date by which the principal must be repaid to prevent a default) for each tranche, however, it is being paid semiannually and sequentially.

(b)

Includes approximately

$838 million

of variable rate tax exempt bonds that permit individual bond holders to tender the bonds for purchase at any time prior to maturity. In the event these variable rate tax exempt bonds are tendered for purchase, they would be remarketed by a designated remarketing agent in accordance with the related indenture. If the remarketing is unsuccessful, FPL would be required to purchase the variable rate tax exempt bonds. At

December 31, 2017

, all variable rate tax exempt bonds tendered for purchase have been successfully remarketed. FPL's bank revolving line of credit facilities are available to support the purchase of the variable rate tax exempt bonds. Variable interest rate is established at various intervals by the remarketing agent.

(c)

Variable rate is based on an underlying index plus a margin.

(d)

Interest rate contracts, primarily swaps, have been entered into with respect to certain of these debt issuances. Additionally, foreign currency contracts have been entered into with respect to the Japanese yen denominated debt. See Note 3.

(e)

Excludes debt totaling

$373 million

reflected in liabilities associated with assets held for sale on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. See Note 1 - Assets and Liabilities Associated with Assets Held for Sale.

(f)

Includes approximately

$483 million

$9.8 billion

(

$3.1 billion

for FPL) relate to revolving line of credit facilities and

$0.08 billion

(

none

for FPL) relate to letter of credit facilities. Certain of the revolving line of credit facilities provide for the issuance of letters of credit of up to approximately

$3.0 billion

(

$0.7 billion

for FPL). The issuance of letters of credit under certain revolving line of credit facilities is subject to the aggregate commitment of the relevant banks to issue letters of credit under the applicable facility.

NEE has guaranteed certain payment obligations of NEECH, including most of those under NEECH's debt, including all of its debentures and commercial paper issuances, as well as most of its payment guarantees and indemnifications. NEECH has guaranteed certain debt and other obligations of NEER and its subsidiaries.

In September 2015, NEE sold

$700 million

of equity units (initially consisting of Corporate Units). Each equity unit has a stated amount of

$50

and consists of a contract to purchase NEE common stock (stock purchase contract) and, initially, a

5%

undivided beneficial ownership interest in a Series H Debenture due September 1, 2020 issued in the principal amount of

$1,000

by NEECH. Each stock purchase contract requires the holder to purchase by no later than September 1, 2018 (the final settlement date) for a price of

$50

in cash, a number of shares of NEE common stock (subject to antidilution adjustments) based on a price per share range of

$95.35

0.5293

shares if the applicable market value of a share of common stock is less than or equal to

$95.35

to

0.4412

shares if the applicable market value of a share is equal to or greater than

$114.42

, with applicable market value to be determined using the average closing prices of NEE common stock over a


-day trading period ending August 29, 2018. Total annual distributions on the equity units are at the rate of

6.371%

, consisting of interest on the debentures (

2.36%

per year) and payments under the stock purchase contracts (

4.011%

per year). The interest rate on the debentures is expected to be reset on or after March 1, 2018. A holder of an equity unit may satisfy its purchase obligation with proceeds raised from remarketing the NEECH debentures that are part of its equity unit. The undivided beneficial ownership interest in the NEECH debenture that is a component of each Corporate Unit is pledged to NEE to secure the holder's obligation to purchase NEE common stock under the related stock purchase contract. If a successful remarketing does not occur on or before the third business day prior to the final settlement date, and a holder has not notified NEE of its intention to settle the stock purchase contract with cash, the debentures that are components of the Corporate Units will be used to satisfy in full the holders' obligations to purchase NEE common stock under the related stock purchase contracts on the final settlement date. The debentures are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NEE.

In August 2016, NEE sold

$1.5 billion

of equity units (initially consisting of Corporate Units). Each equity unit has a stated amount of

$50

and consists of a contract to purchase NEE common stock (stock purchase contract) and, initially, a

5%

undivided beneficial ownership interest in a Series I Debenture due September 1, 2021 issued in the principal amount of

$1,000

by NEECH. Each stock purchase contract requires the holder to purchase by no later than September 1, 2019 (the final settlement date) for a price of

$50

in cash, a number of shares of NEE common stock (subject to antidilution adjustments) based on a price per share range of

$127.63

to

$159.54

. If purchased on the final settlement date, as of

December 31, 2017

, the number of shares issued would (subject to antidilution adjustments) range from

0.3931

shares if the applicable market value of a share of common stock is less than or equal to

$127.63

to

0.3144

shares if the applicable market value of a share is equal to or greater than

$159.54

, with applicable market value to be determined using the average closing prices of NEE common stock over a


-day trading period ending August 28, 2019. Total annual distributions on the equity units are at the rate of

6.123%

, consisting of interest on the debentures (

1.65%

per year) and payments under the stock purchase contracts (

4.473%

per year). The interest rate on the debentures is expected to be reset on or after March 1, 2019. A holder of an equity unit may satisfy its purchase obligation with proceeds raised from remarketing the NEECH debentures that are part of its equity unit. The undivided beneficial ownership interest in the NEECH debenture that is a component of each Corporate Unit is pledged to NEE to secure the holder's obligation to purchase NEE common stock under the related stock purchase contract. If a successful remarketing does not occur on or before the third business day prior to the final settlement date, and a holder has not notified NEE of its intention to settle the stock purchase contract with cash, the debentures that are components of the Corporate Units will be used to satisfy in full the holders' obligations to purchase NEE common stock under the related stock purchase contracts on the final settlement date. The debentures are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NEE.

Prior to the issuance of NEE’s common stock, the stock purchase contracts, if dilutive, will be reflected in NEE’s diluted earnings per share calculations using the treasury stock method. Under this method, the number of shares of NEE common stock used in calculating diluted earnings per share is deemed to be increased by the excess, if any, of the number of shares that would be issued upon settlement of the stock purchase contracts over the number of shares that could be purchased by NEE in the market, at the average market price during the period, using the proceeds receivable upon settlement.

12. Asset Retirement Obligations

FPL's AROs relate primarily to the nuclear decommissioning obligations of its nuclear units. FPL's AROs other than nuclear decommissioning obligations are not significant. The accounting provisions result in timing differences in the recognition of legal asset retirement costs for financial reporting purposes and the method the FPSC allows FPL to recover in rates. NEER's AROs relate primarily to the nuclear decommissioning obligations of its nuclear plants and obligations for the dismantlement of certain of its wind and solar facilities. See Note 1 - Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs.

A rollforward of NEE's and FPL's AROs is as follows:

______________________

(a)

Primarily reflects the effect of revised cost estimates to dismantle certain of NEER’s wind and solar facilities.

(b)

Includes approximately

$13 million

reclassified to liabilities associated with assets held for sale in NEE's consolidated balance sheets. See Note 1 - Assets and Liabilities Associated with Assets Held for Sale.

(c)

Primarily reflects the effect of the revised cost estimate due to the change in useful life of Duane Arnold. See Note 4 - Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.

Restricted funds for the payment of future expenditures to decommission NEE's and FPL's nuclear units included in special use funds on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets are as follows (see Note 4 - Special Use Funds):

NEE and FPL have identified but not recognized ARO liabilities related to electric transmission and distribution assets resulting from easements over property not owned by NEE or FPL. These easements are generally perpetual and only require retirement action upon abandonment or cessation of use of the property or facility for its specified purpose. The ARO liability is not estimable for such easements as NEE and FPL intend to use these properties indefinitely. In the event NEE and FPL decide to abandon or cease the use of a particular easement, an ARO liability would be recorded at that time.

13. Commitments and Contingencies

Commitments

- NEE and its subsidiaries have made commitments in connection with a portion of their projected capital expenditures. Capital expenditures at FPL include, among other things, the cost for construction or acquisition of additional facilities and equipment to meet customer demand, as well as capital improvements to and maintenance of existing facilities and the procurement of nuclear fuel. At NEER, capital expenditures include, among other things, the cost, including capitalized interest, for construction and development of wind and solar projects and the procurement of nuclear fuel, as well as the investment in the development and construction of its natural gas pipeline assets. Capital expenditures for Corporate and Other primarily include the cost to maintain existing transmission facilities at NextEra Energy Transmission, LLC

.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

At

December 31, 2017

, estimated capital expenditures for


through


for which applicable internal approvals (and also, if required, regulatory approvals such as FPSC approvals for FPL) have been received were as follows:

______________________

(a)

Includes AFUDC of approximately $

118 million

, $

58 million

,

$49 million

,

$33 million

and $

16 million

for 2018 through 2022, respectively.

(b)

Includes land, generation structures, transmission interconnection and integration and licensing.

(c)

Consists of capital expenditures for new wind projects, repowering of existing wind projects and related transmission totaling approximately

3,600

MW.

(d)

Includes capital expenditures for new solar projects and related transmission totaling approximately


MW.

(e)

Includes equity contributions associated with an equity investment in a joint venture that is constructing a natural gas pipeline. The natural gas pipeline is pending FERC approval to proceed with construction.

The above estimates are subject to continuing review and adjustment and actual capital expenditures may vary significantly from these estimates.

Contracts

- In addition to the commitments made in connection with the estimated capital expenditures included in the table in Commitments above, FPL has commitments under long-term purchased power and fuel contracts. At

December 31, 2017

, FPL was obligated under a take-or-pay purchased power contract to pay for


MW annually through


. FPL made an approximately

$90 million

payment to JEA, the

80%

owner of SJRPP in connection with the shutdown of SJRPP in January 2018, which had the effect of terminating this take-or-pay purchased power contract, retiring SJRPP and eliminating FPL's

20%

ownership interest. In connection with the FPSC's approval of the retirement, FPL recorded a regulatory asset of approximately

$90 million

, which is included in current and noncurrent regulatory assets on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets at

December 31, 2017

and will be amortized over the remaining life of the take-or-pay purchased power contract (October 2021) and recovered through the capacity clause. At

December 31, 2017

, the net book value of approximately

$191 million

was included in plant in service and other property on FPL's balance sheets (electric plant in service and other property for NEE) with respect to SJRPP. In January 2018, NEE and FPL reclassified the net book value to a regulatory asset. Approximately

$150 million

of the regulatory asset will be amortized over

15 years

in base rates beginning July 1, 2018 and the remainder will be amortized over

10 years

through the environmental cost recovery clause beginning when FPL's base rates are next adjusted in a general base rate case. In addition, in connection with the shutdown of the plant, FPL had regulatory liabilities of approximately

$62 million

which will be refunded to customers through the capacity clause over the remaining life of the take-or-pay purchased power contract. FPL also has various firm pay-for-performance contracts to purchase approximately


MW from certain cogenerators and small power producers with expiration dates ranging from


through


. The purchased power contracts provide for capacity and energy payments. Energy payments are based on the actual power taken under these contracts. Capacity payments for the pay-for-performance contracts are subject to the facilities meeting certain contract conditions. FPL has contracts with expiration dates through


for the purchase and transportation of natural gas and coal, and storage of natural gas.

At

December 31, 2017

, NEER has entered into contracts with expiration dates ranging from

late February 2018

through


primarily for the purchase of wind turbines, wind towers and solar modules and related construction and development activities, as well as for the supply of uranium, and the conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel and has made commitments for the construction of natural gas pipelines. Approximately

$2.2 billion

of related commitments are included in the estimated capital expenditures table in Commitments above. In addition, NEER has contracts primarily for the purchase, transportation and storage of natural gas with expiration dates ranging from

March 2018

commitment to invest in clean power and technology businesses through 2021.

(e)

Excludes approximately

$60 million

of joint obligations of NEECH and NEER which are included in the NEER amounts above.

Insurance

- Liability for accidents at nuclear power plants is governed by the Price-Anderson Act, which limits the liability of nuclear reactor owners to the amount of insurance available from both private sources and an industry retrospective payment plan. In accordance with this Act, NEE maintains $

450 million

of private liability insurance per site, which is the maximum obtainable, and participates in a secondary financial protection system, which provides up to $

13.0 billion

of liability insurance coverage per incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S. Under the secondary financial protection system, NEE is subject to retrospective assessments of up to $

1.0 billion

($

509 million

for FPL), plus any applicable taxes, per incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S., payable at a rate not to exceed $

152 million

($

76 million

for FPL) per incident per year. NEE and FPL are contractually entitled to recover a proportionate share of such assessments from the owners of minority interests in Seabrook, Duane Arnold and St. Lucie Unit No. 2, which approximates $

15 million

, $

38 million

and $

19 million

, plus any applicable taxes, per incident, respectively.

NEE participates in a nuclear insurance mutual company that provides $

2.75 billion

of limited insurance coverage per occurrence per site for property damage, decontamination and premature decommissioning risks at its nuclear plants and a sublimit of

$1.5 billion

for non-nuclear perils, except for Duane Arnold which has a sublimit of

$1.0 billion

. NEE participates in co-insurance of

10%

of the first $

400 million

of losses per site per occurrence. The proceeds from such insurance, however, must first be used for reactor stabilization and site decontamination before they can be used for plant repair. NEE also participates in an insurance program that provides limited coverage for replacement power costs if a nuclear plant is out of service for an extended period of time because of an accident. In the event of an accident at one of NEE's or another participating insured's nuclear plants, NEE could be assessed up to $

178 million

($

108 million

for FPL), plus any applicable taxes, in retrospective premiums in a policy year. NEE and FPL are contractually entitled to recover a proportionate share of such assessments from the owners of minority interests in Seabrook, Duane Arnold and St. Lucie Unit No. 2, which approximates $

2 million

, $

5 million

and $

4 million

, plus any applicable taxes, respectively.

Due to the high cost and limited coverage available from third-party insurers, NEE does not have property insurance coverage for a substantial portion of either its transmission and distribution property or natural gas pipeline assets. If FPL's future storm restoration costs exceed the storm reserve, FPL may recover storm restoration costs, subject to prudence review by the FPSC, either through surcharges approved by the FPSC or through securitization provisions pursuant to Florida law. See Note 1 - Securitized Storm-Recovery Costs, Storm Fund and Storm Reserve.

In the event of a loss, the amount of insurance available might not be adequate to cover property damage and other expenses incurred. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered from customers in the case of FPL, would be borne by NEE and FPL and could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

14. Segment Information

- The following table presents fees billed for professional services rendered by Deloitte & Touche LLP, the member firms of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, and their respective affiliates (collectively, Deloitte & Touche) for the fiscal years ended

December 31, 2017

and


. The amounts presented below reflect allocations from NEE for FPL's portion of the fees, as well as amounts billed directly to FPL.

______________________

(a)

Audit fees consist of fees billed for professional services rendered for the audit of FPL's and NEE's annual consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year, the reviews of the financial statements included in FPL's and NEE's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q during the fiscal year and the audit of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, comfort letters, consents, and other services related to SEC matters and services in connection with annual and semi-annual filings of NEE's financial statements with the Japanese Ministry of Finance.

(b)

Audit-related fees consist of fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of FPL's and NEE's consolidated financial statements and are not reported under audit fees. These fees primarily relate to subscription services for an accounting research tool.

(c)

Tax fees consist of fees billed for professional services rendered for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning.

In 2017 and 2016, approximately $7,000 and $66,000, respectively, was paid related to tax advice and planning services. All other tax fees in 2017 and in 2016 related to tax compliance services.

(d)

All other fees consist of fees for products and services other than the services reported under the other named categories. In 2017 and 2016, these fees related to training.

In accordance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Audit Committee Charter and the Audit Committee's pre-approval policy for services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm, all services performed by Deloitte & Touche are approved in advance by the Audit Committee, except for audits of certain trust funds where the fees are paid by the trust. Audit and audit-related services specifically identified in an appendix to the pre-approval policy are pre-approved by the Audit Committee each year. This pre-approval allows management to request the specified audit and audit-related services on an as-needed basis during the year, provided any such services are reviewed with the Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. Any audit or audit-related service for which the fee is expected to exceed $250,000, or that involves a service not listed on the pre-approval list, must be specifically approved by the Audit Committee prior to commencement of such service. In addition, the Audit Committee approves all services other than audit and audit-related services performed by Deloitte & Touche in advance of the commencement of such work. The Audit Committee has delegated to the Chair of the committee the right to approve audit, audit-related, tax and other services, within certain limitations, between meetings of the Audit Committee, provided any such decision is presented to the Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. At each Audit Committee meeting (other than meetings held to review earnings materials), the Audit Committee reviews a schedule of services for which Deloitte & Touche has been engaged since the prior Audit Committee meeting under existing pre-approvals and the estimated fees for those services. In


and


, none of the amounts presented above represent services provided to NEE or FPL by Deloitte & Touche that were approved by the Audit Committee after services were rendered pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) of Regulation S-X

(which provides for a waiver of the otherwise applicable pre-approval requirement if certain conditions are met).
