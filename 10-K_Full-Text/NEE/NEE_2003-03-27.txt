Fuel sources for these projects were as follows:

FPL Energy is actively involved in managing more than 84% of its projects, which represent approximately 96% of the net generating capacity in which FPL Energy has an ownership interest.

As a result of FPL Energy's continued growth, capital expenditures and investments totaled approximately $2.103 billion, $1.977 billion and $507 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  Capital expenditures for 2003 through 2007 are estimated to be as follows:

·

$67 million ($41 million after tax) to write-off previously capitalized development costs,

·

$16 million ($10 million after tax) related to the renegotiation of an agreement to significantly reduce the commitment to purchase gas turbines and other related equipment and

·

$20 million ($12 million after tax) related to the realignment of the organization and the termination of an operating lease agreement with an SPE and related credit facility used to finance certain turbine purchases.

Interest rate risk - The special use funds of FPL Group include restricted funds set aside to cover the cost of storm damage for FPL and for the decommissioning of FPL Group's and FPL's nuclear power plants.  A portion of these funds is invested in fixed income debt securities carried at their market value of approximately $1.184 billion and $1.020 billion ($1.066 billion and $1.020 billion for FPL) at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Adjustments to market value result in a corresponding adjustment to the related liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment for FPL.  The market value adjustments of FPL Group's non-rate regulated operations result in a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income.  Because the funds set aside by FPL for storm damage could be needed at any time, the related investments are generally more liquid and, therefore, are less sensitive to changes in interest rates.  The nuclear decommissioning funds, in contrast, are generally invested in longer-term se
curities, as decommissioning activities are not expected to begin until at least 2012.  See Note 12.

Special Use Funds

-

The special use funds consist of FPL's storm fund assets totaling $183 million and $145 million, and FPL Group's nuclear decommissioning fund assets totaling $1.738 billion and $1.463 billion ($1.510 billion and $1.463 billion for FPL) at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  Securities held in the special use funds are carried at estimated fair value based on quoted market prices.  FPL Group's nuclear decommissioning funds consist of approximately 40% equity securities and 60% municipal, government, corporate and mortgage- and other asset-backed debt securities (39% and 61% for FPL, respectively) with a weighted-average maturity of approximately eight years.  FPL's storm fund primarily consists of municipal debt securities with a weighted-average maturity of approximately four years. The cost of securities sold is determined on the specific identification method.

The following tables provide the special use funds approximate gains and losses and proceeds from the sale of securities:
