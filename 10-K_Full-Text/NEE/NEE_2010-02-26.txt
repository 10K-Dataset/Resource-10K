FPL
OPERATIONS

General.

FPL
was incorporated under the laws of Florida in 1925 and is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of FPL Group.  FPL supplies electric service to a
population of more than 8.7 million throughout most of the east and lower west
coasts of Florida.  During 2009, FPL served approximately 4.5 million
customer accounts.  The percentage of FPL's operating revenues by
customer class was as follows:

Over the
last ten years, FPL's average annual customer growth has been
1.8%.  However, beginning in 2007, FPL has experienced a slowdown in
retail customer growth and a decline in non-weather related usage per retail
customer.  Retail customer growth in 2008 was 0.3%.  FPL's
average number of retail customers declined slightly during the first three
quarters of 2009 and remained essentially unchanged during the fourth quarter of
2009; the decline for the full year was 0.2%.  FPL believes that the
economic slowdown, the downturn in the housing market and the credit crisis that
have affected the country and the state of Florida have contributed to the
slowdown in customer growth and to the decline in non-weather related usage per
retail customer.  In December 2009, the unemployment rate in Florida
was 11.8%.  Beginning in 2007, FPL experienced an increase in inactive
accounts (accounts with installed meters without corresponding customer names)
and in low-usage customers (customers using less than 200 kwh per month), which
have contributed to the decline in retail customer growth and non-weather
related usage per retail customer.  In 2009, inactive accounts and
low-usage customers continued to increase much of the year but declined slightly
in the fourth quarter.  FPL is unable to predict whether or when
growth in customers and non-weather related customer usage might return to
previous trends.

Regulation.

FPL's
retail operations provided approximately 99% of FPL's 2009 operating
revenues.  Retail operations are regulated by the FPSC, which has
jurisdiction over retail rates, service territory, issuances of securities,
planning, siting and construction of facilities and other
matters.  FPL is also subject to regulation by the FERC with respect
to certain aspects of its operations, including, but not limited to, the
acquisition and disposition of facilities, interchange and transmission services
and wholesale purchases and sales of electric energy.  The NERC
established mandatory reliability standards in 2007 to ensure the reliability of
the U.S. electric transmission and generation system and to prevent major system
blackouts.  Violations for non-compliance are subject to penalties of
up to $1 million per day per violation.  In addition, FPL's nuclear
power plants are subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC.  NRC
regulations govern the granting of licenses for the construction, operation and
retirement of nuclear power plants and subject these plants to continuing review
and regulation.


Retail
Ratemaking.

The underlying concept of utility ratemaking is to
set rates at a level that allows the utility the opportunity to collect from
customers total revenues (revenue requirements) equal to its cost of providing
service, including a reasonable rate of return on invested
capital.  To accomplish this, the FPSC uses various ratemaking
mechanisms, including, among other things, base rates and cost recovery
clauses.

Base Rates

- In general, the
basic costs of providing electric service, other than fuel and certain other
costs, are recovered through base rates, which are designed to recover the costs
of constructing, operating and maintaining the utility system.  These
basic costs include O&M expenses, depreciation and taxes, as well as a
return on FPL's investment in assets used and useful in providing electric
service (rate base).  At the time base rates are determined, the
allowed rate of return on rate base approximates FPL's estimated
weighted-average cost of capital, which includes its costs for outstanding debt
and, typically, an allowed ROE.  The FPSC monitors FPL's actual
regulatory ROE through a surveillance report that is filed monthly by FPL with
the FPSC.  The FPSC does not provide assurance that an allowed ROE
will be achieved.  Base rates are determined in rate proceedings or
through negotiated settlements, which occur at irregular intervals at the
initiative of FPL, the FPSC, the State of Florida Office of Public Counsel or a
substantially affected party.  Base rates remain in effect until new
base rates are approved by the FPSC.

In March
2009, FPL filed a petition with the FPSC requesting, among other things, a
permanent base rate increase of approximately $1 billion in 2010 and an
additional $250 million in 2011, which included additions to the storm and
property insurance reserve.  The requested increases were based on a
proposed regulatory ROE of 12.5% and excluded amounts associated with the
proposed extension of a Generation Base Rate Adjustment (GBRA) mechanism, which
allowed for automatic adjustments in retail base rates when approved power
plants achieved commercial operation, and certain proposed cost recovery clause
adjustments.

In
January 2010, the FPSC orally ruled with respect to FPL's March 2009 petition
(January 2010 rate ruling) and indicated that the ruling would be reflected in a
final written order to be issued in February 2010 (final order).  The
January 2010 rate ruling indicated that new retail base rates would be
established for FPL effective March 1, 2010, would increase retail base
rates by approximately $75 million on an annualized basis, would establish a
regulatory ROE of 10.0% with a range of plus or minus 100 basis points and would
shift certain costs from retail base rates to the capacity
clause.  The January 2010 rate ruling also indicated that depreciation
expense would be reduced over the next four years.  See Management's
Discussion - Results of Operations - FPL.  The January 2010 rate
ruling also indicated, among other things, that any additional base rate
increase for 2011, the continuation of the GBRA mechanism and any additions to
the storm and property insurance reserve would be denied.  As of the
date of this report, the final order remains pending.  Upon issuance
of the final order, parties have the right to file motions with the FPSC for
reconsideration of some or all of the final order, or to appeal some or all of
the final order to the Florida Supreme Court.  In response to
inquiries regarding potential inconsistencies in calculations underlying the
January 2010 rate ruling, staff for the FPSC has indicated it would address any
matters raised by the parties before the final order following the filing of any
motions for reconsideration.  FPL cannot predict the specific
treatment of any particular issue in the final order.

FPL is
evaluating the impact of the January 2010 rate ruling on its financial position,
including its credit quality and ability to attract capital over the long term
(see Management's Discussion - Liquidity and Capital Resources).  FPL
has suspended activities on the following projects representing approximately
$10 billion of investment over the next five years until the financial impact of
the final order, along with other factors, such as load-growth estimates, fuel
cost forecasts, demand side management and environmental incentives, can be
reviewed (see Capital Expenditures below):

FPL is
also evaluating its options with respect to future regulatory actions regarding
the January 2010 rate ruling and, when it is issued, the final order, as well as
assessing the cost structure of its ongoing operations and reviewing other
planned capital expenditures for appropriate reductions.

Under a
rate agreement approved in 2005 (2005 rate agreement), retail base rates did not
increase except to allow recovery, under the GBRA mechanism, of the revenue
requirements of FPL's three power plants that achieved commercial operation
during the term of the 2005 rate agreement.  Retail base rates
increased when Turkey Point Unit No. 5 was placed in service in 2007 and when
WCEC Units Nos. 1 and 2 were placed in service in 2009.  During
the term of the 2005 rate agreement, FPL did not have an authorized regulatory
ROE for the purpose of addressing earnings levels; however, for all other
regulatory purposes, FPL had an ROE of 11.75%.  Under the terms of the
2005 rate agreement, FPL's electric property depreciation rates were based upon
the comprehensive depreciation studies it filed with the FPSC in March 2005;
however, FPL reduced depreciation on its plant in service by $125 million each
year, as allowed by the 2005 rate agreement.  The 2005 rate agreement
also provided for a revenue sharing mechanism, whereby revenues from retail base
operations in excess of certain thresholds would be shared with
customers.  During the term of the 2005 rate agreement, FPL's revenues
did not exceed the thresholds.


Cost Recovery Clauses

- Cost
recovery clauses, which are designed to permit full recovery of certain costs
and provide a return on certain assets allowed to be recovered through the
various clauses, include substantially all fuel, purchased power and interchange
expenses, conservation and certain environmental-related expenses, certain
revenue taxes and franchise fees.  Beginning in 2009, pre-construction
costs and carrying charges on construction costs for new nuclear capacity and
costs incurred for FPL's three solar generating facilities, one of which was
placed into service in 2009 and two of which are under construction, are also
recovered through cost recovery clauses.  These costs are recovered
through levelized monthly charges per kwh or kw, depending on the customer's
rate class, pursuant to the FPSC's cost recovery clauses.  These cost
recovery clause charges are calculated at least annually based on estimated
costs and estimated customer usage for the following year, plus or minus a
true-up adjustment to reflect the variance of actual costs and usage from the
estimates used in setting the adjustment charges for prior
periods.  An adjustment to the levelized charges may be approved
during the course of a year to reflect a projected variance based on actual
costs and usage.

In 2009,
fuel clause recoveries were approximately $5.9 billion.  FPL uses a
risk management fuel procurement program which was approved by the FPSC at the
program's inception.  The FPSC reviews the program activities and
results for prudence on an annual basis as part of its annual review of fuel
costs.  The program is intended to manage fuel price volatility by
locking in fuel prices for a portion of FPL's fuel requirements.  See
Energy Marketing and Trading below, Management's Discussion - Results of
Operations - FPL, Note 1 - Regulation and Note 3.  Pursuant
to an FPSC order, FPL was required to refund in the form of a one-time credit to
retail customers' bills the 2009 year-end estimated fuel overrecovery; in
January 2010, approximately $403 million was refunded to retail
customers.  At December 31, 2009, approximately $356 million of
retail fuel revenues were overrecovered.  The difference between the
refund and the December 31, 2009 overrecovery will be collected from retail
customers in a subsequent period.

Capacity
payments to other utilities and generating companies for purchased power are
recovered from customers through the capacity clause and base
rates.  Beginning in March 2010, such payments will be recovered
entirely through the capacity clause.  In accordance with the FPSC's
nuclear cost recovery rule, FPL also recovers pre-construction costs and
carrying charges (equal to a pretax AFUDC rate) on construction costs for new
nuclear capacity through the capacity clause.  Once the new capacity
goes into service, it is expected that construction costs will be recovered
through base rate increases.  See Nuclear Operations
below.  In 2009, capacity clause recoveries were approximately $772
million.

Costs
associated with implementing energy conservation programs are recovered from
customers through the conservation clause.  In 2009, conservation
clause recoveries were approximately $198 million.  Certain costs of
complying with federal, state and local environmental regulations enacted after
April 1993 and costs associated with FPL's three solar facilities are recovered
through the environmental clause.  In 2009, environmental clause
recoveries were approximately $91 million.  See Environmental and
Solar Operations below.

Other Recovery Mechanisms

-
FPL maintains a funded storm and property insurance reserve.  Four
hurricanes in 2005 and three hurricanes in 2004 caused major damage in parts of
FPL's service territory.  Storm restoration costs incurred by FPL
during 2005 and 2004 exceeded the amount in the storm and property insurance
reserve, resulting in a storm reserve deficiency.  In 2007, FPL formed
a wholly-owned bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary for the purpose of
issuing storm-recovery bonds, pursuant to the securitization provisions of the
Florida Statutes and an FPSC financing order.  In May 2007, the FPL
subsidiary issued $652 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured
bonds (storm-recovery bonds), primarily for the after-tax equivalent of the
total of FPL's unrecovered balance of the 2004 storm restoration costs, the 2005
storm restoration costs and approximately $200 million to reestablish FPL's
storm and property insurance reserve.  The storm-recovery bonds,
including interest and bond issuance costs, are being repaid through a surcharge
to retail customers.  Prior to the issuance of these storm-recovery
bonds, FPL had been recovering the 2004 storm restoration costs from retail
customers through a storm damage surcharge.  See Management's
Discussion - Results of Operations - FPL and Note 9 - FPL.

The FPSC
has the authority to disallow recovery of costs that it considers excessive or
imprudently incurred.  Such costs may include, among others, fuel and
O&M expenses, the cost of replacing power lost when fossil and nuclear units
are unavailable, storm restoration costs and costs associated with the
construction or acquisition of new facilities.

Competition.

FPL
currently holds 176 franchise agreements to provide electric service in various
municipalities and counties in Florida with varying expiration dates through
2040.  Of the 176 franchise agreements, 10 expire in 2010, 9 expire in
2011 and 157 expire during the period 2012 through 2040.  Negotiations
are ongoing to renew franchises with upcoming expirations.  FPL also
provides service to 13 other municipalities and to 22 unincorporated areas
within its service area without franchise agreements.  FPL considers
its franchises to be adequate for the conduct of its business.


FPL
currently faces competition from other suppliers of electrical energy to
wholesale customers and from alternative energy sources and self-generation for
other customer groups, primarily industrial customers.  The FERC has
jurisdiction over potential changes that could affect competition in wholesale
transactions.  In 2009, operating revenues from wholesale and
industrial customers combined represented approximately 4% of FPL's total
operating revenues.  Various states, other than Florida, have enacted
legislation or have state commissions that have issued orders designed to allow
retail customers to choose their electricity supplier.  Management
believes it is unlikely there will be any state actions to restructure the
retail electric industry in Florida in the near future.  If the basis
of regulation for some or all of FPL's business changes from cost-based
regulation, existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off
unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or
refund.  Further, other aspects of the business, such as generation
assets and long-term power purchase commitments, would need to be reviewed to
assess their recoverability in a changed regulatory environment.  See
Management's Discussion - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates -
Regulatory Accounting.

The FPSC
promotes cost competitiveness in the building of new steam generating capacity
by requiring investor-owned electric utilities, such as FPL, to issue an RFP
except when the FPSC determines that an exception from the RFP process is in the
public interest.  The RFP process allows independent power producers
and others to bid to supply the new generating capacity.  If a bidder
has the most cost-effective alternative, meets other criteria such as financial
viability and demonstrates adequate expertise and experience in building and/or
operating generating capacity of the type proposed, the investor-owned electric
utility would seek to negotiate a power purchase agreement with the selected
bidder and request that the FPSC approve the terms of the power purchase
agreement and, if appropriate, provide the required authorization for the
construction of the bidder's generating capacity.  In 2007, the FPSC
eliminated the requirement for utilities to issue an RFP for new nuclear power
plants sited after June 2006.  See Nuclear Operations below regarding
the approval by the FPSC for two additional nuclear units.

Environmental.

FPL
is subject to environmental laws and regulations and is affected by some of the
emerging issues included in the Environmental Matters section.  FPL
expects to seek recovery through the environmental clause for compliance costs
associated with any new environmental laws and regulations.

During
2009, FPL spent approximately $214 million on capital additions to comply with
existing environmental laws and regulations.  FPL's capital
expenditures to comply with existing environmental laws and regulations are
estimated to be $424 million for 2010 through 2012, including approximately $236
million in 2010, and are included in estimated planned capital expenditures set
forth in Capital Expenditures below.

System Capability
and Load.

At December 31, 2009, FPL's resources for
serving load consisted of 26,682 mw, of which 24,530 mw were from FPL-owned
facilities (see Item 2 - Generating Facilities) and 2,152 mw were available
through purchased power contracts (see Note 14 -
Contracts).  FPL's projected reserve margin for the summer of 2010 is
approximately 22%.  This reserve margin is expected to be achieved
through the combination of output from FPL's active generating units (excluding
solar which is considered non-firm), purchased power contracts and the
capability to reduce peak demand through the implementation of demand side
management programs, including load management, which was estimated to be
capable of reducing demand by 1,801 mw at December 31, 2009, and energy
efficiency and conservation programs.  In December 2009, the FPSC
issued an order that will require Florida utilities, including FPL, to meet
higher demand side management goals for both demand and energy beginning in
2010, and to file plans to meet these goals by March 30,
2010.  FPL and the other Florida utilities have filed motions for
reconsideration of the FPSC order.  Occasionally, unusually cold
temperatures during the winter months result in significant increases in
electricity usage for short periods of time.  However, customer usage
and operating revenues are typically higher during the summer months, largely
due to the prevalent use of air conditioning in FPL's service
territory.  During 2009, the highest peak load FPL served was
22,351 mw.  The highest peak load FPL has served to date was
24,346 mw, which occurred on January 11, 2010.  FPL had adequate
resources available at the time of this peak to meet customer
demand.  See Fossil Operations, Nuclear Operations and Solar
Operations below regarding generation projects currently under
construction.

Fuel
Mix.

FPL's generating plants use a variety of
fuels.  The diverse fuel options, along with purchased power, are
intended to enable FPL to shift between sources of generation to achieve a more
economical fuel mix.  See Fossil Operations and Nuclear Operations
below, and Item 2 - Generating Facilities.

FPL's
2009 fuel mix based on kwh produced was as follows:

Fossil
Operations.

FPL owns and operates 81 units that use fossil
fuels such as natural gas and/or oil, and has a joint-ownership interest in
three coal units.  FPL's fossil units are out of service from time to
time for routine maintenance or on standby during periods of reduced electricity
demand.  FPL is currently constructing a natural gas-fired
combined-cycle unit of approximately 1,220 mw at its WCEC, which is expected to
be placed in service by mid-2011.  In 2008, the FPSC approved FPL's
plan to modernize its Cape Canaveral and Riviera power plants to high-efficiency
natural gas-fired units.  Each modernized plant is expected to provide
approximately 1,200 mw of capacity and be placed in service by 2013 and 2014,
respectively.  However, FPL has suspended activities on the
modernization of the two power plants.  See Retail Ratemaking above
and Capital Expenditures below.

FPL has
four firm transportation contracts in place with FGT, two firm transportation
contracts with Gulfstream and one firm transportation contract with Southeast
Supply Header, LLC, that together are expected to satisfy substantially all of
the anticipated needs for natural gas transportation at its existing
units.  The four existing FGT contracts expire between 2021 and 2025,
while both Gulfstream contracts expire in 2032.  The Southeast Supply
Header contract expires in 2020.  To the extent desirable, FPL can
also purchase interruptible natural gas transportation service from FGT and
Gulfstream based on pipeline availability.  FPL has several short- and
medium-term natural gas supply contracts to provide a portion of FPL's
anticipated needs for natural gas.  The remainder of FPL's natural gas
requirements is purchased in the spot market.  FPL has a long-term
agreement for the storage of natural gas that expires in 2013.  In
addition, FPL has entered into several long-term agreements for storage capacity
and transportation of natural gas from facilities that have not yet started
construction, or if started, have not yet completed
construction.  These agreements range from 15 to 25 years in length
and contain firm commitments by FPL totaling up to approximately $175 million
annually or $4.3 billion over the terms of the agreements.  These firm
commitments are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, including
completion of construction of the facilities in 2011.  See
Note 14 - Contracts.  FPL's oil requirements are obtained under
short- and medium-term contracts and in the spot market.

FPL has,
through its joint ownership interest in St. Johns River Power Park (SJRPP) Units
Nos. 1 and 2, a coal supply and transportation contract for all of the 2010 fuel
needs and a portion of the 2011 fuel needs for those units.  All of
the transportation requirements and a portion of the coal supply needs for
Scherer Unit No. 4 are covered by a series of annual and long-term
contracts.  FPL's remaining fuel requirements for these units will be
obtained in the spot market.  See
Note 14 - Contracts.

Nuclear
Operations.

FPL owns, or has undivided interests in, and
operates four nuclear units, two at Turkey Point and two at St. Lucie, with a
total net generating capability of 2,939 mw.  The nuclear units are
periodically removed from service to accommodate normal refueling and
maintenance outages, repairs and certain other
modifications.  Scheduled nuclear refueling outages typically require
the unit to be removed from service for approximately 30 days.  This
duration is longer for expanded scope outages.  The following table
summarizes certain information related to FPL's nuclear units:

FPL is
in the process of adding approximately 400 mw of baseload capacity at its
existing nuclear units at St. Lucie and Turkey Point, which additional capacity
is projected to be placed in service by the end of 2012.  The
construction costs relating to the 400 mw of baseload capacity yet to be
incurred as of December 31, 2009 are included in the estimated planned
capital expenditures set forth in Capital Expenditures below.  As part
of the conditions of certification by the state of Florida for this project, FPL
is required to implement a monitoring plan on the Turkey Point cooling canals
due to concerns over potential saltwater intrusion beyond FPL's
property.  Monitoring under the plan includes collection of data for
two years prior to and two years after the date the additional capacity is
placed in service in order to establish a baseline and assess various
environmental impacts of the cooling canals on surrounding areas.  The
potential results of the monitoring plan are uncertain and the financial and
operational impacts on FPL, if any, cannot be determined at this
time.  In 2008, the FPSC approved FPL's need petition for two
additional nuclear units at its Turkey Point site with projected in-service
dates between 2018 and 2020.  The two units combined are expected to
add approximately 2,200 mw of baseload capacity.  Additional approvals
from other regulatory agencies will be required later in the development
process.  However, FPL has suspended development activities on the two
new nuclear units at its Turkey Point site beyond what is required to receive a
license for each unit from the NRC.  See Retail Ratemaking above and
Capital Expenditures below.


FPL
leases nuclear fuel for all four of its nuclear units.  See
Note 1 - Nuclear Fuel.  FPL Group and FPL consolidate the lessor
entity, a VIE.  See Note 9 - FPL.  The contracts for the
supply, conversion, enrichment and fabrication of FPL's nuclear fuel have
expiration dates ranging from March 2010 through 2022.  Under the
Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the DOE is responsible for the development of a
repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive
waste.  As required by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, FPL is a party to
contracts with the DOE to provide for disposal of spent nuclear fuel from its
Turkey Point and St. Lucie nuclear units.  The DOE was required to
construct permanent disposal facilities and take title to and provide
transportation and disposal for spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998 for
a specified fee based on current generation from nuclear power
plants.  Through December 31, 2009, FPL has paid approximately
$629 million in such fees to the U.S. Government's nuclear waste
fund.  The DOE did not meet its statutory obligation for disposal of
spent nuclear fuel under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.  In 2009, FPL
and certain nuclear plant joint owners signed a settlement agreement (spent fuel
settlement agreement) with the U.S. Government agreeing to dismiss with
prejudice lawsuits filed against the U.S. Government seeking damages caused by
the DOE's failure to dispose of spent nuclear fuel from FPL's nuclear
plants.  The spent fuel settlement agreement permits FPL to make
annual filings to recover certain spent fuel storage costs incurred by FPL which
will be payable by the U.S. Government on an annual basis.  Through
December 31, 2009, FPL has collected approximately $82 million of the
amount due from the U.S. Government pursuant to the spent fuel settlement
agreement and has paid approximately $5 million to the joint owners of St. Lucie
Unit No. 2.  An additional payment from the U.S. Government of
approximately $18 million relating to costs incurred in 2008 is
pending.  FPL plans to file a claim for spent fuel storage costs
incurred during 2009 by April 2010.  FPL will continue to pay fees to
the U.S. Government's nuclear waste fund.  The DOE filed a license
application for a permanent disposal facility for spent nuclear fuel with the
NRC in 2008, and a licensing proceeding is ongoing before the
NRC.  However, it is uncertain when a permanent disposal facility will
be constructed and when it would be ready to begin receiving spent nuclear fuel
shipments.

FPL uses
both on-site storage pools and dry storage casks to store spent nuclear fuel
generated by St. Lucie Units Nos. 1 and 2, which should allow FPL to
store all spent nuclear fuel at this facility through license
expiration.  FPL currently stores all spent nuclear fuel generated by
Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 in on-site storage pools.  These
spent nuclear fuel storage pools do not have sufficient storage capacity for the
life of the respective units.  Beginning in 2011, FPL plans to begin
using dry storage casks to store spent nuclear fuel generated by the Turkey
Point facility, which should allow FPL to store all spent nuclear fuel at this
facility through license expiration.

The
NRC's regulations require FPL to submit a plan for decontamination and
decommissioning five years before the projected end of plant
operation.  FPL's current plans, under the operating licenses, provide
for prompt dismantlement of Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 with
decommissioning activities commencing in 2032 and 2033,
respectively.  Current plans provide for St. Lucie Unit No. 1 to
be mothballed beginning in 2036 with decommissioning activities to be integrated
with the prompt dismantlement of St. Lucie Unit No. 2 at the end of its
useful life in 2043.  See estimated decommissioning cost data in
Note 1 - Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of
Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs - FPL.

Solar
Operations.

In 2009, FPL
placed into service its first utility-scale solar generating facility, a 25 mw
photovoltaic (PV) facility in DeSoto County, Florida.  FPL is
currently constructing a 75 mw solar thermal facility in Martin County, Florida
and a 10 mw solar PV facility in Brevard County, Florida, which are expected to
be placed into service by the end of 2010.  The construction costs of
the Martin County and Brevard County solar generating facilities yet to be
incurred as of December 31, 2009 are included in estimated planned capital
expenditures set forth in Capital Expenditures below.

Energy Marketing and
Trading.

EMT buys and sells wholesale energy commodities, such
as natural gas, oil and electricity.  EMT procures natural gas and oil
for FPL's use in power generation and sells excess natural gas, oil and
electricity.  EMT also uses derivative instruments, such as swaps,
options and forwards, to manage the commodity price risk inherent in the
purchase and sale of fuel and electricity.  Substantially all of the
results of EMT's activities are passed through to customers in the fuel or
capacity clauses.  See Retail Ratemaking above, Management's
Discussion - Results of Operations - FPL and Energy Marketing and Trading and
Market Risk Sensitivity and Note 3.

Capital
Expenditures.

Capital expenditures at FPL include, among other
things, the cost for construction or acquisition of additional facilities and
equipment to meet customer demand, as well as capital improvements to and
maintenance of existing facilities.  Planned capital expenditures that
are conditional on obtaining regulatory approvals are not included in the table
below until such approvals are received.


FPL's
actual capital expenditures for 2007 through 2009 and estimated planned capital

Electric and
Magnetic Fields.

EMF are present around electrical facilities,
including, but not limited to, appliances, power lines and building
wiring.  Since the 1970s, there has been public, scientific and
regulatory attention given to the question of whether EMF causes or contributes
to adverse health effects.  U.S. and international scientific
organizations have evaluated the EMF research.  Their reviews have
generally concluded that while some epidemiology studies report an association
with childhood leukemia, controlled laboratory studies do not support that
association and the scientific studies overall have not demonstrated that EMF
cause or contribute to any type of cancer or other disease.

The FDEP established EMF standards for
electricity facilities in 1989 and FPL facilities comply with these
standards.  Future changes in the FDEP regulations could require
additional capital expenditures by FPL for such things as increasing the width
of right of ways or relocating or reconfiguring transmission
facilities.  It is not presently known whether any such expenditures
will be required.  Currently, there are no such changes proposed to
the FDEP regulations

.

Employees.

FPL
had approximately 10,500 employees at December 31,
2009.  Approximately 31% of the employees are represented by the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) under a collective
bargaining agreement with FPL that expires October 31, 2011.

NEXTERA
ENERGY RESOURCES OPERATIONS

General.

NextEra
Energy Resources, a wholly-owned subsidiary of FPL Group Capital, was formed in
1998 to aggregate FPL Group's existing competitive energy
businesses.  It is a limited liability company organized under the
laws of Delaware.  Through its subsidiaries, NextEra Energy Resources
currently owns, develops, constructs, manages and operates primarily domestic
electric-generating facilities in wholesale energy markets.  NextEra
Energy Resources also provides full energy and capacity requirements services
primarily to distribution utilities in certain markets and owns a retail
electric provider based in Texas.  NextEra Energy Resources also
engages in power and gas marketing and trading activities.

At
December 31, 2009, NextEra Energy Resources managed or participated in the
management of approximately 97% of its projects, which represented approximately
99% of the net generating capacity in which NextEra Energy Resources has an
ownership interest.  NextEra Energy Resources had ownership interests
in operating independent power projects with a net generating capability
totaling 18,148 mw (see Item 2 - Generating
Facilities).  Generation capacity spans various regions and is
produced using a variety of fuel sources, thereby reducing overall volatility
related to varying market conditions and seasonality on a portfolio
basis.  At December 31, 2009, the percentage of capacity by
geographic region was:

NextEra
Energy Resources' strategy is, among other things, to continue to maintain its
leadership position in wind, accelerate growth in solar development, continue to
expand its transmission capability, grow its supply-related and non-asset based
businesses, and to develop its natural gas infrastructure
business.  NextEra Energy Resources' supply-related business includes
full energy and capacity requirements services and retail operations, and the
non-asset based business includes power and gas marketing and trading
operations.  NextEra Energy Resources seeks to expand its portfolio
primarily through wind and solar development and acquisitions where economic
prospects are attractive.  In 2009, NextEra Energy Resources added
approximately 1,170 mw of wind generation to its portfolio and expects to add
approximately 1,000 mw of new wind generation in 2010 and 1,000 mw to 1,500 mw
in each of 2011 and 2012.  In addition to wind expansion, NextEra
Energy Resources is considering several solar development opportunities in the
U.S., as well as in Europe.  The wind and solar expansions are subject
to, among other things, continued public policy support, support for the
construction and availability of sufficient transmission facilities and
capacity, continued market demand, supply chain expansion and access to capital
at reasonable cost and on reasonable terms.  NextEra Energy Resources
is evaluating additional natural gas infrastructure opportunities in the U.S.
and will continue to explore additional projects as opportunities become
available.

NextEra
Energy Resources' actual capital expenditures and investments for 2007 through
2009 and estimated planned capital expenditures for 2010 through 2014 as of
December 31, 2009 were as follows:

¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾

(a)

Includes
      capital expenditures for new wind projects that have been identified and

      new wind generation of approximately 1,000 mw in 2010 and 1,000 mw to
      1,500 mw in each of 2011 and 2012, subject to, among other things,
      continued public policy support, support for the construction and
      availability of sufficient transmission facilities and capacity, continued
      market demand, supply chain expansion and access to capital at reasonable
      cost and on reasonable terms.  The cost of the planned wind
      additions for 2011 and 2012 is estimated to be approximately $2.2 billion
      to $3.3 billion in each year, which is not included in the table
      above.

Commitments.

Portfolio by
Category.

NextEra Energy
Resources' generating assets are categorized as follows:

Wind Assets

- At
December 31, 2009, NextEra Energy Resources had ownership interests in wind
plants with a combined capacity of approximately 7,544 mw (net ownership), of
which approximately 75% have long-term contracts with utilities and power
marketers, predominantly under fixed-price agreements with expiration dates
ranging from 2011 to 2034.  The expected output of the remaining 25%
is substantially hedged through 2011 and partially hedged through 2016 against
changes in commodity prices.  NextEra Energy Resources operates
substantially all of these wind facilities.  Approximately 92% of
NextEra Energy Resources' net ownership in wind facilities has received exempt
wholesale generator status as defined under the Holding Company
Act.  Essentially all of the remaining facilities have qualifying
facility status under PURPA.  NextEra Energy Resources' wind
facilities are located in 17 states and Canada.  NextEra Energy
Resources expects to add approximately 1,000 mw of new wind generation in
2010.


Contracted Assets

- At
December 31, 2009, NextEra Energy Resources had 3,533 mw of non-wind
contracted assets.  The contracted category includes all projects,
other than wind, with contracts for substantially all of their
output.  Essentially all of these contracted assets were under power
sales contracts with utilities, with contract expiration dates ranging from 2011
to 2033 and have firm fuel and transportation agreements with expiration dates
ranging from December 2010 to 2022.  See
Note 14 - Contracts.  Approximately 1,825 mw of this
capacity is natural gas-fired generation.  The remaining 1,708 mw uses
a variety of fuels and technologies such as nuclear, oil, solar, coal and
petroleum coke.  As of December 31, 2009, approximately 93% of
NextEra Energy Resources' contracted generating capacity is from power plants
that have received exempt wholesale generator status under the Holding Company
Act, while the remaining 7% has qualifying facility status under
PURPA.

Merchant Assets

- At
December 31, 2009, NextEra Energy Resources' portfolio of merchant assets
includes 7,071 mw of owned nuclear, natural gas, oil and hydro generation, of
which 3,772 mw is located in the Northeast region, 2,792 mw in the ERCOT region
and 507 mw in the West region.  The merchant assets include 1,017 mw
of peak generating facilities.  Merchant assets are plants that do not
have long-term power sales agreements to sell their output and therefore require
active marketing and hedging.  Approximately 75% (based on net mw
capability) of the natural gas fueled merchant assets have natural gas supply
agreements or a combination of natural gas supply and transportation agreements
to provide for on-peak natural gas requirements.  In mid-2010, two
natural gas fired plants, located in California and Pennsylvania, with a
combined net generating capacity of approximately 1,250 mw, will move to the
contracted assets category when their respective long-term power sales
agreements become effective.  See Note 14 -
Contracts.  Derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures
and forwards) are used to lock in pricing and manage the commodity price risk
inherent in power sales and fuel purchases.  Managing market risk
through these instruments introduces other types of risk, primarily counterparty
and operational risks.  See Energy Marketing and Trading
below.

Nuclear
Operations.

NextEra Energy Resources wholly owns, or has
undivided interests in, three nuclear power plants with a total net generating
capability of 2,552 mw.  NextEra Energy Resources is responsible for
all plant operations and the ultimate decommissioning of the plants, the cost of
which is shared on a pro-rata basis by the joint owners for the jointly owned
plants.  See estimated decommissioning cost data in
Note 1 - Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of
Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs - NextEra Energy
Resources.  The nuclear units are periodically removed from service to
accommodate normal refueling and maintenance outages, repairs and certain other
modifications.  The following table summarizes certain information

NextEra
Energy Resources is in the process of adding approximately 80 mw of capacity at
each of its existing nuclear units at Point Beach during the scheduled refueling
outages in the fall of 2011 for Unit No. 1 and the spring of 2011 for Unit
No. 2.  The construction costs relating to the capacity additions
yet to be incurred as of December 31, 2009 are included in estimated
planned capital expenditures set forth in Capital Expenditures
above.  See Note 14 - Commitments.


NextEra
Energy Resources' nuclear facilities have several contracts for the supply,
conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel with expiration dates
ranging from March 2010 to 2022.  See Note 14 -
Contracts.  Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the DOE is responsible
for the development of a repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and
high-level radioactive waste.  As required by the Nuclear Waste Policy
Act, subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources are parties to contracts with the
DOE to provide for disposal of spent nuclear fuel from its Seabrook, Duane
Arnold and Point Beach nuclear units.  The DOE was required to
construct permanent disposal facilities and take title to and provide
transportation and disposal for spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998 for
a specified fee based on current generation from nuclear power
plants.  The total cumulative amount of such fees paid to the U.S.
Government's nuclear waste fund for Seabrook, Duane Arnold and Point Beach,
including amounts paid by all joint owners, since the start of the plants'
operations through December 31, 2009, is approximately $514 million, of
which NextEra Energy Resources has paid approximately $83 million since the date
of the plants' acquisition.  The DOE did not meet its statutory
obligation for disposal of spent nuclear fuel under the Nuclear Waste Policy
Act.  In 2009, certain subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources and
certain nuclear plant joint owners signed the spent fuel settlement agreement
with the U.S. Government agreeing to dismiss with prejudice lawsuits filed
against the U.S. Government seeking damages caused by the DOE's failure to
dispose of spent nuclear fuel from the Seabrook, Duane Arnold and Point Beach
nuclear plants.  The spent fuel settlement agreement permits NextEra
Energy Resources to make annual filings to recover certain spent fuel storage
costs incurred by NextEra Energy Resources which will be payable by the U.S.
Government on an annual basis.  Through December 31, 2009,
NextEra Energy Resources has collected approximately $42 million of the amount
due from the U.S. Government pursuant to the spent fuel settlement agreement and
has paid approximately $18 million to the joint owners of Duane Arnold and
Seabrook.  An additional payment from the U.S. Government of
approximately $12 million relating to costs incurred in 2008 is
pending.  NextEra Energy Resources plans to file a claim for spent
fuel storage costs incurred during 2009 by April 2010.  NextEra Energy
Resources will continue to pay fees to the U.S. Government's nuclear waste
fund.  The DOE filed a license application for a permanent disposal
facility for spent nuclear fuel with the NRC in 2008, and a licensing proceeding
is ongoing before the NRC.  However, it is uncertain when a permanent
disposal facility will be constructed and when it would be ready to begin
receiving spent nuclear fuel shipments.  All of NextEra Energy
Resources' nuclear facilities use both on-site storage pools and dry storage
casks to store spent nuclear fuel generated by these facilities, which should
allow NextEra Energy Resources to store spent nuclear fuel at these facilities
through license expiration.

Energy Marketing and
Trading.

PMI, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources, buys
and sells wholesale energy commodities, such as natural gas, oil and
electricity.  Its primary role is to manage the commodity risk of
NextEra Energy Resources' portfolio.  PMI sells the output from
NextEra Energy Resources' plants that has not been sold under long-term
contracts.  PMI procures natural gas and oil for NextEra Energy
Resources' use in power generation, as well as substantially all of the
electricity needs for NextEra Energy Resources' retail operations conducted
primarily in Texas, which at December 31, 2009 served approximately 1,010
mw of peak load to approximately 148,000 customers.  PMI uses
derivative instruments such as swaps, options, futures and forwards to manage
the risk associated with fluctuating commodity prices and to optimize the value
of NextEra Energy Resources' power generation assets.  PMI also
provides full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to
distribution utilities in certain markets and engages in power and gas marketing
and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price
movements.  Full energy and capacity requirements services include
load-following services, which require the supplier of energy to vary the
quantity delivered based on the load demand needs of the customer, as well as
various ancillary services.  At December 31, 2009, PMI provided
full energy and capacity requirements services totaling approximately 5,000 mw
of peak load in the NEPOOL, PJM, ERCOT and MISO markets.  The results
of PMI's activities are included in NextEra Energy Resources' operating
results.  See Management's Discussion - Energy Marketing and Trading
and Market Risk Sensitivity, Note 1 - Energy Trading and
Note 3.

Regulation.

At
December 31, 2009, NextEra Energy Resources had ownership interests in
operating independent power projects that have received exempt wholesale
generator status as defined under the Holding Company Act, which represent
approximately 95% of NextEra Energy Resources' net generating
capacity.  Exempt wholesale generators own or operate a facility
exclusively to sell electricity to wholesale customers.  They are
barred from selling electricity directly to retail customers.  NextEra
Energy Resources' exempt wholesale generators produce electricity from wind,
hydropower, fossil fuels and nuclear facilities.  Essentially all of
the remaining 5% of NextEra Energy Resources' net generating capacity has
qualifying facility status under PURPA.  NextEra Energy Resources'
qualifying facilities generate electricity from wind, solar, fossil fuels or
waste coal.  Qualifying facility status exempts the projects from,
among other things, many of the provisions of the Federal Power Act, as well as
state laws and regulations relating to rates and financial or organizational
regulation of electric utilities.  While projects with qualifying
facility and/or exempt wholesale generator status are exempt from various
restrictions, each project must still comply with other federal, state and local
laws, including, but not limited to, those regarding siting, construction,
operation, licensing, pollution abatement and other environmental
laws.

Each of
the markets in which NextEra Energy Resources operates is subject to regulation
and specific rules.  NextEra Energy Resources continues to evaluate
regional market redesigns of existing operating rules for the integration of
renewable energy resources and for the purchase and sale of energy
commodities.  ERCOT is scheduled to implement a locational marginal
price (LMP) market design (a market-pricing approach used to manage the
efficient use of the transmission system when congestion occurs on the
electricity grid) in late 2010.  The final ERCOT market design has not
yet been determined, therefore, NextEra Energy Resources is currently unable to
determine the effects, if any, on its business resulting from implementation of
the final market design.  In the second quarter of 2009, California
implemented a LMP market design, which did not have a material effect on NextEra
Energy Resources' business.  Additionally, certain NextEra Energy
Resources facilities are subject to the NERC’s mandatory reliability standards,
and its nuclear facilities are subject to the jurisdiction of the
NRC.


Competition.

Competitive
wholesale markets in the United States continue to evolve and vary among and
within geographic regions.  Revenues from electricity sales in these
markets vary based on the prices obtainable for energy, capacity and other
ancillary services.  Some of the factors affecting success in these
markets include the ability to operate generating assets efficiently and
reliably, the price and supply of fuel, transmission constraints, wind, solar
and hydro resources (weather conditions), competition from regulated utilities
and new sources of generation, effective risk management, demand growth,
environmental requirements and exposure to legal and regulatory
changes.

Expanded
competition in a frequently changing regulatory environment presents both
opportunities and risks for NextEra Energy Resources.  Opportunities
exist for the selective acquisition of generation assets and for the
construction and operation of efficient plants that can sell power in
competitive markets.  NextEra Energy Resources seeks to reduce its
market risk by having a diversified portfolio by fuel type and location, as well
as by contracting for the future sale of a significant amount of the electricity
output of its plants.

Environmental.

NextEra
Energy Resources is subject to environmental laws and regulations and is
affected by some of the emerging issues included in the Environmental Matters
section.

During
2009, NextEra Energy Resources spent approximately $4 million on capital
additions to comply with existing environmental laws and
regulations.  NextEra Energy Resources' capital expenditures to comply
with existing environmental laws and regulations are estimated to be $14 million
for 2010 through 2012, including approximately $6 million in 2010, and are
included in estimated planned capital expenditures set forth in General
above.

Employees.

NextEra
Energy Resources and its subsidiaries had approximately 4,570 employees at
December 31, 2009.  Subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources have
collective bargaining agreements with various unions which are summarized in the
table below.

OTHER
FPL GROUP OPERATIONS

FPL
Group's Corporate and Other segment represents other business activities,
primarily FPL FiberNet and Lone Star Transmission, that are not separately
reportable.  See Note 15.

FPL
FiberNet.

FPL FiberNet, a wholly-owned subsidiary of FPL Group
Capital, was formed in 2000 to enhance the value of FPL Group's fiber-optic
network assets that were originally built to support FPL
operations.  Accordingly, in 2000, FPL's existing fiber-optic lines
were transferred to FPL FiberNet.  FPL FiberNet is a limited liability
company organized under the laws of Delaware.  FPL FiberNet leases
wholesale fiber-optic network capacity and dark fiber to FPL and other
customers, primarily telephone, wireless carriers, internet and other
telecommunications companies.  FPL FiberNet's primary business focus
is the Florida metropolitan (metro) market.  Metro networks cover
Miami, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, Tampa, St. Petersburg, Orlando and
Jacksonville.  FPL FiberNet also has a long-haul network within
Florida that leases bandwidth at wholesale rates.  At
December 31, 2009, FPL FiberNet's network consisted of approximately 2,950
route miles, which interconnect major cities throughout Florida.

At
December 31, 2009, FPL Group's investment in FPL FiberNet totaled
approximately $164 million.  FPL FiberNet invested approximately $54
million during 2009 and plans to invest a total of approximately $110 million
over the next five years primarily to meet customers' specific requirements
under contract.


Lone Star
Transmission.

In 2008, the Public Utility Commission of Texas
(PUCT) approved a $4.9 billion transmission grid improvement program that would
add approximately 2,300 miles of 345 kv lines to deliver wind power from the
Competitive Renewable Energy Zones (CREZ) in west Texas and the Texas panhandle
to the Dallas/Fort Worth area and other population centers in
Texas.  In May 2009, Lone Star Transmission, LLC (Lone Star), an
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of FPL Group Capital, was, under the PUCT's
Transmission Service Provider (TSP) Order, allocated $565 million
in transmission projects by the PUCT under the CREZ
program.  Lone Star's CREZ project would include constructing and
operating 250 miles of 345 kv transmission lines in Texas.  Lone Star
intends to file a certificate of convenience and need (CCN) with the PUCT by
mid-2010, which will begin the process of both establishing Lone Star as a
regulated transmission provider in Texas and obtaining approval to begin
construction of Lone Star's CREZ project.  An order from the PUCT
regarding Lone Star's CCN application is expected later in 2010.  In
January 2010, the TSP order was reversed and remanded back to the PUCT to
consider certain issues raised in an appeal of the TSP order.  The
Lone Star CREZ transmission project is subject to, among other things, issuance
of the revised TSP order, receipt, and possible petition for reconsideration and
appeal, of all applicable ERCOT and PUCT approvals.  Once all required
approvals are obtained, Lone Star expects to commence construction on its CREZ
transmission project.  Due to the contingencies discussed above, the
estimated costs associated with this project are not included in the capital
expenditures table in Note 14 - Commitments.

ENVIRONMENTAL
MATTERS

Federal,
state and local environmental laws and regulations cover air and water quality,
land use, power plant and transmission line siting, EMF from power lines and
substations, oil discharge from transformers, lead paint, asbestos, noise and
aesthetics, solid waste, natural resources, wildlife mortality and other
environmental matters.  Compliance with these laws and regulations
increases the cost of electric service by requiring, among other things, changes
in the design and operation of existing facilities and changes or delays in the
location, design, construction and operation of new
facilities.  Environmental laws and regulations are subject to
change.  The following is a discussion of emerging federal and state
initiatives and rules that could potentially affect FPL Group and its
subsidiaries, including FPL and NextEra Energy Resources.

Climate Change

- The U.S.
Congress and certain states and regions are considering several legislative and
regulatory proposals that would establish new regulatory requirements and
reduction targets for GHG emissions.  In June 2009, the U.S. House of
Representatives passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009
(ACESA) to encourage the development of clean energy sources and reduce GHG
emissions.  ACESA would establish, among other things, provisions for
federal renewable energy standards for electric suppliers and a national cap and
trade program to reduce GHG emissions.  The U.S. Senate is considering
similar proposals. It is not clear whether and when this or similar legislation
may be enacted.  The economic and operational impact of this or any
similar legislation on FPL Group and FPL depends on a variety of factors,
including, but not limited to, the allowed emissions, whether the permitted
emissions will be allocated or auctioned, the cost to reduce emissions or buy
allowances in the marketplace, and the availability of offsets and mitigating
factors to moderate the costs of compliance.  If and until legislation
is enacted and implementing regulations are adopted, the economic and
operational impact (either positive or negative) on FPL Group and FPL cannot be
determined but could be material.

Meanwhile,
the EPA is implementing regulatory action under the Clean Air Act to address
climate change.  In April 2009, the EPA released a proposed
endangerment finding under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act that the current
and projected concentrations of GHG in the atmosphere threaten the public health
and welfare of current and future generations, and issued a final finding in
December 2009.  The final finding noted that, among other things,
climate change is expected to result in an increase in electricity production,
especially supply for peak demand, a potentially adverse impact on hydropower
resources as well as the potential risk of serious adverse effects on energy
infrastructure from extreme weather events.  In September 2009, the
EPA and the U.S. Department of Transportation issued a proposed rule under the
Clean Air Act to regulate GHG emissions from light duty vehicles.  The
EPA's proposed rule is expected to be finalized in March 2010, which will then
trigger certain permitting requirements under the Clean Air Act for any new or
modified stationary sources of GHG, including power plants, that exceed certain
GHG emissions levels.  Also, in September 2009, the EPA released a
proposed rule under the Clean Air Act to tailor requirements for GHG emissions
which would increase applicability thresholds for major sources from 100 or 250
tons per year (tpy) to 25,000 tpy.  New facilities emitting 25,000 tpy
or more of GHG and modifications to existing facilities resulting in an increase
of GHG emissions in the range of 10,000 - 25,000 tpy or more will have to meet
additional requirements.  In September 2009, the EPA issued a final
rule for mandatory reporting of GHG emissions from facilities with emissions of
25,000 tpy or more, which includes all of FPL's and NextEra Energy Resources'
fossil plants.  Affected facilities must begin collecting data in
January 2010 and the first emissions report is due on March 31, 2011 for
the 2010 period.

Based on
current reference data available from government sources, FPL Group is among the
lowest emitters, among electric generators, of GHG in the United States measured
by its rate of emissions expressed as pounds of CO


per
megawatt-hour (mwh) of generation.  However, the legislative and
regulatory proposals have differing methods of implementation and the impact on
FPL's and NextEra Energy Resources' generating units and/or the financial impact
(either positive or negative) to FPL Group and FPL could be material, depending
on the eventual structure of any legislation enacted or specific implementation
rules adopted.


In
anticipation of the potential for further imposition of GHG emission limits on
the electric industry in the future, FPL Group has taken a leadership role in
the debate of climate change regulation and is involved in several climate
change initiatives, including, but not limited to, the following:

·

voluntary
      reporting of its GHG emissions and climate change strategy through the
      Carbon Disclosure Project (an investor-led initiative to identify climate
      change impacts on publicly-traded
companies);

·

participation
      in the U.S. Climate Action Partnership (an alliance made up of a diverse
      group of U.S.-based businesses and environmental organizations, which in
      January 2009 issued the Blueprint for Legislative Action, a set of
      legislative principles and recommendations to address global climate
      change and the reduction of GHG
emissions);

·

participation
      in the Clinton Global Initiative (an organization which seeks to foster
      shared commitment by individuals, businesses and governments to confront
      major world issues and achieve real
change);

·

participated
      in the EPA's Climate Leaders Program to reduce GHG intensity in the United
      States 18% by 2012, including reporting of emissions data
      annually.  During 2008, FPL Group met its commitment to achieve
      a 2008 target emissions rate reduction of 18% below a 2001 baseline
      emission rate measured in pounds per
mwh;

·

supporting
      Edison Electric Institute's climate change framework, which supports the
      concept of mandatory legislation capping carbon emissions economy wide and
      recommends, among other things, an 80% reduction of carbon emissions from
      current levels by 2050;

·

participation
      in various groups, including working with the Governor of Florida on the
      Governor's Action Team on Energy and Climate Change, the FDEP, the Florida
      Energy and Climate Commission and the FPSC in addressing executive orders
      issued in 2007 by the Governor of Florida (see below for additional
      information); and

·

focusing
      on customer energy efficiency and conservation through programs such as
      Energy Smart Florida and EarthEra Renewable Energy
  Trust.

In 2007,
the Governor of Florida issued three executive orders aimed at reducing Florida
GHG emissions and improving Florida's energy efficiency.  The orders
state, among other things, that Florida utilities will be required to reduce
emissions to 2000 levels by 2017; to 1990 levels by 2025; and to 20% of 1990
levels by 2050, and that the FPSC should begin the process of adopting a
renewable portfolio standard that would require utilities to produce at least
20% of their energy from renewable sources, with an emphasis on wind and solar
energy.  The FPSC submitted a draft rule in January 2009 which was not
adopted by the legislature.  The FDEP is currently evaluating various
options regarding GHG emissions reductions.  Any rule issued by FDEP
or FPSC would require approval by the legislature.  The impact of any
future legislation on FPL and FPL Group cannot be determined at this
time.

NextEra
Energy Resources' plants operate in many states and regions that have developed
or are in the process of developing legislation to reduce GHG emissions,
including, but not limited to, the following:

·

Renewable
      portfolio standards (RPS), currently in place in 31 states, require
      electricity providers in the state to meet a certain percentage of their
      retail sales with energy from renewable sources.  These
      standards vary by state, but the majority include requirements to meet 10%
      to 25% of the electricity providers' retail sales with energy from
      renewable sources by 2025.

·

The
      Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is a GHG reduction initiative
      whereby ten Northeast and Mid-Atlantic member states have established a
      cap and trade program for covered electric generating units in
      Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
      Vermont, Maryland, Massachusetts and Rhode Island.  RGGI members
      have agreed to stabilize power plant CO


emissions at 2009 levels through the end of 2014 and to further reduce the
      sector's emissions another 10% by the end of 2018.  The RGGI GHG
      reduction requirements will affect 12 NextEra Energy Resources' fossil
      electric generating units, requiring those electric generating units to
      reduce emissions or to acquire CO


allowances for emissions of CO


beginning in 2009.  All RGGI states have enacted legislation and
      regulations.  Based on NextEra Energy Resources' clean
      generating portfolio in the RGGI marketplace, NextEra Energy Resources
      experienced a positive impact on earnings in 2009 and expects that the
      requirements will have a positive overall impact on NextEra Energy
      Resources' earnings in 2010.

·

The
      Western Climate Initiative is a GHG reduction initiative with a goal of
      reducing CO


emissions by 15% below 2005 levels by 2020 for participants (Arizona,
      California, Oregon, Montana, New Mexico, Washington and Utah, as well as
      British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec,
  Canada).

·

California
      Greenhouse Gas Regulation - California has enacted legislation to reduce
      GHG emissions in the state to 1990 emissions levels by
      2020.  Pursuant to the legislation, the California Air Resources
      Board (CARB) must implement multi-sector GHG reduction measures by January
      1, 2012.  The CARB has released a proposed GHG program which
      includes a cap and trade program and administrative fee on GHG emissions
      sources but excludes certain details.  The CARB anticipates
      supplementing its proposal in the spring of 2010 and finalizing it in
      November 2010.


·

The
      Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord (MGGRA) is an initiative to
      reduce GHG emissions through the establishment of targets for GHG
      reductions and the development of a cap and trade
      program.  Participants in MGGRA are Illinois, Iowa, Kansas,
      Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Manitoba, Canada.  MGGRA has
      proposed a multi-sector program that, if implemented, will initially be
      focused on the electricity generation and imports, industrial combustion
      and industrial processes sectors.  Currently, NextEra Energy
      Resources does not have any fossil-fired generation in the MGGRA
      region.

Except
as discussed above regarding RPS and the RGGI, the final requirements to be
enacted in connection with these initiatives are uncertain and the financial and
operational impacts on FPL Group cannot be determined at this
time.  However, NextEra Energy Resources' portfolio in these regions
is heavily weighted toward non-CO


emitting
and low CO


emitting generation sources (wind, hydro, solar, nuclear and natural
gas).

Clean Air Act Mercury/Nickel
Rule

- During 2005, the EPA determined that new data indicated that
nickel emissions from oil-fired units and mercury emissions from coal-fired
units should not be regulated under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act, which sets
Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards (MACT), and as a result the EPA
published a final rule delisting nickel and mercury from the requirements of
regulation under Section 112.  In lieu of regulation under Section
112, the EPA issued a final rule (Clean Air Mercury Rule) to regulate mercury
emissions from coal-fired electric utility steam generating units under Section
111 of the Clean Air Act.  The mercury and nickel delisting rule, as
well as the Clean Air Mercury Rule, were challenged by various states and
environmental groups.  In 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia (DC Circuit) vacated both the EPA's mercury and nickel
delisting rule and the Clean Air Mercury Rule, requiring the EPA to proceed with
rulemaking under Section 112.  In November 2009, the EPA issued a
final information collection request (ICR) for hazardous air pollutants for coal
and oil-fired electric generating units which requires extensive fuel and
emissions stack testing from oil and gas facilities throughout the U.S. which
must be completed by August 2010.  The ICR lists certain FPL oil-fired
units, Scherer Unit No. 4, SJRPP Units Nos. 1 and 2, certain
coal-fired units from which FPL purchases power and three of NextEra Energy
Resources' oil-fired units in Maine for stack testing.  Depending upon
the final outcome of the EPA's rulemaking, it is possible that these units may
be required to add additional pollution control equipment.

Clean Air Interstate Rule
(CAIR)

- In 2005, the EPA published a final rule that requires SO


and NOx
emissions reductions from electric generating units in 28 states, where the
emissions from electric generating units are deemed to be transported to
downwind states, allegedly resulting in fine particulate (PM 2.5) and ozone
non-attainment areas.  In July 2008, the DC Circuit issued an opinion
vacating the CAIR and remanded the rule to the EPA for further
rulemaking.  In September 2008, the EPA and three other parties
petitioned for rehearing of that order.  In December 2008, the DC
Circuit remanded the CAIR back to the EPA for further rulemaking without
vacating the rule.  Because the DC Circuit chose not to vacate the
rule, FPL Group and FPL were required to begin complying with the current
version of the CAIR on January 1, 2009 and must continue to comply until
the EPA rewrites the rule; a proposed rule is expected to be published in
mid-2010.  The impact of complying with the current version of the
CAIR has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on the
financial statements of FPL Group and FPL.

FPL
Group and others have urged the EPA to move forward with separate rulemaking
that removes the NOx fuel adjustment factors deemed unlawful by the
court.  FPL Group contends that the NOx fuel adjustment factors are
used to unfairly skew the allocation of emission allowances to states with
relatively higher emissions.

Clean Air Visibility Rule

-
In 2005, the EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule to address regional haze
in areas which include certain national park and wilderness areas through the
installation of BART for electric generating units.  BART eligible
units include those built between 1962 and 1977 that have the potential to emit
more than 250 tons of visibility-impairing pollution per year.  The
rule requires states to complete BART determinations and allows for a five-year
period to implement pollution controls.  The impact of the final BART
requirements of the Clean Air Visibility Rule on FPL's Turkey Point Fossil Units
Nos. 1 and 2 and on one of NextEra Energy Resources' units located in Maine
are not expected to be material to the financial statements of FPL Group or
FPL.

In 2007,
the FDEP began the process to expand the number of units covered under the
"Reasonable Further Progress" provision of the Clean Air Visibility Rule in an
effort to reduce emissions of SO


in areas
which include certain national park and wilderness areas.  The
provision requires that control measures be in place by 2017.  Eight
of FPL's generating facilities are affected under the Reasonable Further
Progress provision (Manatee Units Nos. 1 and 2, Port Everglades Units
Nos. 3 and 4, Turkey Point Fossil Units Nos. 1 and 2 and SJRPP Units
Nos. 1 and 2).  While the final requirements of the Reasonable Further
Progress provision are uncertain, it is possible that these units may be
required to switch fuels, install additional emission controls or make
adjustments to existing controls to meet the provision's emissions
requirements.


Clean Water Act Section
316(b)

- In 2004, the EPA issued a rule under Section 316(b) of the Clean
Water Act to address the location, design, construction and capacity of intake
structures at existing power plants with once-through cooling water
systems.  The rule would have required FPL Group to demonstrate that
it had met or would meet new impingement mortality (the loss of organisms
against screens and other exclusion devices) and/or entrainment (the loss of
organisms by passing through the cooling water system) reductions by complying
with one of several alternatives, including the use of technology and/or
operational measures.  In 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit ruled on a challenge to the rule by a number of environmental
groups and six northeastern states.  In its ruling, the court
eliminated several of the compliance alternatives, including the use of a
"cost-benefit test" and restoration measures, from consideration and remanded
the rule to the EPA for further rulemaking.  As a result of the 2007
court decision, the EPA has suspended its rule under Section 316(b) of the Clean
Water Act and directed its jurisdictions to address Section 316(b) compliance
based on best professional judgment when issuing and renewing
permits.  In April 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the use of
a cost-benefit test is an acceptable alternative under Section 316(b) of the
Clean Water Act for determining the best technology available for minimizing
adverse environmental impacts from the use of large cooling water intake
systems.  The EPA is working on new rulemaking which is expected to be
published in the second quarter of 2010.  Depending upon the final
outcome of the litigation, additional rulemaking by the EPA could impact eight
of FPL's generating facilities (Cape Canaveral, Cutler, Fort Myers, Lauderdale,
Port Everglades, Sanford, Riviera and St. Lucie) and three NextEra Energy
Resources plants (Seabrook, Point Beach and an oil-fired plant in
Maine).

Revisions to the National Ambient
Air Quality Standards for Ozone

- In 2008, the EPA issued a final rule
establishing a new standard for ground-level ozone at 75 parts per billion
(ppb).  After reconsideration, in January 2010, the EPA issued a
proposed revision to the national ambient air quality standards for ground-level
ozone by revising the 2008 primary standard to a more restrictive primary
standard of between 60 ppb and 70 ppb.  It is anticipated that the EPA
will issue a final rule by August 2010 which will require states to (i) identify
areas which will be designated as non-attainment for ground-level ozone within
120 days of the final rule, (ii) develop plans to meet the attainment standard
by 2013 and (iii) begin meeting the attainment standard between 2014 and 2031
based on non-attainment severity.  Generating facilities located in
areas designated as non-attainment may be required to add additional pollution
control equipment.  A review of recent ozone monitoring data indicates
that some or all of FPL's generating facilities may be located in or affected by
non-attainment areas, or areas projected to be in non-attainment depending on
the primary standard adopted.

Item
1A.  Risk Factors

Risks
Relating to FPL Group's and FPL's Business

FPL
Group and FPL are subject to complex laws and regulations and to changes in laws
and regulations as well as changing governmental policies and regulatory
actions.  FPL holds franchise agreements with local municipalities and
counties, and must renegotiate expiring agreements.  These factors may
have a negative impact on the business and results of operations of FPL Group
and FPL.

·

FPL
      Group and FPL are subject to complex laws and regulations, and to changes
      in laws or regulations, with respect to, among other things, allowed rates
      of return, industry and rate structure, operation of nuclear power
      facilities, construction and operation of generation facilities,
      construction and operation of transmission and distribution facilities,
      acquisition, disposal, depreciation and amortization of assets and
      facilities, recovery of fuel, purchased power and environmental costs,
      decommissioning costs, ROE and equity ratio limits, transmission
      reliability and present or prospective wholesale and retail
      competition.  This substantial and complex framework exposes FPL
      Group and FPL to increased compliance costs and potentially significant
      monetary penalties for non-compliance.  The FPSC has the
      authority to disallow recovery by FPL of any and all costs that it
      considers excessive or imprudently incurred.  The regulatory
      process generally restricts FPL's ability to grow earnings and does not
      provide any assurance as to achievement of earnings
  levels.

·

FPL
      Group and FPL also are subject to extensive federal, state and local
      environmental statutes, rules and regulations, as well as the effect of
      changes in or additions to applicable statutes, rules and regulations that
      relate to, or in the future may relate to, for example, air quality, water
      quality, climate change, GHG emissions, CO


emissions, radioactive emissions, waste management, marine and wildlife
      mortality, natural resources, health, safety and renewable portfolio
      standards that could, among other things, restrict or limit the output of
      certain facilities or the use of certain fuels required for the production
      of electricity and/or require additional pollution control equipment and
      otherwise increase costs.  There are significant capital,
      operating and other costs associated with compliance with these
      environmental statutes, rules and regulations, and those costs could be
      even more significant in the future.  Violations of certain of
      these statutes, rules and regulations could expose FPL Group and FPL to
      third-party disputes and potentially significant monetary penalties for
      non-compliance.

·

FPL
      Group and FPL operate in a changing market environment influenced by
      various legislative and regulatory initiatives regarding regulation,
      deregulation or restructuring of the energy industry, including, for
      example, deregulation or restructuring of the production and sale of
      electricity, as well as increased focus on renewable and clean energy
      sources and reduction of CO


emissions and other GHG emissions.  FPL Group and its
      subsidiaries will need to adapt to these changes and may face increasing
      costs and competitive pressure in doing
so.

·

FPL
      Group's and FPL's results of operations could be affected by FPL's ability
      to negotiate or renegotiate franchise agreements with municipalities and
      counties in Florida.

The
operation and maintenance of power generation, transmission and distribution
facilities involve significant risks that could adversely affect the results of
operations and financial condition of FPL Group and FPL.

·

The
      operation and maintenance of power generation, transmission and
      distribution facilities involve many risks, including, for example, start
      up risks, breakdown or failure of equipment, transmission and distribution
      lines or pipelines and the availability of replacement equipment, the
      inability to properly manage or mitigate known equipment defects
      throughout FPL Group's and FPL's generation fleets and transmission and
      distribution systems, use of new or unproven technology, the dependence on
      a specific fuel source, failures in the supply or transportation of fuel,
      the impact of unusual or adverse weather conditions (including natural
      disasters such as hurricanes, floods and droughts), and performance below
      expected or contracted levels of output or efficiency.  This
      could result in lost revenues and/or increased expenses, including, for
      example, lost revenues due to prolonged outages and increased expenses due
      to monetary penalties or fines, replacement equipment costs or an
      obligation to purchase or generate replacement power at potentially higher
      prices to meet contractual obligations.  Insurance, warranties
      or performance guarantees may not cover any or all of the lost revenues or
      increased expenses.  Breakdown or failure of an operating
      facility of NextEra Energy Resources may, for example, prevent the
      facility from performing under applicable power sales agreements which, in
      certain situations, could result in termination of the agreement or
      subject NextEra Energy Resources to incurring a liability for liquidated
      damages.

The
operation and maintenance of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks,
including environmental, health, regulatory, terrorism and financial risks, that
could result in fines or the closure of nuclear units owned by FPL or NextEra
Energy Resources, and which may present potential exposures in excess of
insurance coverage.


·

FPL
      and NextEra Energy Resources own, or hold undivided interests in, nuclear
      generation facilities in four states.  These nuclear facilities
      are subject to environmental, health and financial risks such as on-site
      storage of spent nuclear fuel, the ability to dispose of spent nuclear
      fuel, the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning,
      potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities,
      and the threat of a possible terrorist attack.  Although FPL and
      NextEra Energy Resources maintain decommissioning funds and external
      insurance coverage to minimize the financial exposure to these risks, it
      is possible that the cost of decommissioning the facilities could exceed
      the amount available in the decommissioning funds, and that liability and
      property damages could exceed the amount of insurance
      coverage.

·

The
      NRC has broad authority to impose licensing and safety-related
      requirements for the construction and operation and maintenance of nuclear
      generation facilities.  In the event of non-compliance, the NRC
      has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending
      upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is
      achieved.  NRC orders or new regulations related to increased
      security measures and any future safety requirements promulgated by the
      NRC could require FPL and NextEra Energy Resources to incur substantial
      operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants.  In
      addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur at an FPL or NextEra
      Energy Resources plant, it could result in substantial costs.  A
      major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the
      NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic
      nuclear unit.

·

In
      addition, potential terrorist threats and increased public scrutiny of
      utilities could result in increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs
      which are difficult or impossible to
predict.

The
construction of, and capital improvements to, power generation and transmission
facilities involve substantial risks.  Should construction or capital
improvement efforts be unsuccessful or delayed, the results of operations and
financial condition of FPL Group and FPL could be adversely
affected.

·

The
      ability of FPL Group and FPL to complete construction of, and capital
      improvement projects for, their power generation and transmission
      facilities on schedule and within budget are contingent upon many
      variables that could delay completion, increase costs or otherwise
      adversely affect operational and financial results, including, for
      example, limitations related to transmission interconnection issues,
      escalating costs for materials and labor and environmental compliance,
      delays with respect to permits and other approvals, and disputes involving
      third parties, and are subject to substantial risks.  Should any
      such efforts be unsuccessful or delayed, FPL Group and FPL could be
      subject to additional costs, termination payments under committed
      contracts, loss of tax credits and/or the write-off of their investment in
      the project or improvement.

The
use of derivative contracts by FPL Group and FPL in the normal course of
business could result in financial losses or the payment of margin cash
collateral that could adversely impact the results of operations or cash flows
of FPL Group and FPL.

·

FPL
      Group and FPL use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures
      and forwards, some of which are traded in the over-the-counter markets or
      on exchanges, to manage their commodity and financial market risks, and
      for FPL Group to engage in trading and marketing
      activities.  FPL Group could recognize financial losses as a
      result of volatility in the market values of these derivative instruments,
      or if a counterparty fails to perform or make payments under these
      derivative instruments and could suffer a reduction in operating cash
      flows as a result of the requirement to post margin cash
      collateral.  In the absence of actively quoted market prices and
      pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these
      derivative instruments involves management's judgment or use of
      estimates.  As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions
      or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair
      value of these derivative instruments.  In addition, FPL's use
      of such instruments could be subject to prudence challenges and, if found
      imprudent, cost recovery could be disallowed by the
  FPSC.

·

FPL
      Group provides full energy and capacity requirement services, which
      include load-following services and various ancillary services, primarily
      to distribution utilities to satisfy all or a portion of such utilities'
      power supply obligations to their customers.  The supply costs
      for these transactions may be affected by a number of factors, including
      by events that may occur after FPL Group has committed to supply power,
      such as weather conditions, fluctuating prices for energy and ancillary
      services, and the ability of the distribution utilities’ customers to
      elect to receive service from competing suppliers.  If the
      supply costs are not favorable, FPL Group’s operating costs could increase
      and result in the possibility of reduced earnings or incurring
      losses.

·

FPL
      Group and FPL have hedging procedures and associated risk management tools
      that may not work as planned.  Risk management tools and metrics
      such as daily value at risk, earnings at risk, stop loss limits and
      liquidity guidelines are based on historical price
      movements.  If price movements significantly or persistently
      deviate from historical behavior, the risk management tools may not
      protect against significant losses.  As a result of these and
      other factors, FPL Group and FPL cannot predict with precision the impact
      that risk management decisions may have on financial
    results.


FPL
Group's competitive energy business is subject to risks, many of which are
beyond the control of FPL Group, including, but not limited to, the efficient
development and operation of generating assets, the successful and timely
completion of project restructuring activities, the price and supply of fuel and
equipment, transmission constraints, competition from other generators,
including those using new sources of generation, excess generation capacity and
demand for power, that may reduce revenues, increase costs or otherwise
adversely impact the results of operations and financial condition of FPL
Group.

·

There
      are various risks associated with FPL Group's competitive energy
      business.  In addition to risks discussed elsewhere, risk
      factors specifically affecting NextEra Energy Resources' success in
      competitive wholesale markets include, for example, the ability to
      efficiently develop and operate generating assets, the successful and
      timely completion of project restructuring activities, maintenance of the
      qualifying facility status of certain projects, the price and supply of
      fuel (including transportation) and equipment, transmission constraints,
      the ability to utilize PTCs or qualify for convertible ITCs, competition
      from other and new sources of generation, excess generation capacity and
      shifting demand for power.  There can be significant volatility
      in market prices for fuel, electricity and renewable and other energy
      commodities, and there are other financial, counterparty and market risks
      that are beyond the control of NextEra Energy
      Resources.  NextEra Energy Resources' inability or failure to
      effectively hedge its assets or positions against changes in commodity
      prices, interest rates, counterparty credit risk or other risk measures
      could significantly impair FPL Group's future financial
      results.  A portion of NextEra Energy Resources' power
      generation facilities operate wholly or partially without long-term power
      purchase agreements.  As a result, power from these facilities
      is sold on the spot market or on a short-term contractual basis, which may
      increase the volatility of FPL Group's financial results.  In
      addition, NextEra Energy Resources' business depends upon power
      transmission and natural gas transportation facilities owned and operated
      by others; if transmission or transportation is disrupted or capacity is
      inadequate or unavailable, NextEra Energy Resources' ability to sell and
      deliver its wholesale power or natural gas may be
  limited.

FPL
Group's ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions is
subject to significant risks, including, but not limited to, the effect of
increased competition for acquisitions resulting from the consolidation of the
power industry.

·

FPL
      Group is likely to encounter significant competition for acquisition
      opportunities that may become available as a result of the consolidation
      of the power industry in general.  In addition, FPL Group may be
      unable to identify attractive acquisition opportunities at favorable
      prices and to complete and integrate them successfully and in a timely
      manner.

FPL
Group and FPL participate in markets that are often subject to uncertain
economic conditions, which makes it difficult to estimate growth, future income
and expenditures.

·

FPL
      Group and FPL participate in markets that are susceptible to uncertain
      economic conditions, which complicate estimates of revenue
      growth.  Because components of budgeting and forecasting are
      dependent upon estimates of revenue growth in the markets FPL Group and
      FPL serve, the uncertainty makes estimates of future income and
      expenditures more difficult.  As a result, FPL Group and FPL may
      make significant investments and expenditures but never realize the
      anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect results of
      operations.  The future direction of the overall economy also
      may have a significant effect on the overall performance and financial
      condition of FPL Group and FPL.

Changes
in the number of customer accounts and customer usage in FPL's service area
affect FPL Group's and FPL's results of operations.

·

FPL
      Group's and FPL's results of operations are affected by the change in the
      number of customer accounts in FPL's service area and customer
      usage.  Changes in the number of customer accounts can be
      affected by growth or decline in population.  Changes in the
      number of customer accounts and customer usage can be affected by economic
      factors in Florida and elsewhere, including, for example, job and income
      growth or decline, housing starts and new home prices.  Changes
      in the number of customer accounts and customer usage directly influence
      the demand for electricity and the need, or lack of need, for additional
      power generation and power delivery facilities at
  FPL.

Weather
affects FPL Group's and FPL's results of operations, as can the impact of severe
weather.  Weather conditions directly influence the demand for
electricity and natural gas, affect the price of energy commodities, and can
affect the production of electricity at power generating
facilities.

·

FPL
      Group's and FPL's results of operations are affected by changes in the
      weather.  Weather conditions directly influence the demand for
      electricity and natural gas, affect the price of energy commodities, and
      can affect the production of electricity at power generating facilities,
      including, but not limited to, wind, solar and hydro-powered
      facilities.  FPL Group's and FPL's results of operations can be
      affected by the impact of severe weather which can be destructive, causing
      outages and/or property damage, may affect fuel supply, and could require
      additional costs to be incurred.  At FPL, recovery of these
      costs is subject to FPSC
approval.


FPL
Group and FPL rely on access to capital and credit markets as significant
sources of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash
flows.  Adverse capital and credit market conditions may adversely
affect FPL Group's and FPL's ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and
operate and grow their businesses, and increase the cost of
capital.  Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the financial
markets can also adversely impact the results of operations and financial
condition of FPL Group and FPL, as well as exert downward pressure on the market
price of FPL Group's common stock.

·

Having
      access to the credit and capital markets, at a reasonable cost, is
      necessary for FPL Group and FPL to fund their operations, including their
      capital requirements. Those markets have provided FPL Group and FPL with
      the liquidity to operate and grow their businesses that is not otherwise
      provided from operating cash flows.  Disruptions, uncertainty or
      volatility in those markets can increase FPL Group's and FPL's cost of
      capital.  If FPL Group and FPL are unable to access the credit
      and capital markets on terms that are reasonable, they may have to delay
      raising capital, issue shorter-term securities and/or bear an unfavorable
      cost of capital, which, in turn, could adversely impact their ability to
      grow their businesses, decrease earnings, significantly reduce financial
      flexibility and/or limit FPL Group's ability to sustain its current common
      stock dividend level.

·

The
      market price and trading volume of FPL Group's common stock could be
      subject to significant fluctuations due to, among other things, general
      stock market conditions and changes in market sentiment regarding FPL
      Group and its subsidiaries' operations, business, growth prospects and
      financing strategies.

FPL
Group's, FPL Group Capital's and FPL's inability to maintain their current
credit ratings may adversely affect FPL Group's and FPL's liquidity, limit the
ability of FPL Group and FPL to grow their businesses, and would likely increase
interest costs.  In addition, FPL Group's, FPL Group Capital's or
FPL's credit providers' inability to maintain their current credit ratings, or
to fund their credit commitments, may adversely affect FPL Group's and FPL's
liquidity.

·

The
      inability of FPL Group, FPL Group Capital and FPL to maintain their
      current credit ratings could affect their ability to raise capital or
      obtain credit on favorable terms, which, in turn, could impact FPL Group's
      and FPL's ability to grow their businesses, service indebtedness or repay
      borrowings, and would likely increase their interest
      costs.  Some of the factors that can affect credit ratings are
      cash flows, liquidity, the amount of debt as a component of total
      capitalization, and political, legislative and regulatory
      actions.  FPL Group, FPL Group Capital or FPL cannot assure that
      their current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of
      time or that one or more of its ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn
      entirely by a rating agency.

·

The
      inability of FPL Group's, FPL Group Capital's and FPL's credit providers
      to maintain credit ratings acceptable under various agreements, or to fund
      their credit commitments, could require FPL Group, FPL Group Capital or
      FPL to, among other things, renegotiate requirements in agreements, find
      an alternative credit provider with acceptable credit ratings to meet the
      requirement, or post cash
collateral.

FPL
Group may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to
pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream
dividends or repay funds to FPL Group.

·

FPL
      Group is a holding company and, as such, has no material operations of its
      own.  Substantially all of FPL Group's consolidated assets are
      held by subsidiaries.  FPL Group’s ability to meet its financial
      obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily
      dependent on the subsidiaries’ net income and cash flows, which are
      subject to the risks of their respective businesses, and their ability to
      pay upstream dividends or to repay funds to FPL Group.  The
      subsidiaries have financial obligations, including payment of debt
      service, which they must satisfy before they can fund FPL
      Group.  FPL Group’s subsidiaries are separate legal entities and
      have no obligation to provide FPL Group with funds for its payment
      obligations.  In addition, the dividend-paying ability of some
      of the subsidiaries is limited by contractual restrictions which are
      contained in outstanding financing agreements and which may be included in
      future financing agreements.

Changes
in tax laws, as well as judgments and estimates used in the determination of
tax-related asset and liability amounts, could adversely affect FPL Group's and
FPL's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

·

FPL
      Group's and FPL's provision for income taxes and reporting of tax-related
      assets and liabilities requires significant judgments and the use of
      estimates.  Amounts of tax-related assets and liabilities
      involve judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of
      recognition of income, deductions and tax credits, including estimates for
      potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken
      and the ability to utilize tax benefit carryforwards, such as net
      operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.  Actual income
      taxes could vary significantly from estimated amounts due to the future
      impacts of, among other things, changes in tax laws, regulations and
      interpretations, financial condition and results of operations of FPL
      Group and its subsidiaries, including FPL, as well as the resolution of
      audit issues raised by taxing authorities.  Ultimate resolution
      of income tax matters may result in material adjustments to tax-related
      assets and liabilities which could impact, either positively or
      negatively, FPL Group's and FPL's results of operations, financial
      condition and liquidity.


FPL
Group and FPL are subject to credit and performance risk from third parties
under supply and service contracts.

·

FPL
      Group and FPL rely on contracts with vendors for the supply of equipment,
      materials, fuel and other goods and services required for the construction
      and operation of, and for capital improvements to, their facilities, as
      well as for business operations.  If vendors fail to fulfill their
      contractual obligations, FPL Group and FPL may need to make arrangements
      with other suppliers, which could result in higher costs, untimely
      completion of power generation facilities and other projects, and/or a
      disruption to their operations.

FPL
Group and FPL are subject to costs and other potentially adverse effects of
legal and regulatory proceedings as well as regulatory compliance and changes in
or additions to applicable tax laws, rates or policies, rates of inflation,
accounting standards, securities laws, corporate governance requirements and
labor and employment laws.

·

FPL
      Group and FPL are subject to costs and other potentially adverse effects
      of legal and regulatory proceedings, settlements, investigations and
      claims, as well as regulatory compliance and the effect of new, or changes
      in, tax laws, rates or policies, rates of inflation, accounting standards
      and interpretations, securities laws, corporate governance requirements
      and labor and employment laws.

·

FPL
      and NextEra Energy Resources, as owners and operators of transmission
      systems and/or critical assets within various regions throughout the
      United States, are subject to mandatory reliability standards established
      by the NERC.  Non-compliance with these mandatory reliability
      standards could result in sanctions, including substantial monetary
      penalties.

Threats
of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism, cyber
attacks, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt FPL Group's and
FPL's business may impact the operations of FPL Group and FPL in unpredictable
ways and could adversely affect FPL Group’s and FPL’s results of operations,
financial condition and liquidity.

·

FPL
      Group and FPL are subject to direct and indirect effects of terrorist
      threats and activities, as well as cyber attacks and disruptive activities
      of individuals and/or groups.  Infrastructure facilities and
      systems, such as generation, transmission and distribution facilities and
      information systems, have been identified as potential
      targets.  The effects of these threats and activities could
      affect FPL Group's and FPL's ability to generate, purchase or transmit
      power, could cause delays in FPL Group's and FPL's development and
      construction of new generating facilities, could result in a significant
      slowdown in growth or a decline in the U.S. economy, could delay an
      economic recovery in the United States, and could increase the cost and
      adequacy of security and insurance, which could adversely affect FPL
      Group’s and FPL’s results of operations, financial condition and
      liquidity.  In addition, these types of events could disrupt FPL
      Group’s or FPL’s operations, require significant management attention and
      resources, and could adversely affect FPL Group's and FPL's reputation
      among customers and the public.

The
ability of FPL Group and FPL to obtain insurance and the terms of any available
insurance coverage could be adversely affected by international, national, state
or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition
of insurers.

·

FPL
      Group's and FPL's ability to obtain insurance, and the cost of and
      coverage provided by such insurance, could be adversely affected by
      international, national, state or local events as well as company-specific
      events, as well as the financial condition of
  insurers.

FPL
Group and FPL are subject to employee workforce factors that could adversely
affect the businesses and financial condition of FPL Group and FPL.

·

FPL
      Group and FPL are subject to employee workforce factors, including, for
      example, loss or retirement of key executives, availability of qualified
      personnel, inflationary pressures on payroll and benefits costs and
      collective bargaining agreements with union employees and work stoppage
      that could adversely affect the businesses and financial condition of FPL
      Group and FPL.

The
risks described herein are not the only risks facing FPL Group and
FPL.  Additional risks and uncertainties also may materially adversely
affect FPL Group's or FPL's business, financial condition and/or future
operating results.

Character of
Ownership.

Substantially all of FPL's properties are subject
to the lien of FPL's mortgage, which secures most debt securities issued by
FPL.  The majority of FPL's properties are held in fee and are free
from other encumbrances, subject to minor exceptions, none of which is of such a
nature as to substantially impair the usefulness to FPL of such
properties.  Some of FPL's electric lines are located on land not
owned in fee but are covered by necessary consents of governmental authorities
or rights obtained from owners of private property.  The majority of
NextEra Energy Resources' generating facilities are held in fee and a number of
those facilities are encumbered by liens against their assets securing various
financings.  Additionally, the majority of NextEra Energy Resources'
wind turbines and some fossil plants are located on land leased from owners of
private property.  See Generating Facilities and Note 1 -
Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization.

The
amount and timing of dividends payable on FPL Group's common stock are within
the sole discretion of FPL Group's Board of Directors.  The Board of
Directors reviews the dividend rate at least annually (generally in February) to
determine its appropriateness in light of FPL Group's financial position and
results of operations, legislative and regulatory developments affecting the
electric utility industry in general and FPL in particular, competitive
conditions and any other factors the board deems relevant.  The
ability of FPL Group to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon,
among other things, dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries.  There
are no restrictions in effect that currently limit FPL's ability to pay
dividends to FPL Group.  In February 2010, FPL Group announced that it
would increase its quarterly dividend on its common stock from $0.4725 to $0.50
per share.  See Management's Discussion - Liquidity and Capital
Resources - Covenants with respect to dividend restrictions and Note 11 -
Common Stock Dividend Restrictions regarding dividends paid by FPL to FPL
Group.

As of
the close of business on January 31, 2010, there were 27,994 holders of
record of FPL Group's common stock.

Item
7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

This
discussion should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements contained herein.  In the discussion of Results
of Operations below, all comparisons are with the corresponding items in the
prior year.

Overview

FPL
Group is one of the nation's largest providers of electricity-related
services.  It has two principal operating subsidiaries, FPL and
NextEra Energy Resources.  FPL serves more than 8.7 million people
throughout most of the east and lower west coasts of Florida.  NextEra
Energy Resources, FPL Group's competitive energy subsidiary, produces
electricity primarily using wind, natural gas and nuclear
resources.  Together, FPL's and NextEra Energy Resources' generating
assets represented approximately 42,700 mw of capacity at December 31,
2009.  See Item 2 - Generating Facilities.  Another of
FPL Group's operating subsidiaries, FPL FiberNet, provides fiber-optic services
to FPL, telecommunications companies and other customers throughout
Florida.

FPL
obtains its operating revenues primarily from the sale of electricity to retail
customers at rates established by the FPSC through base rates and cost recovery
clause mechanisms.  In March 2009, FPL filed a petition with the FPSC
requesting, among other things, a permanent base rate increase of approximately
$1 billion in 2010 and an additional $250 million in 2011, which included
additions to the storm and property insurance reserve.  The requested
increases were based on a proposed regulatory ROE of 12.5% and excluded amounts
associated with a proposed extension of the GBRA mechanism, which allowed for
automatic adjustments in retail base rates when approved power plants achieved
commercial operation, and certain proposed cost recovery clause
adjustments.

In
connection with the FPSC's January 2010 rate ruling with respect to FPL's March
2009 petition, the FPSC indicated that the ruling would be reflected in a final
written order to be issued in February 2010 (final order).  The
January 2010 rate ruling indicated that new retail base rates would be
established for FPL effective March 1, 2010, would increase retail base
rates by approximately $75 million on an annualized basis, would establish a
regulatory ROE of 10.0% with a range of plus or minus 100 basis points and would
shift certain costs from retail base rates to the capacity
clause.  The January 2010 rate ruling also indicated that depreciation
expense would be reduced over the next four years.  See Note 1 -
Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization.  The January 2010 rate
ruling also indicated, among other things, that any additional base rate
increase for 2011, the continuation of the GBRA mechanism and any additions to
the storm and property insurance reserve would be denied.  As of the
date of this report, the final order remains pending.  Upon issuance
of the final order, parties have the right to file motions with the FPSC for
reconsideration of some or all of the final order, or to appeal some or all of
the final order to the Florida Supreme Court.  In response to
inquiries regarding potential inconsistencies in calculations underlying the
January 2010 rate ruling, staff for the FPSC has indicated it would address any
matters raised by the parties before the final order following the filing of any
motions for reconsideration.  FPL cannot predict the specific
treatment of any particular issue in the final order.

FPL is
evaluating the impact of the January 2010 rate ruling on its financial position,
including its credit quality and ability to attract capital over the long
term.  See Liquidity and Capital Resources.  FPL has
suspended activities on the following projects representing approximately $10
billion of investment over the next five years until the financial impact of the
final order, along with other factors, such as load-growth estimates, fuel cost
forecasts, demand side management and environmental incentives, can be reviewed
(see Item I - FPL Operations - Capital Expenditures):

FPL is
also evaluating its options with respect to future regulatory actions regarding
the January 2010 rate ruling and, when it is issued, the final order, as well as
assessing the cost structure of its ongoing operations and reviewing other
planned capital expenditures for appropriate reductions.

Over the
last ten years, FPL's average annual customer growth has been
1.8%.  However, beginning in 2007, FPL has experienced a slowdown in
retail customer growth and a decline in non-weather related usage per retail
customer.  Retail customer growth in 2008 was 0.3%.  FPL's
average number of retail customers declined slightly during the first three
quarters of 2009 and remained essentially unchanged during the fourth quarter of
2009; the decline for the full year was 0.2%.  FPL believes that the
economic slowdown, the downturn in the housing market and the credit crisis that
have affected the country and the state of Florida have contributed to the
slowdown in customer growth and to the decline in non-weather related usage per
retail customer.  In December 2009, the unemployment rate in Florida
was 11.8%.  Beginning in 2007, FPL experienced an increase in inactive
accounts (accounts with installed meters without corresponding customer names)
and in low-usage customers (customers using less than 200 kwh per month), which
have contributed to the decline in retail customer growth and non-weather
related usage per retail customer.  In 2009, inactive accounts and
low-usage customers continued to increase much of the year but declined slightly
in the fourth quarter.  FPL is unable to predict whether or when
growth in customers and non-weather related customer usage might return to
previous trends.


NextEra
Energy Resources is in the competitive energy business with the majority of its
operating revenues derived from wholesale electricity sales.  NextEra
Energy Resources' strategy is, among other things, to continue to maintain its
leadership position in wind, accelerate growth in solar development, continue to
expand its transmission capability, grow its supply-related and non-asset based
businesses, and to develop its natural gas infrastructure
business.  NextEra Energy Resources' supply-related business includes
full energy and capacity requirements services and retail operations, and the
non-asset based business includes power and gas marketing and trading
operations.  NextEra Energy Resources seeks to expand its portfolio
primarily through wind and solar development and acquisitions where economic
prospects are attractive.  The Recovery Act includes, among other
things, provisions that allow companies building wind facilities the option to
choose among three investment cost recovery mechanisms: (i) PTCs which were
extended for wind facilities through 2012, (ii) ITCs of 30% of the cost for
qualifying wind facilities placed in service prior to 2013, or (iii) an election
to receive a cash grant of 30% of the cost of qualifying wind facilities placed
in service in 2009 or 2010, or if construction began prior to December 31,
2010 and the wind facility is placed in service prior to 2013.  An
election to receive a cash grant of 30%, in lieu of the 30% investment tax
credit allowable under present law, also applies to the cost of qualifying solar
facilities placed in service in either 2009 or 2010, or if construction began
prior to December 31, 2010 and the solar facility is placed in service
prior to 2017.  In 2009, NextEra Energy Resources added approximately
1,170 mw of wind generation to its portfolio, of which 985 mw were constructed
and 185 mw were from three operating wind projects purchased in the fourth
quarter of 2009.  NextEra Energy Resources expects to add
approximately 1,000 mw of new wind generation in 2010 and 1,000 mw to 1,500 mw
in each of 2011 and 2012.  In addition to wind expansion, NextEra
Energy Resources is considering several solar development opportunities in the
U.S., as well as in Europe.  The wind and solar expansions are subject
to, among other things, continued public policy support, support for the
construction and availability of sufficient transmission facilities and
capacity, continued market demand, supply chain expansion and access to capital
at reasonable cost and on reasonable terms.

NextEra
Energy Resources' market is diversified by region as well as by fuel
source.  See Item 2 - Generating Facilities.  NextEra Energy
Resources sells a large percentage of its expected output to hedge against price
volatility.  Consequently, if NextEra Energy Resources' plants do not
perform as expected, NextEra Energy Resources could be required to purchase
power at potentially higher market prices to meet its contractual
obligations.  NextEra Energy Resources' energy marketing and trading
business is focused primarily on managing commodity price risk and extracting
maximum value from its assets.

The U.S.
Congress, the EPA and certain states and regions are considering several
legislative and regulatory proposals that would establish new regulatory
requirements and reduction targets for GHG emissions.  The economic
and operational impact of these or any similar legislation and/or regulation on
FPL Group and FPL depends on a variety of factors, including, but not limited
to, the allowed emissions, whether the permitted emissions will be allocated or
auctioned, the cost to reduce emissions or buy allowances in the marketplace and
the availability of offsets and mitigating factors to moderate the costs of
compliance.  If and until legislation is enacted and implementing
regulations are adopted, the economic and operational impact (either positive or
negative) on FPL Group and FPL cannot be determined but could be
material.  In the case of FPL, increased costs associated with
compliance with new environmental regulations are generally recoverable from
customers, while the recovery of such increased costs for NextEra Energy
Resources would depend on market prices for electricity.  See
Item 1 - Environmental Matters.

Results
of Operations

FPL
Group and NextEra Energy Resources segregate into two categories unrealized
mark-to-market gains and losses on energy derivative transactions which are used
to manage commodity price risk.  The first category, referred to as
trading activities, represents the net unrealized effect of actively traded
positions entered into to take advantage of market price movements and to
optimize the value of generation assets and related contracts.  The
second category, referred to as non-qualifying hedges, represents the net
unrealized effect of derivative transactions entered into as economic hedges but
which do not qualify for hedge accounting and the ineffective portion of
transactions accounted for as cash flow hedges.  In January 2010, FPL
Group discontinued hedge accounting for its cash flow hedges related to energy
contract derivative instruments, which could result in increased volatility in
the non-qualifying hedge category.  At FPL, substantially all changes
in the fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory
asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any
gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause or the capacity
clause.

FPL
Group's management uses earnings excluding certain items (adjusted earnings)
internally for financial planning, for analysis of performance, for reporting of
results to the Board of Directors and as inputs in determining whether
performance targets are met for performance-based compensation under FPL Group's
employee incentive compensation plans.  FPL Group also uses adjusted
earnings when communicating its earnings outlook to
investors.  Adjusted earnings exclude the unrealized mark-to-market
effect of non-qualifying hedges and other than temporary impairment (OTTI)
losses on securities held in NextEra Energy Resources' nuclear decommissioning
funds, net of the reversal of previously recognized OTTI losses on securities
sold and losses on securities where price recovery was deemed unlikely
(collectively, OTTI reversals).  FPL Group's management believes
adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the company's
fundamental earnings power.  Although the excluded amounts are
properly included in the determination of net income in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, management believes that the amount
and/or nature of such items make period to period comparisons of operations
difficult and potentially confusing.  Adjusted earnings do not
represent a substitute for net income, as prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.


Summary

- Presented below is
a summary of net income (loss) by reportable segment (see
Note 15):

The
increase in FPL's 2009 results reflects retail base rate increases pursuant to
the GBRA mechanism under the 2005 rate agreement to reflect the placements in
service of WCEC Units Nos. 1 and 2, higher AFUDC on the WCEC units, a 0.3%
increase in usage per retail customer reflecting favorable weather conditions
partly offset by other factors, and higher cost recovery clause results partly
offset by higher O&M and depreciation and amortization
expenses.  FPL's 2008 results reflect lower retail customer usage,
higher depreciation and interest expenses and provisions taken in 2008 for
regulatory matters, partly offset by a retail base rate increase associated with
Turkey Point Unit No. 5 commencing commercial operation in 2007, lower
O&M expenses and higher other revenues and AFUDC - equity.

NextEra
Energy Resources’ 2009 results reflect increased earnings from new investments
and from full energy and capacity requirements services and trading, partly
offset by lower earnings from the existing portfolio, reflecting the negative
impacts of weather, and higher expenses to support the growth in the
business.  NextEra Energy Resources’ 2008 results reflect additional
earnings from the existing portfolio, from new investments and from full energy
and capacity requirements services and trading, partially offset by higher
expenses to support the growth in the business.  In addition, FPL
Group's and NextEra Energy Resources’ net income for 2009 and 2007 reflects net
unrealized after-tax losses from non-qualifying hedges of approximately $20
million and $86 million, respectively, while 2008 net income reflects net
unrealized after-tax gains from such hedges of $170 million.  The
change in unrealized mark-to-market activity is primarily attributable to
changes in forward power and natural gas prices, as well as the reversal of
previously recognized unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses as the
underlying transactions were realized.  As a general rule, a gain
(loss) in the non-qualifying hedge category is offset by decreases (increases)
in the fair value of related physical asset positions in the portfolio or
contracts, which are not marked to market under generally accepted accounting
principles.  In 2009, 2008 and 2007, NextEra Energy Resources recorded
$36 million, $82 million and $6 million, respectively, of after-tax OTTI losses
on securities held in its nuclear decommissioning funds.  In 2009 and
2008, NextEra Energy Resources had approximately $23 million and $6 million,
respectively, of after-tax OTTI reversals; there were no such OTTI reversals in
2007.

As a
result of the spent fuel settlement agreement (see Item I - FPL Operations -
Nuclear Operations and Item I - NextEra Energy Resources - Nuclear Operations),
FPL Group reduced its property, plant and equipment balances by $107 million
($83 million for FPL) and operating expenses by $15 million ($12 million for
FPL) and increased FPL Group’s operating revenues by $9 million.  The
spent fuel settlement agreement increased FPL Group's 2009 net income by
approximately $16 million ($9 million for FPL).  The spent fuel
settlement agreement permits FPL and NextEra Energy Resources to make annual
filings to recover certain spent fuel storage costs incurred by FPL and NextEra
Energy Resources which will be payable by the U.S. Government on an annual
basis.  The amount received from the U.S. Government related to
property, plant and equipment is included in cash flows from investing
activities on FPL Group's and FPL's consolidated statements of cash
flows.  Additional payments from the U.S. Government are
pending.  FPL and NextEra Energy Resources will continue to pay fees
to the U.S. Government's nuclear waste fund.

Results
for Corporate and Other in 2009 reflect higher interest income and realized and
unrealized gains on investments offset by lower consolidating income tax
adjustments and higher interest expense.  Results for Corporate and
Other in 2008 reflect higher interest expense offset by additional consolidating
income tax adjustments.

FPL
Group's effective income tax rate for all periods presented reflects PTCs for
wind projects at NextEra Energy Resources and deferred tax benefits associated
with grants (convertible ITCs) under the Recovery Act.  PTCs and
deferred tax benefits associated with convertible ITCs can significantly affect
FPL Group's effective income tax rate depending on the amount of pretax
income.  PTCs can be significantly affected by wind
generation.  See Note 1 - Income Taxes, Note 6 and
Note 10 - Sale of Differential Membership Interests.

FPL

- FPL's net income for
2009, 2008 and 2007 was $831 million, $789 million and $836 million,
respectively, an increase in 2009 of $42 million and a decrease in 2008 of $47
million.  The increase in FPL's 2009 results reflects retail base rate
increases associated with WCEC Units Nos. 1 and 2, higher AFUDC on the WCEC
units, a 0.3% increase in usage per retail customer reflecting favorable weather
conditions partly offset by other factors, and higher cost recovery clause
results partly offset by higher O&M and depreciation and amortization
expenses.  FPL's 2008 results reflect lower retail customer usage,
higher depreciation and interest expenses and provisions taken in 2008 for
regulatory matters, partly offset by a retail base rate increase associated with
Turkey Point Unit No. 5 commencing commercial operation in 2007, lower O&M
expenses and higher other revenues and AFUDC - equity.


See
Overview for a discussion of the FPSC's January 2010 rate
ruling.  Under the 2005 rate agreement, retail base rates did not
increase during the term of the agreement except to allow recovery under the
GBRA mechanism of the revenue requirements of FPL's three power plants that
achieved commercial operation during the term of the 2005 rate
agreement.  Retail base rates increased approximately $115 million on
an annualized basis when Turkey Point Unit No. 5 was placed in service in
2007.  Retail base rates increased approximately $265 million on an
annualized basis when WCEC Units Nos. 1 and 2 were placed in service in
2009.  These units are expected to realize significant fuel savings
from the time the units were placed in service.  During the term of
the 2005 rate agreement, FPL did not have an authorized regulatory ROE for the
purpose of addressing earnings levels, FPL reduced depreciation on its plant in
service by $125 million each year and FPL's revenues did not exceed the
thresholds established under the 2005 rate agreement's revenue sharing
mechanism.  See Note 1 - Revenues and Rates for information on
FPL's regulatory ROE.

FPL's
operating revenues consisted of the following:

For the
year ended December 31, 2009, a 0.2% decrease in the average number of
customer accounts reduced retail base revenues by approximately $8 million while
a 0.3% increase in usage per retail customer, reflecting favorable weather
conditions partly offset by other factors, increased retail base revenues by
approximately $30 million.  Customer usage in 2009 reflects one less
day of sales in 2009, as 2008 was a leap year.  Base rate increases
resulting from WCEC Units Nos. 1 and 2 commencing commercial operation in
2009 increased retail base revenues by approximately $68 million.  See
Overview for a discussion of FPL's customer growth, non-weather related usage
and the January 2010 rate ruling.

For the
year ended December 31, 2008, a 0.3% increase in the average number of
customer accounts increased retail base revenues by approximately $9 million
while a 2.7% decrease in usage per retail customer, reflecting weather
conditions and other factors, decreased retail base revenues by approximately
$95 million.  Partly offsetting the usage decrease was an extra day of
sales in 2008, as it was a leap year.  In addition, a base rate
increase resulting from Turkey Point Unit No. 5 commencing commercial
operation in 2007 increased retail base revenues by approximately $28
million.

The
increase in revenues from other cost recovery clauses and pass-through costs in
2009 is primarily due to additional revenues associated with the FPSC's nuclear
cost recovery rule and higher conservation and environmental clause
revenues.  The FPSC's nuclear cost recovery rule provides for the
recovery of prudently incurred pre-construction costs and carrying charges
(equal to a pretax AFUDC rate) on construction costs for new nuclear capacity
through levelized charges under the capacity clause.  In 2009, FPL
began recovering pre-construction costs associated with the development of two
additional units at the Turkey Point site and carrying charges (equal to a
pretax AFUDC rate) on construction costs associated with the addition of
approximately 400 mw of baseload capacity at its existing nuclear
units.  The same rule provides for the recovery of construction costs,
once the new capacity goes into service, through a base rate
increase.  See Overview for a discussion of activities related to the
development of two additional units at the Turkey Point site.


Revenues
from fuel and other cost recovery clauses and pass-through costs, such as
franchise fees, revenue taxes and storm-related surcharges, are largely a pass
through of costs.  Such revenues also include a return allowed to be
recovered through the cost recovery clauses on certain assets, primarily solar,
environmental and nuclear capacity additions.  In 2009, 2008 and 2007,
cost recovery clauses contributed $41 million, $25 million and $23 million,
respectively, to FPL's net income.  The increase in 2009 cost recovery
clause results is primarily due to a return related to additional solar,
environmental and nuclear capacity expenditures, partly offset by lower interest
earned on fuel clause underrecoveries.  The increase in 2008 cost
recovery clause results is primarily due to a return related to environmental
expenditures and higher interest earned on fuel clause underrecoveries, partly
offset by the absence of interest earned on FPL's unrecovered balance of the
storm reserve deficiency, which balance was collected upon the issuance of the
storm-recovery bonds in 2007.  In 2010, it is expected that cost
recovery clauses will contribute higher earnings for FPL as a result of
additional solar, environmental and nuclear capacity
expenditures.  Underrecovery or overrecovery of such cost recovery
clause and pass-through costs can significantly affect FPL Group's and FPL's
operating cash flows.  Fluctuations in fuel cost recovery revenues are
primarily driven by changes in fuel and energy charges which are included in
fuel, purchased power and interchange expense in the consolidated statements of
income, as well as by changes in energy sales.  Fluctuations in
revenues from other cost recovery clauses and pass-through costs are primarily
driven by changes in storm-related surcharges, capacity charges, franchise fee
costs, the impact of changes in O&M and depreciation expenses on the
underlying cost recovery clause, investment in solar and environmental projects,
investment in nuclear capacity until such capacity goes into service,
pre-construction costs associated with the development of two additional units
at the Turkey Point site and changes in energy sales.  Capacity
charges and franchise fee costs are included in fuel, purchased power and
interchange and taxes other than income taxes and other, respectively, in the
consolidated statements of income.

FPL uses
a risk management fuel procurement program which was approved by the FPSC at the
program's inception.  The FPSC reviews the program activities and
results for prudence on an annual basis as part of its annual review of fuel
costs.  The program is intended to manage fuel price volatility by
locking in fuel prices for a portion of FPL's fuel requirements.  The
current regulatory asset for the change in fair value of derivative instruments
used in the fuel procurement program amounted to approximately $68 million and
$1,109 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  The
decrease in fuel revenues in 2009 reflects approximately $210 million related to
a lower average fuel factor and $10 million attributable to lower energy
sales.  The increase in fuel revenues in 2008 reflects approximately
$230 million related to a higher average fuel factor, partly offset by $190
million attributable to lower energy sales.  Pursuant to an FPSC
order, FPL was required to refund in the form of a one-time credit to retail
customers' bills the 2009 year-end estimated fuel overrecovery; in January 2010,
approximately $403 million was refunded to retail customers.  At
December 31, 2009, approximately $356 million of retail fuel revenues were
overrecovered.  The difference between the refund and the
December 31, 2009 overrecovery will be collected from retail customers in a
subsequent period.  The increase from December 31, 2008 to
December 31, 2009 in deferred clause and franchise revenues and the
decrease in deferred clause and franchise expenses (current and noncurrent,
collectively) on FPL Group's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets totaled
approximately $624 million and positively affected FPL Group's and FPL's cash
flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31,
2009.

The
major components of FPL's fuel, purchased power and interchange expense are as
follows:

The
decrease in fuel and energy charges in 2009 was due to lower fuel and energy
prices.  The increase in fuel and energy charges in 2008 reflects
higher fuel and energy prices of approximately $224 million, partly offset by
approximately $194 million attributable to lower energy sales.


FPL's
O&M expenses increased $58 million in 2009 reflecting higher insurance and
employee benefit costs of approximately $51 million and $44 million,
respectively, partly offset by lower distribution, nuclear and fossil generation
costs of $26 million, $18 million and $10 million, respectively.  The
increase in insurance costs is primarily due to the absence of a refund
associated with an environmental insurance policy termination, which occurred in
2008, as well as higher nuclear insurance costs.  The increase in
employee benefit costs is primarily due to higher medical costs, a lower pension
credit and other costs driven by market conditions.  The decrease in
distribution costs reflects deferred projects and productivity
improvements.  The decline in nuclear generation costs reflects a
reimbursement of prior years’ costs related to the spent fuel settlement
agreement and lower costs related to 2008 plant improvement initiatives partly
offset by higher refueling and maintenance outage costs.  The decline
in fossil generation costs is primarily due to lower overhaul costs, partly
offset by additional costs related to WCEC Units Nos. 1 and 2.  Other
changes in O&M expenses were primarily driven by pass-through costs which
did not significantly affect net income.  Management expects O&M
expenses, excluding pass-through O&M costs, in 2010 to exceed the 2009 level
primarily due to higher nuclear and fossil generation, transmission and
distribution costs, as well as higher employee benefit and nuclear insurance
costs and the absence of the reimbursement of prior years’ costs related to the
spent fuel settlement agreement.  Beginning in 2009, FPL records, as
other receivables in the consolidated balance sheets, operating costs expected
to be reimbursed under the spent fuel settlement agreement.

FPL's
O&M expenses decreased $16 million in 2008 reflecting lower insurance,
employee benefit and distribution costs of approximately $47 million, $11
million and $10 million, respectively.  These decreases were partly
offset by higher nuclear generation, fossil generation, transmission and
customer service costs of approximately $21 million, $4 million, $3 million and
$20 million, respectively, as well as a reserve for regulatory
matters.  The decline in insurance costs was primarily due to the
termination by mutual agreement of an environmental insurance
policy.  The decline in employee benefit costs reflects a higher
pension credit as well as lower benefits due to declining market conditions,
partly offset by higher medical costs.  The decline in distribution
costs reflects cost reduction efforts and efficiencies as well as reduced work
load due to the decline in customer growth, partly offset by severance costs
incurred in 2008.  The increase in nuclear generation costs reflects
plant improvement initiatives to ensure long-term reliable
operations.  The fossil generation increase reflects costs associated
with plant maintenance, while the transmission increase reflects additional
improvement activities.  The customer service cost increase is
primarily due to higher uncollectible accounts.  Other changes in
O&M expenses were primarily driven by pass-through costs which did not
significantly affect net income.

Depreciation
and amortization expense in 2009 increased $237 million reflecting the
amortization of approximately $203 million of pre-construction costs associated
with FPL's planned nuclear units recovered under the nuclear cost recovery rule,
higher depreciation on transmission and distribution facilities (collectively,
approximately $21 million) and depreciation of $17 million on WCEC Units
Nos. 1 and 2, which were placed in service in 2009.  Depreciation
and amortization expense in 2008 increased $14 million, reflecting higher
depreciation on transmission and distribution facilities (collectively,
approximately $20 million) and higher depreciation on fossil generation assets
of $10 million, primarily Turkey Point Unit No. 5 which was placed in
service in 2007.  In addition, depreciation on nuclear assets was
higher by approximately $4 million primarily due to the steam generator and
reactor vessel head replacements at St. Lucie Unit No. 2.  These
increases were partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization expense
of $11 million primarily due to the absence of amortization of software and
other property that has been fully amortized.  Other changes in
depreciation and amortization expense were primarily driven by pass-through
costs, other than costs associated with the nuclear cost recovery rule, which
did not significantly affect net income.  In 2010, FPL will begin
amortizing over four years approximately $895 million of a depreciation reserve
surplus as required by the January 2010 rate ruling.  The $125 million
reduction in annual depreciation and amortization expense that FPL has been
recording since 2002 as permitted by the FPSC will cease in
2010.  Also, depreciation and amortization expense in 2010 is expected
to be affected by a reduction in nuclear cost recovery rule amortization
primarily as a result of the timing of expenditures.  See Note 1
- - Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization.

Taxes
other than income taxes and other increased $24 million and $40 million in 2009
and 2008, respectively, primarily due to changes in franchise fees and revenue
taxes, which are pass-through costs, and higher property taxes ($14 million and
$15 million, respectively), reflecting growth in plant in service
balances.  The increase in franchise fees in 2008 was primarily driven
by higher average franchise rates.

Interest
expense for 2009 reflects a decline in average interest rates of approximately
29 basis points, partly offset by higher average debt
balances.  Interest expense for 2008 reflects higher average debt
balances, partly offset by a decline in average interest rates of approximately
34 basis points.  Interest expense on storm-recovery bonds, as well as
certain other interest expense (collectively, clause interest), are essentially
pass-through amounts and do not significantly affect net income, as the clause
interest is recovered either under cost recovery clause mechanisms or through a
storm-recovery bond surcharge.  Clause interest for 2009, 2008 and
2007 amounted to approximately $45 million, $44 million and $32 million,
respectively.  For both 2009 and 2008, interest expense was reduced by
higher allowance for borrowed funds used during construction (see AFUDC -
equity explanation below).

The
increase in AFUDC - equity for 2009 and 2008 is primarily attributable to
additional AFUDC - equity on three natural gas-fired combined-cycle units of
approximately 1,220 mw each at WCEC, partly offset, in 2008, by the absence of
AFUDC - equity on Turkey Point Unit No. 5 and the steam generator and
reactor vessel head replacement projects at St. Lucie Unit
No. 2.


Interest
income declined in 2009 primarily due to lower average investment balances and
lower interest rates.  The decline in 2008 reflects the cessation of
interest on FPL's unrecovered balance of the storm reserve deficiency, which
balance was collected upon the issuance of the storm-recovery bonds in 2007,
partly offset by higher interest income earned on higher average investment
balances.

FPL
currently faces competition from other suppliers of electrical energy to
wholesale customers and from alternative energy sources and self-generation for
other customer groups, primarily industrial customers.  The FERC has
jurisdiction over potential changes that could affect competition in wholesale
transactions.  In 2009, operating revenues from wholesale and
industrial customers combined represented approximately 4% of FPL's total
operating revenues.  Various states, other than Florida, have enacted
legislation or have state commissions that have issued orders designed to allow
retail customers to choose their electricity supplier.  Management
believes it is unlikely there will be any state actions to restructure the
retail electric industry in Florida in the near future.  If the basis
of regulation for some or all of FPL's business changes from cost-based
regulation, existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off
unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or
refund.  Further, other aspects of the business, such as generation
assets and long-term power purchase commitments, would need to be reviewed to
assess their recoverability in a changed regulatory environment.  See
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Regulatory Accounting.

FPL is
currently constructing a natural gas-fired combined-cycle unit of approximately
1,220 mw at its WCEC, which is expected to be placed in service by
mid-2011.  In addition, FPL is in the process of adding approximately
400 mw of baseload capacity at its existing nuclear units at St. Lucie and
Turkey Point, which additional capacity is projected to be placed in service by
the end of 2012.

NextEra Energy Resources

-
NextEra Energy Resources’ net income for 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $849 million,
$915 million and $540 million, respectively, a decrease in 2009 of $66 million
and an increase in 2008 of $375 million.  The primary drivers, on an
after-tax basis, of these changes were as follows:

¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾

(a)

Includes
      PTCs and ITCs on wind projects and ITCs on solar projects and, for new
      investments, deferred tax benefits associated with convertible ITCs (see
      Note 1 - Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization, Note 1 -
      Income Taxes and Note 6) but does not include allocation of interest
      expense or corporate general and administrative
      expenses.  Results from new projects are included in new
      investments during the first twelve months of operation.  A
      project's results are included in existing assets beginning with the
      thirteenth month of operation.

(b)

For
      discussion of derivative instruments, see Note 3 and
      Overview.

The
increase in NextEra Energy Resources’ 2009 results from new investments reflects
the addition of over 2,490 mw of wind generation during or after
2008.  In addition, results from new investments for the year ended
December 31, 2009 include approximately $87 million of deferred tax
benefits associated with convertible ITCs.  The increase in NextEra
Energy Resources’ 2008 results from new investments reflects the addition of
over 3,200 mw of wind and nuclear generation during or after 2007.

In 2009,
results from NextEra Energy Resources' existing asset portfolio decreased
approximately $110 million primarily due to unfavorable results in the ERCOT and
NEPOOL regions due primarily to unfavorable market conditions, lower results of
$75 million associated with existing wind projects primarily due to a lower wind
resource across the portfolio and lower results of $36 million from the
contracted portfolio, partially offset by higher results ($42 million) from
NextEra Energy Resources’ retail energy provider due to favorable residential
margins, a state tax benefit related to a change in state tax law on certain
wind projects and favorable results at Seabrook primarily due to higher
prices.  A planned and unplanned outage at Seabrook in the fourth
quarter of 2009 was substantially offset by planned and unplanned outages in
2008.  In 2008, results from NextEra Energy Resources’ existing asset
portfolio increased approximately $76 million due to favorable results in the
NEPOOL, ERCOT and PJM regions reflecting favorable market conditions, favorable
hydro resource and favorable hedge pricing partially offset by the impact of
planned and unplanned outages at the Seabrook nuclear facility.  In
addition, the existing wind portfolio experienced a favorable wind
resource.  These factors were partially offset by lower results of
approximately $14 million from NextEra Energy Resources' retail energy provider
primarily due to unfavorable commodity margins.  Results in 2008 in
PJM benefited from a new FERC-approved forward capacity market that began in
June 2007.


NextEra
Energy Resources’ 2009 and 2008 financial results benefited from increased gains
from its full energy and capacity requirements services and trading
activities.  Full energy and capacity requirements services include
load-following services, which require the supplier of energy to vary the
quantity delivered based on the load demand needs of the customer, as well as
various ancillary services.

Asset
sales in 2009 represent the sale of wind development rights, the sale of a 50 mw
wind project and the sale of an interest in a waste-to-energy project, which
contained an option for the buyer to sell the project back to NextEra Energy
Resources.  An additional after-tax gain of approximately $11 million
on the waste-to-energy project has been recorded in 2010 when the buyer's option
expired.  Asset sales in 2008 reflect a gain on the sale of
development rights on a natural gas project.

In both
2009 and 2008, interest expense, differential membership costs and other
reflects increased costs due to growth of the business partially offset in 2008
by certain state income tax benefits.  In 2009, an approximately $18
million income tax benefit from a reduction of previously deferred income taxes
resulting from an additional equity investment in Canadian operations was offset
by other income tax expenses in 2009 and the absence of other income tax
benefits recorded in the prior year.

In 2009
and 2007, NextEra Energy Resources recorded net unrealized after-tax losses from
non-qualifying hedges of approximately $20 million and $86 million,
respectively.  In 2008, NextEra Energy Resources recorded net
unrealized mark-to-market after-tax gains from non-qualifying hedges of
approximately $170 million.  The change in unrealized mark-to-market
activity is primarily attributable to changes in forward power and natural gas
prices, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized
mark-to-market gains or losses as the underlying transactions were
realized.  In 2009, 2008 and 2007, NextEra Energy Resources recorded
$36 million, $82 million and $6 million, respectively, of after-tax OTTI losses
on securities held in its nuclear decommissioning funds.  In 2009 and
2008, NextEra Energy Resources had approximately $23 million and $6 million,
respectively, of after-tax OTTI reversals; there were no such OTTI reversals in
2007.

Operating
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased $573 million
primarily due to losses of $88 million on unrealized mark-to-market
non-qualifying hedge activity in 2009 compared to gains on such hedges of $232
million in 2008.  Excluding this mark-to-market activity, revenues
were affected by unfavorable market conditions in the NEPOOL, ERCOT and PJM
regions and an unfavorable wind resource, partly offset by higher operating
revenues at PMI and NextEra Energy Resources' retail energy provider
(collectively, approximately $384 million) and project additions ($131
million).  Operating revenues for the year ended December 31,
2008 increased $1,096 million primarily due to gains of $232 million on
unrealized mark-to-market non-qualifying hedge activity in 2008 compared to
losses on such hedges of $342 million in 2007.  Excluding this
mark-to-market activity, revenues benefited from project additions, favorable
market conditions in the NEPOOL, ERCOT and PJM regions, and favorable wind and
hydro resources (collectively, $587 million) partially offset by nuclear planned
and unplanned outages of approximately $65 million.

Operating
expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased $291 million
primarily due to lower fuel costs of approximately $390 million partially offset
by project additions of $94 million and higher corporate general and
administrative expenses of $12 million to support the growth in the
business.  In addition, operating expenses reflect $60 million of
unrealized mark-to-market gains from non-qualifying hedges compared to $53
million of such gains in 2008.  Operating expenses for the year ended
December 31, 2008 increased $522 million, reflecting $53 million of
unrealized mark-to-market gains from non-qualifying hedges compared to $198
million of gains on such hedges in 2007.  Excluding these
mark-to-market changes, which are reflected in fuel, purchased power and
interchange expense in FPL Group's consolidated statements of income, operating
expenses increased primarily due to project additions, higher fuel costs and
higher corporate general and administrative expenses to support the growth in
the business.

Equity
in earnings of equity method investees in 2009 decreased $41 million due to
unfavorable market conditions and the absence of certain favorable contractual
provisions which benefited the prior periods at a project in the PJM
region.  Equity in earnings of equity method investees in 2008
increased $25 million due to improved market conditions in the PJM
region.

NextEra
Energy Resources' interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2009
increased $43 million due to increased borrowings to support the growth of the
business, partially offset by a decrease in interest rates of approximately 37
basis points.  NextEra Energy Resources’ interest expense for the year
ended December 31, 2008 decreased $1 million.  Gains on disposal
of assets - net in FPL Group's consolidated statements of income for
2009 reflect $56 million of gains on sales of securities held in NextEra Energy
Resources' nuclear decommissioning funds and in 2008 reflect an approximately
$10 million gain on the sale of development rights related to a natural gas
project and $8 million of gains on sales of securities held in nuclear
decommissioning funds.

PTCs
from NextEra Energy Resources’ wind projects are reflected in NextEra Energy
Resources’ earnings.  PTCs are recognized as wind energy is generated
and sold based on a per kwh rate prescribed in applicable federal and state
statutes, and amounted to approximately $255 million, $262 million and $219
million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.  In addition, FPL Group's effective income tax rate for
year ended December 31, 2009 was affected by deferred tax benefits associated
with convertible ITCs of $88 million.  See
Note 6.


NextEra
Energy Resources expects its future portfolio capacity growth to come primarily
from wind and solar development and from asset acquisitions.  NextEra
Energy Resources added approximately 1,170 mw of wind generation in 2009, of
which 985 mw were constructed and 185 mw were from three operating wind projects
purchased in the fourth quarter of 2009.  NextEra Energy Resources
expects to add approximately 1,000 mw of new wind generation in 2010 and 1,000
mw to 1,500 mw in each of 2011 and 2012.  In addition, NextEra Energy
Resources intends to pursue opportunities for new solar generating
facilities.  The wind and solar expansions are subject to, among other
things, continued public policy support, support for the construction and
availability of sufficient transmission facilities and capacity, continued
market demand, supply chain expansion and access to capital at reasonable cost
and on reasonable terms.  Currently, in the United States, 31 states
have RPS requiring electricity providers in the state to meet a certain
percentage of their retail sales with energy from renewable
sources.  These standards vary by state, but the majority include
requirements to meet 10% to 25% of the electricity providers' retail sales with
energy from renewable sources by 2025.  NextEra Energy Resources
believes that these standards will create incremental demand for renewable
energy in the future.

Competitive
wholesale markets in the United States continue to evolve and vary among and
within geographic regions.  Revenues from electricity sales in these
markets vary based on the prices obtainable for energy, capacity and other
ancillary services.  Some of the factors affecting success in these
markets include the ability to operate generating assets efficiently and
reliably, the price and supply of fuel, transmission constraints, wind, solar
and hydro resources (weather conditions), competition from regulated utilities
and new sources of generation, effective risk management, demand growth,
environmental requirements and exposure to legal and regulatory
changes.

Expanded
competition in a frequently changing regulatory environment presents both
opportunities and risks for NextEra Energy Resources.  Opportunities
exist for the selective acquisition of generation assets and for the
construction and operation of efficient plants that can sell power in
competitive markets.  NextEra Energy Resources seeks to reduce its
market risk by having a diversified portfolio by fuel type and location, as well
as by contracting for the future sale of a significant amount of the electricity
output of its plants.  The combination of new wind and solar projects
and asset acquisitions are expected to be the key drivers supporting NextEra
Energy Resources’ growth over the next few years.

NextEra
Energy Resources’ earnings are subject to variability due to, among other
things, operational performance, commodity price exposure, counterparty
performance, weather conditions and project restructuring
activities.  NextEra Energy Resources’ exposure to commodity price
risk is reduced by the degree of contract coverage obtained for 2010 and
2011.  Therefore, if NextEra Energy Resources’ plants do not perform
as expected, NextEra Energy Resources could be required to purchase power at
potentially higher market prices to meet its contractual
obligations.  In addition to the effect of temperature, which is
reflected in commodity prices and demand, changes in weather affect production
levels of the wind portfolio as well as the hydro units in Maine and the solar
units in California.  In managing its exposure to commodity prices,
NextEra Energy Resources is dependent upon its counterparties to perform under
their contractual obligations.  NextEra Energy Resources actively
manages the trade-off between market risk and credit risk, as well as exposure
with individual counterparties as a function of their
creditworthiness.  As of December 31, 2009, substantially all of
NextEra Energy Resources’ 2010 contracted revenues are with investment grade
counterparties.

Corporate and Other

-
Corporate and Other is primarily comprised of interest expense, the operating
results of FPL FiberNet and other business activities as well as corporate
interest income and expenses.  Corporate and Other allocates interest
expense to NextEra Energy Resources based on a deemed capital structure at
NextEra Energy Resources of 50% debt for operating projects and 100% debt for
projects under construction.  For these purposes, the deferred credit
associated with differential membership interests sold by a NextEra Energy
Resources subsidiary in December 2007 is included with debt.  Each
subsidiary's income taxes are calculated based on the "separate return method,"
except that tax benefits that could not be used on a separate return basis, but
are used on the consolidated tax return, are recorded by the subsidiary that
generated the tax benefits.  Any remaining consolidated income tax
benefits or expenses are recorded at Corporate and Other.  The major
components of Corporate and Other's results, on an after-tax basis, are as
follows:


The
increase in interest expense in 2009 and 2008 reflects additional debt
outstanding, partly offset by a higher allocation of interest costs to NextEra
Energy Resources and lower average interest rates of approximately 66 basis
points and 91 basis points, respectively.  The increase in interest
income in 2009 is primarily due to earnings on an energy-related loan made to a
third party by an FPL Group Capital subsidiary.  Interest income in
2008 reflects lower interest rates on temporary investments offset by additional
earnings on energy-related loans made to third parties by FPL Group Capital
subsidiaries.  The federal and state income tax benefits reflect
consolidating income tax adjustments.  Other includes all other
corporate income and expenses, as well as other business
activities.  The increase in other primarily reflects realized and
unrealized gains on investments which are reflected in other - net in the
consolidated statements of income.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

FPL
Group and its subsidiaries, including FPL, require funds to support and grow
their businesses.  These funds are used for working capital, capital
expenditures, investments in or acquisitions of assets and businesses, to pay
maturing debt obligations and, from time to time, to redeem or repurchase
outstanding debt or equity securities.  It is anticipated that these
requirements will be satisfied through a combination of internally generated
funds, borrowings, and the issuance, from time to time, of debt and equity
securities, consistent with FPL Group's and FPL's objective of maintaining, on a
long-term basis, a capital structure that will support a strong investment grade
credit rating.  FPL Group, FPL and FPL Group Capital access the credit
and capital markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements
that are not satisfied by operating cash flows.  The inability of FPL
Group, FPL and FPL Group Capital to maintain their current credit ratings could
affect their ability to raise short- and long-term capital, their cost of
capital and the execution of their respective financing strategies, and could
require the posting of additional collateral under certain
agreements.  In January 2010, Moody's Investors Service, Inc.
(Moody's), Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P) and Fitch Ratings
(Fitch) placed FPL Group, FPL Group Capital and FPL on negative credit watch
with the possibility of a credit ratings downgrade.  The rating
agencies indicated their review for potential downgrade of the ratings is
prompted by, among other things, the heightened risk to investors caused by a
decline in the regulatory environment for investor-owned utilities operating in
Florida and continued challenging economic conditions throughout
Florida.  FPL Group and FPL are unable to predict whether or when a
credit ratings downgrade may occur.  See Credit Ratings
below.

The
global and domestic credit and capital markets experienced unprecedented levels
of volatility and disruption in the recent past.  This significantly
affected the cost and available sources of liquidity in the financial
markets.  FPL and FPL Group Capital have continued to have access to
commercial paper and short- and long-term credit and capital
markets.  If capital and credit market conditions change, this could
alter spending plans at FPL and NextEra Energy Resources.

Available Liquidity

- At
December 31, 2009, FPL Group's total net available liquidity was
approximately $4.4 billion, of which FPL's portion was approximately $2.0
billion.  The components of each company's net available liquidity at
December 31, 2009 were as follows:

¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾

(a)

Provide
      for the issuance of letters of credit up to $6,390 million ($2,473 million
      for FPL) and are available to support FPL's and FPL Group Capital's
      commercial paper programs and short-term borrowings and to provide
      additional liquidity in the event of a loss to the companies' or their
      subsidiaries' operating facilities (including, in the case of FPL, a
      transmission and distribution property loss), as well as for general
      corporate purposes.  FPL's bank revolving lines of credit are
      also available to support the purchase of $633 million of pollution
      control, solid waste disposal and industrial development revenue bonds
      (tax exempt bonds) in the event they are tendered by individual bond
      holders and not remarketed prior to maturity.

(b)

$17
      million of FPL's and $40 million of FPL Group Capital's bank revolving
      lines of credit expire in 2012.  The remaining portion of bank
      revolving lines of credit for FPL and FPL Group Capital expire in
      2013.


As of
February 25, 2010, 37 banks participate in FPL's and FPL Group Capital's credit
facilities and FPL's revolving term loan facility, with no one bank providing
more than 8% of the combined credit facilities and FPL's revolving term loan
facility.  In order for FPL Group Capital to borrow under the terms of
its credit facility, FPL Group (which guarantees the payment of FPL Group
Capital's credit facility pursuant to a 1998 guarantee agreement) is required to
maintain a ratio of funded debt to total capitalization that does not exceed a
stated ratio.  The FPL Group Capital credit facility also contains
default and related acceleration provisions relating to, among other things,
failure of FPL Group to maintain a ratio of funded debt to total capitalization
at or below the specified ratio.  Similarly, in order for FPL to
borrow under the terms of its credit facility and revolving term loan facility,
FPL is required to maintain a ratio of funded debt to total capitalization that
does not exceed a stated ratio.  The FPL credit facility and revolving
term loan facility also contain default and related acceleration provisions
relating to, among other things, failure of FPL to maintain a ratio of funded
debt to total capitalization at or below the specified ratio.  At
December 31, 2009, each of FPL Group and FPL was in compliance with its required
ratio.

In
January 2009, FPL Group entered into an agreement under which FPL Group may
offer and sell, from time to time, FPL Group common stock having a gross sales
price of up to $400 million.  During 2009, FPL Group received gross
proceeds through the sale and issuance of common stock under this agreement of
approximately $160 million consisting of 2,890,000 shares at an average price of
$55.53 per share.

At
December 31, 2009, FPL had the capacity to absorb up to approximately $198
million in future prudently incurred storm restoration costs without seeking
recovery through a rate adjustment from the FPSC.  Also, an indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources has established an $80
million letter of credit facility which expires in 2017 and serves as security
for certain obligations under commodity hedge agreements entered into by the
subsidiary.

Letters of Credit, Surety Bonds and
Guarantees

- FPL Group and FPL obtain letters of credit and surety bonds,
and issue guarantees to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties
and financings.  At December 31, 2009, FPL Group had
approximately $751 million of standby letters of credit ($14 million for FPL),
approximately $95 million of surety bonds ($55 million for FPL) and
approximately $8.9 billion notional amount of guarantees ($648 million for FPL),
of which approximately $6.6 billion ($24 million for FPL) letters of credit and
guarantees have expirations within the next five years.  An aggregate
of approximately $495 million ($3 million for FPL) of the standby letters of
credit at December 31, 2009 were issued under FPL's and FPL Group Capital's
credit facilities.  See Available Liquidity above.  Letters
of credit, surety bonds and guarantees support, among other things, the buying
and selling of wholesale energy commodities, debt and related reserves, capital
expenditures for wind development, nuclear activities, the commercial paper
program of FPL's consolidated VIE from which it leases nuclear fuel and other
contractual agreements.  Each of FPL Group and FPL believe it is
unlikely that it would incur any liabilities associated with these letters of
credit, surety bonds and guarantees.  Accordingly, at
December 31, 2009, FPL Group and FPL did not have any liabilities recorded
for these letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees.  In
addition, FPL Group has guaranteed certain payment obligations of FPL Group
Capital, including most of its debt and all of its debentures and commercial
paper issuances, as well as most of its payment guarantees, and FPL Group
Capital has guaranteed certain debt and other obligations of NextEra Energy
Resources and its subsidiaries.  See
Note 14 - Commitments.  Due to fluctuations in the
value of investments held in the nuclear decommissioning fund for Duane Arnold,
the balance in that fund is at certain times below the NRC minimum funding
requirement and could require posting of additional amounts to meet that
requirement.  As required by the NRC, in November 2009, NextEra Energy
Resources submitted its proposed plan to the NRC for providing financial
assurance for decommissioning funding for Duane Arnold, including the proposed
elimination of the existing $93 million parent company guaranty for
decommissioning.  The ultimate amount of the guarantee for NextEra
Energy Resources' decommissioning obligations for Duane Arnold, if any, could
vary depending on the market performance of the investments held in the nuclear
decommissioning fund and on the NRC's position on NextEra Energy Resources'
proposed plan.

Shelf Registration

- In
August 2009, FPL Group, FPL Group Capital, FPL and certain affiliated trusts
filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC for an unspecified amount of
securities.  The amount of securities issuable by the companies is
established from time to time by their respective boards of
directors.  As of February 25, 2010, securities that may be issued
under the registration statement, which became effective upon filing, include,
depending on the registrant, senior debt securities, subordinated debt
securities, junior subordinated debentures, first mortgage bonds, preferred
trust securities, common stock, preferred stock, stock purchase contracts, stock
purchase units, warrants and guarantees related to certain of those
securities.  As of February 25, 2010, FPL Group and FPL Group Capital
had approximately $1.7 billion (issuable by either or both of them up to such
aggregate amount) of board-authorized available capacity, and FPL had $0.5
billion of board-authorized available capacity.

A
      security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities
      and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  The
      rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning
      rating organization.

(b)

In
      January 2010, FPL Group, FPL and FPL Group Capital were placed on a
      negative credit watch with the possibility of a credit ratings downgrade
      by each of Moody's, S&P and
Fitch.

FPL
Group and its subsidiaries, including FPL, have no credit rating downgrade
triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding
debt.  A change in ratings is not an event of default under applicable
debt instruments, and while there are conditions to drawing on the credit
facilities maintained by FPL and FPL Group Capital, the maintenance of a
specific minimum credit rating is not a condition to drawing on those credit
facilities.  Commitment fees and interest rates on loans under the
credit facilities' agreements are tied to credit ratings.  A ratings
downgrade also could reduce the accessibility and increase the cost of
commercial paper and other short-term debt issuances and additional or
replacement credit facilities.  In addition, a ratings downgrade could
result in the requirement that FPL Group subsidiaries, including FPL, post
collateral under certain agreements, including those related to fuel
procurement, power sales and purchases, nuclear decommissioning funding,
debt-related reserves and trading activities.  If FPL's credit rating
was downgraded by one or two levels, it would not be required to post additional
collateral under these agreements.  If FPL Group Capital's credit
rating was downgraded to BBB+/Baa1, which is a one level downgrade for S&P
and a two level downgrade for Moody's and Fitch, FPL Group Capital would be
required to post additional collateral of approximately $150
million.  FPL's and FPL Group Capital's bank revolving lines of credit
are available to support the potential requirements discussed
above.  See Available Liquidity above.

Cash Flow

- The changes in
cash and cash equivalents are summarized as follows:

FPL
Group's cash and cash equivalents decreased for the year ended December 31,
2009 reflecting capital investments by FPL and NextEra Energy Resources, the
payment of common stock dividends to FPL Group shareholders and margin cash
collateral provided to NextEra Energy Resources'
counterparties.  These outflows were partially offset by cash
generated by operating activities, net issuances of both long- and short-term
debt and the issuance of common stock.

FPL
Group's cash flows from operating activities for the year ended
December 31, 2009 reflect cash generated by net income and the overrecovery
of fuel costs by FPL in 2009, as well as the recovery of prior period
deferrals.  These inflows were partially offset by margin cash
collateral provided to NextEra Energy Resources' counterparties as a result of
changing energy prices.


FPL
Group's cash flows from investing activities for the year ended
December 31, 2009 reflect capital investments, including nuclear fuel
purchases, of approximately $2.7 billion by FPL to expand and enhance its
electric system and generating facilities to continue to provide reliable
service to meet the power needs of present and future customers and investments
in independent power projects of approximately $3.2 billion by NextEra Energy
Resources.  FPL Group's cash flows from investing activities also
include the cash grants under the Recovery Act, the receipt of funds from the
spent fuel settlement agreement, the purchase and sale of restricted securities
held in the special use funds, including the reinvestment of fund earnings and
new contributions by NextEra Energy Resources, as well as other investment
activity, primarily at FPL Group Capital.  In 2010, FPL Group expects
to receive approximately $417 million ($44 million at FPL) in cash grants under
the Recovery Act for energy projects placed in service in 2009.

During
the year ended December 31, 2009, FPL Group generated proceeds from
financing activities, net of related issuance costs, of approximately $3.6
billion, including a net increase in short-term debt of $154 million (comprised
of $109 million and $45 million at FPL Group Capital and FPL, respectively),
$198 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock, primarily under FPL
Group's continuous offering agreement (see Available Liquidity above), and the

During
the year ended December 31, 2009, FPL Group paid approximately $2.4 billion
in connection with financing activities, including $725 million for FPL Group
Capital debt maturities, $225 million for maturing FPL first mortgage bonds,
approximately $441 million of NextEra Energy Resources' debt payments including
principal prepayment on a term loan and principal payments, approximately $205
million of FPL Group Capital debt payments including principal prepayment on a
term loan and repurchase of junior subordinated debentures, approximately $38
million principal payment on storm-recovery bonds and $766 million for the
payment of dividends on FPL Group's common stock.  In February 2010,
FPL issued $500 million principal amount of 5.69% first mortgage bonds maturing
2040.

In 2008,
FPL entered into a reclaimed water agreement with Palm Beach County (PBC) to
provide FPL's WCEC with reclaimed water beginning in January
2011.  Under the reclaimed water agreement, FPL is to construct a
reclaimed water system, including modifications to an existing treatment plant
and a water pipeline, that PBC will legally own and operate.  The
reclaimed water agreement also requires PBC to issue bonds for the purpose of
paying the costs associated with the construction of the reclaimed water
system.  In July 2009, PBC issued approximately $68 million principal
amount of bonds.  For financial reporting purposes, FPL is considered
the owner of the reclaimed water system and FPL and FPL Group are recording
electric utility plant in service and other property as costs are incurred and
long-term debt as costs are eligible for reimbursement by PBC to
FPL.  See Note 12.

During
the year ended December 31, 2009, indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of
NextEra Energy Resources and FPL Group Capital entered into interest rate swap
agreements.  See Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk
Sensitivity - Market Risk Sensitivity.

FPL
Group's cash and cash equivalents increased for the year ended December 31,
2008, reflecting cash generated by operating activities and net issuances of
both long- and short-term debt.  These inflows were partially offset
by capital investments by FPL and NextEra Energy Resources, the payment of
common stock dividends to FPL Group shareholders and the funding of a $500
million loan.


FPL
Group's cash and cash equivalents decreased for the year ended December 31,
2007, reflecting capital investments by FPL and NextEra Energy Resources, the
payment of common stock dividends to FPL Group shareholders and an increase in
customer receivables.  These outflows were partially offset by cash
generated by operating activities, net issuances of both long- and short-term
debt, the sale of independent power investments, the return of margin cash
collateral from counterparties and a distribution relating to an Indonesian
project.

Covenants

- FPL Group's
charter does not limit the dividends that may be paid on its common
stock.  As a practical matter, the ability of FPL Group to pay
dividends on its common stock is dependent upon, among other things, dividends
paid to it by its subsidiaries.  During the first quarter of 2009, FPL
Group increased the quarterly dividend on its common stock from $0.445 to
$0.4725 per share.  In February 2010, FPL Group announced that it
would increase the quarterly dividend on its common stock from $0.4725 to $0.50
per share.  FPL pays dividends to FPL Group in a manner consistent
with FPL's long-term targeted capital structure.  The mortgage
securing FPL's first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain
conditions, restrict the payment of dividends to FPL Group and the issuance of
additional first mortgage bonds.  In light of FPL's current financial
condition and level of earnings, management does not expect that planned
financing activities or dividends would be affected by these
limitations.

Under
the mortgage, in some cases, the amount of retained earnings that FPL can use to
pay cash dividends on its common stock is restricted.  The restricted
amount may change based on factors set out in the mortgage.  Other
than this restriction on the payment of common stock dividends, the mortgage
does not restrict FPL's use of retained earnings.  As of
December 31, 2009, no retained earnings were restricted by these provisions
of the mortgage.

FPL may
issue first mortgage bonds under its mortgage subject to its meeting an adjusted
net earnings test set forth in the mortgage, which generally requires adjusted
net earnings to be at least twice the annual interest requirements on, or at
least 10% of the aggregate principal amount of, FPL's first mortgage bonds
including those to be issued and any other non-junior FPL
indebtedness.  As of December 31, 2009, after giving effect to
the February 2010 issuance of the $500 million 5.69% first mortgage bonds
maturing in 2040, coverage for the 12 months ended December 31, 2009 would
have been approximately 6.2 times the annual interest requirements and
approximately 3.6 times the aggregate principal requirements.  New
first mortgage bonds are also limited to an amount equal to the sum of 60% of
unfunded property additions after adjustments to offset property retirements,
the amount of retired first mortgage bonds or qualified lien bonds and the
amount of cash on deposit with the mortgage trustee.  As of
December 31, 2009, after giving effect to the February 2010 issuance of the
$500 million 5.69% first mortgage bonds maturing in 2040, FPL could have issued
in excess of $7.4 billion of additional first mortgage bonds based on the
unfunded property additions and in excess of $5.8 billion based on retired first
mortgage bonds.  As of December 31, 2009, no cash was deposited
with the mortgage trustee for these purposes.


In
September 2006, FPL Group and FPL Group Capital executed a Replacement Capital
Covenant (September 2006 RCC) in connection with FPL Group Capital's offering of
$350 million principal amount of Series A Enhanced Junior Subordinated
Debentures due 2066 and $350 million principal amount of Series B Enhanced
Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 (collectively, Series A and Series B
junior subordinated debentures).  The September 2006 RCC is for the
benefit of persons that buy, hold or sell a specified series of long-term
indebtedness (covered debt) of FPL Group Capital (other than the Series A and
Series B junior subordinated debentures) or, in certain cases, of FPL
Group.  FPL Group Capital Trust I's 5 7/8% Preferred Trust Securities
have been initially designated as the covered debt under the September 2006
RCC.  The September 2006 RCC provides that FPL Group Capital may
redeem, and FPL Group or FPL Group Capital may purchase, any Series A and Series
B junior subordinated debentures on or before October 1, 2036, only to the
extent that the redemption or purchase price does not exceed a specified amount
of proceeds from the sale of qualifying securities, subject to certain
limitations described in the September 2006 RCC.  Qualifying
securities are securities that have equity-like characteristics that are the
same as, or more equity-like than, the Series A and Series B junior subordinated
debentures at the time of redemption or purchase, which are sold within 180 days
prior to the date of the redemption or repurchase of the Series A and Series B
junior subordinated debentures.

In June
2007, FPL Group and FPL Group Capital executed a Replacement Capital Covenant
(June 2007 RCC) in connection with FPL Group Capital's offering of $400 million
principal amount of its Series C Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2067 (Series
C junior subordinated debentures).  The June 2007 RCC is for the
benefit of persons that buy, hold or sell a specified series of covered debt of
FPL Group Capital (other than the Series C junior subordinated debentures) or,
in certain cases, of FPL Group. FPL Group Capital Trust I's 5 7/8% Preferred
Trust Securities have been initially designated as the covered debt under the
June 2007 RCC.  The June 2007 RCC provides that FPL Group Capital may
redeem or purchase, or satisfy, discharge or defease (collectively, defease),
and FPL Group and any majority-owned subsidiary of FPL Group or FPL Group
Capital may purchase, any Series C junior subordinated debentures on or before
June 15, 2037, only to the extent that the principal amount defeased or the
applicable redemption or purchase price does not exceed a specified amount
raised from the issuance, during the 180 days prior to the date of that
redemption, purchase or defeasance, of qualifying securities that have
equity-like characteristics that are the same as, or more equity-like than, the
applicable characteristics of the Series C junior subordinated debentures at the
time of redemption, purchase or defeasance, subject to certain limitations
described in the June 2007 RCC.

In
September 2007, FPL Group and FPL Group Capital executed a Replacement Capital
Covenant (September 2007 RCC) in connection with FPL Group Capital's offering of
$250 million principal amount of its Series D Junior Subordinated Debentures due
2067 and $350 million principal amount of Series E Junior Subordinated
Debentures due 2067 (collectively, Series D and Series E junior subordinated
debentures).  The September 2007 RCC is for the benefit of persons
that buy, hold or sell a specified series of covered debt of FPL Group Capital
(other than the Series D and Series E junior subordinated debentures) or, in
certain cases, of FPL Group. FPL Group Capital Trust I's 5 7/8% Preferred Trust
Securities have been initially designated as the covered debt under the
September 2007 RCC.  The September 2007 RCC provides that FPL Group
Capital may redeem, purchase, or defease, and FPL Group and any majority-owned
subsidiary of FPL Group or FPL Group Capital may purchase, any Series D and
Series E junior subordinated debentures on or before September 1, 2037, only to
the extent that the principal amount defeased or the applicable redemption or
purchase price does not exceed a specified amount raised from the issuance,
during the 180 days prior to the date of that redemption, purchase or
defeasance, of qualifying securities that have equity-like characteristics that
are the same as, or more equity-like than, the applicable characteristics of the
Series D and Series E junior subordinated debentures at the time of redemption,
purchase or defeasance, subject to certain limitations described in the
September 2007 RCC.

In March
2009, FPL Group and FPL Group Capital executed a Replacement Capital Covenant
(March 2009 RCC) in connection with FPL Group Capital's offering of $375 million
principal amount of its Series F Junior Subordinated Debentures due
2069.  The March 2009 RCC is for the benefit of persons that buy, hold
or sell a specified series of covered debt of FPL Group Capital (other than the
Series F junior subordinated debentures) or, in certain cases, of FPL Group. FPL
Group Capital Trust I's 5 7/8% Preferred Trust Securities have been initially
designated as the covered debt under the March 2009 RCC.  The March
2009 RCC provides that FPL Group Capital may redeem, purchase, or defease, and
FPL Group and any majority-owned subsidiary of FPL Group or FPL Group Capital
may purchase, any Series F junior subordinated debentures on or before
March 1, 2039, only to the extent that the principal amount defeased or the
applicable redemption or purchase price does not exceed a specified amount
raised from the issuance, during the 180 days prior to the date of that
redemption, purchase or defeasance, of qualifying securities that have
equity-like characteristics that are the same as, or more equity-like than, the
applicable characteristics of the Series F junior subordinated debentures at the
time of redemption, purchase or defeasance, subject to certain limitations
described in the March 2009 RCC.

New
Accounting Rules and Interpretations

Variable Interest Entities

-
In 2009, new accounting guidance was issued which modifies the consolidation
model in previous guidance and expands the required disclosures related to
VIEs.  The new accounting guidance became effective on January 1,
2010.  FPL Group and FPL are currently evaluating the impact of the
new accounting guidance.


Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

FPL
Group's and FPL's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States.  Critical accounting policies are those that FPL Group and FPL
believe are both most important to the portrayal of their financial condition
and results of operations, and require complex, subjective judgments, often as a
result of the need to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters
that are inherently uncertain.  Judgments and uncertainties affecting
the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts
being reported under different conditions or using different
assumptions.

FPL
Group and FPL consider the following policies to be the most critical in
understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing their consolidated
financial statements:

Accounting for Derivatives and
Hedging Activities

- FPL Group and FPL use derivative instruments
(primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the commodity price
risk inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity, as well as
interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with long-term
debt.  In addition, FPL Group, through NextEra Energy Resources, uses
derivatives to optimize the value of power generation assets.  NextEra
Energy Resources provides full energy and capacity requirements services
primarily to distribution utilities, which include load-following services and
various ancillary services, in certain markets and engages in power and gas
marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable
price movements.  Accounting pronouncements, which require the use of
fair value accounting if certain conditions are met, apply not only to
traditional financial derivative instruments, but to any contract having the
accounting characteristics of a derivative.

Derivative
instruments, when required to be marked to market, are recorded on the balance
sheet at fair value.  Fair values for some of the longer-term
contracts where liquid markets are not available are based on internally
developed models based on the forward prices for electricity and
fuel.  Forward prices represent the price at which a buyer or seller
could contract today to purchase or sell a commodity at a future
date.  In general, the models estimate the fair value of a contract by
calculating the present value of the difference between the contract price and
the forward prices.  The near term forward market for electricity is
generally liquid and therefore the prices in the early years of the forward
curves reflect observable market quotes.  However, in the later years,
the market is much less liquid and forward price curves must be developed using
factors including the forward prices for the commodities used as fuel to
generate electricity, the expected system heat rate (which measures the
efficiency of power plants in converting fuel to electricity) in the region
where the purchase or sale takes place, and a fundamental forecast of expected
spot prices based on modeled supply and demand in the region.  The
assumptions in these models are critical since any changes therein could have a
significant impact on the fair value of the contract.  Substantially
all changes in the fair value of derivatives held by FPL are deferred as a
regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled.  Upon
settlement, any gains or losses will be passed through the fuel or capacity
clauses.  In FPL Group's non-rate regulated operations, predominantly
NextEra Energy Resources, changes in derivative fair values are recognized in
current earnings, unless the criteria for hedge accounting are met and the
company elects to account for the derivative as a hedge.  For those
transactions accounted for as cash flow hedges, much of the effects of changes
in fair value are reflected in other comprehensive income (OCI), a component of
common shareholders' equity, rather than being recognized in current
earnings.  For those transactions accounted for as fair value hedges,
the effects of changes in fair value are reflected in current earnings offset by
changes in the fair value of the item being hedged.

Much of
the existing accounting guidance related to derivatives focuses on when certain
contracts for the purchase and sale of power and certain fuel supply contracts
can be excluded from derivative accounting rules, however the guidance does not
address all contract issues.  As a result, significant judgment must
be used in applying derivatives accounting guidance to contracts.  In
the event changes in interpretation occur, it is possible that contracts that
currently are excluded from derivatives accounting rules would have to be
recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in the fair value
recorded in the statement of income.

Certain
economic hedging transactions at NextEra Energy Resources do not meet the
requirements for hedge accounting treatment.  Changes in the fair
value of those transactions are marked to market and reported in the statement
of income, often resulting in earnings volatility.  These changes in
fair value are captured in the non-qualifying hedge category in computing
adjusted earnings.  This could be significant to NextEra Energy
Resources' results because often the economic offset to the positions which are
required to be marked to market (such as the physical assets from which power is
generated) are not marked to market.  As a consequence, net income
reflects only the movement in one part of economically linked
transactions.  Because of this, FPL Group's management views results
expressed excluding the unrealized mark-to-market impact of the non-qualifying
hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance.  For
additional information regarding derivative instruments, see Note 3 and
also see Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk
Sensitivity.


Accounting for Pensions and Other
Postretirement Benefits

-

FPL Group sponsors a
qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all
employees of FPL Group and its subsidiaries.  FPL Group also has a
supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) which includes a non-qualified
supplemental defined benefit pension component that provides benefits to a
select group of management and highly compensated employees.  The
impact of the SERP component is included within the pension plan as discussed
below.  In addition to pension benefits, FPL Group sponsors a
contributory postretirement plan for health care and life insurance benefits
(other benefits plan) for retirees of FPL Group and its subsidiaries meeting
certain eligibility requirements.  The qualified pension plan has a
fully funded trust dedicated to providing the benefits under the
plan.  The other benefits plan has a partially funded trust dedicated
to providing benefits related to life insurance.  FPL Group allocates
net periodic benefit income or cost associated with the pension and other
benefits plans to its subsidiaries annually using specific
criteria.

Effective
December 31, 2006, FPL Group adopted new recognition and disclosure
provisions regarding benefit plans which require recognition of the funded
status of benefit plans in the balance sheet, with changes in the funded status
recognized in comprehensive income within shareholders' equity in the year in
which the changes occur.  In addition, effective December 31,
2008, the new provisions required FPL Group to measure plan assets and benefit
obligations as of the fiscal year-end.  Prior to 2008, FPL Group used
a measurement date of September 30.  In lieu of remeasuring plan
assets and obligations as of January 1, 2008, FPL Group elected to calculate the
net periodic benefit (income) cost for the fifteen-month period from
September 30, 2007 to December 31, 2008 using the September 30,
2007 measurement date.  Upon adoption of the measurement date
provisions, FPL Group recorded an adjustment to increase 2008 beginning retained
earnings by approximately $13 million representing three-fifteenths of net
periodic benefit (income) cost for the fifteen-month period from
September 30, 2007 to December 31, 2008. Included in the adjustment to
retained earnings is approximately $1 million related to the reduction in
accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and approximately $3 million
related to the reduction in net regulatory liabilities.

Since
FPL Group is the plan sponsor, and its subsidiaries do not have separate rights
to the plan assets or direct obligations to their employees, the results of
implementing the new accounting provisions are reflected at FPL Group and not
allocated to the subsidiaries.  The portion of previously unrecognized
actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs or credits and transition
obligations related to the recognition provision that were estimated to be
allocable to FPL as net periodic benefit (income) cost in future periods and
that otherwise would have been recorded in AOCI were classified as regulatory
assets and liabilities at FPL Group in accordance with regulatory
treatment.  In addition, adjustments to AOCI as a result of
implementing the measurement date provisions that were estimated to be allocable
to FPL were recorded as an adjustment to the previously established regulatory
assets and liabilities.

FPL
Group's income from its pension plan, net of the cost of the other benefits
plan, was approximately $75 million, $86 million and $69 million for the years
ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  The
corresponding amounts allocated to FPL were $50 million, $60 million and $51
million, respectively.  Pension income and the cost of the other
benefits plan are included in O&M expenses, and are calculated using a
number of actuarial assumptions.  Those assumptions include an
expected long-term rate of return on qualified plan assets of 7.75% for all
years for the pension plan and 8.00% for all years for the other benefits plan,
assumed increases in salary of 4.00% for all years, and weighted-average
discount rates of 6.90%, 6.25% and 5.85% for the pension plan and 6.90%, 6.35%
and 5.90% for the other benefits plan for the years ended December 31,
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  Based on current health care costs
(as related to other benefits), the projected 2010 trend assumption used to
measure the expected cost of health care benefits covered by the plans for those
under age 65 is 8.00% for medical and 8.50% for prescription drug benefits and
for those age 65 and over is 7.50% for medical and 8.00% for prescription drug
benefits.  These rates are assumed to decrease over the next 9 years
for medical benefits and 11 years for prescription drug benefits to the ultimate
trend rate of 5.50% and remain at that level thereafter.  The ultimate
trend rate is assumed to be reached in 2018 for medical benefits and 2020 for
prescription drug benefits.  In developing these assumptions, FPL
Group evaluated input from its actuaries, as well as information available in
the marketplace.  For the expected long-term rate of return on fund
assets, FPL Group considered 10-year and 20-year historical median returns for a
portfolio with an equity/bond asset mix similar to its funds, as well as its
funds' historical compounded returns.  FPL Group also considered input
from its actuaries and consultants, as well as information available in the
marketplace.  FPL Group believes that 7.75% and 8.00% are reasonable
long-term rates of return on its pension plan and other benefits plan assets,
respectively.  FPL Group will continue to evaluate all of its
actuarial assumptions, including its expected rate of return, at least annually,
and will adjust them as necessary.

FPL
Group bases its determination of pension and other benefits plan expense or
income on a market-related valuation of assets, which reduces year-to-year
volatility.  This market-related valuation recognizes investment gains
or losses over a five-year period following the year in which they
occur.  Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference
between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets
and the actual return realized on those assets.  Since the
market-related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five-year
period, the future value of assets will be affected as previously deferred gains
or losses are recognized.  Such gains and losses together with other
differences between actual results and the estimates used in the actuarial
valuations are deferred and recognized in determining pension and other benefits
plan expense and income only to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of
projected benefit obligations or the market-related value of
assets.


The
following table illustrates the effect on net periodic benefit income of
changing the critical actuarial assumptions discussed above, while holding all
other assumptions constant:

¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾

(a)

Assumed
      health care cost trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts
      reported for postretirement plans providing health care
      benefits.  However, this effect is somewhat mitigated by the
      retiree cost sharing structure incorporated in FPL Group's other benefits
      plan.

The fair
value of plan assets has increased from $2.5 billion at December 31, 2008
to $3.0 billion at December 31, 2009 for the pension plan and increased
from $29 million at December 31, 2008 to $32 million at December 31,
2009 for the other benefits plan.  Management believes that, based on
the actuarial assumptions and the well funded status of the pension plan, FPL
Group will not be required to make any cash contributions to the qualified
pension plan in the near future.  In December 2009, $29 million was
transferred from the qualified pension plan as reimbursement for eligible
retiree medical expenses paid by FPL Group during the year pursuant to the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.  FPL Group anticipates paying
approximately $29 million for eligible retiree medical expenses on behalf of the
other benefits plan during 2010 with substantially all of that amount being
reimbursed through a transfer of assets from the qualified pension
plan.  See Note 2.

Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets

-

FPL Group
evaluates on an ongoing basis the recoverability of its assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
may not be recoverable.

An
impairment loss is required to be recognized if the carrying value of the asset
exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows associated with that
asset.  The impairment loss to be recognized is the amount by which
the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds the asset's fair
value.  In most instances, the fair value is determined by discounting
estimated future cash flows using an appropriate interest rate.

The
amount of future net cash flows, the timing of the cash flows and the
determination of an appropriate interest rate all involve estimates and
judgments about future events.  In particular, the aggregate amount of
cash flows determines whether an impairment exists, and the timing of the cash
flows is critical in determining fair value.  Because each assessment
is based on the facts and circumstances associated with each long-lived asset,
the effects of changes in assumptions cannot be generalized.

Nuclear Decommissioning and Fossil
Dismantlement

- FPL Group and FPL each account for asset retirement
obligations and conditional asset retirement obligations (collectively, AROs)
under accounting guidance that requires a liability for the fair value of an ARO
be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if it can be reasonably
estimated, with the offsetting associated asset retirement costs capitalized as
part of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets.  See Note 1
- - Asset Retirement Obligations, Note 1 - Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants,
Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs and
Note 13.

For
ratemaking purposes, FPL accrues and funds for nuclear plant decommissioning
costs over the expected service life of each unit based on studies that are
filed with the FPSC at least every five years.  The most recent
studies, filed in 2005, indicate that FPL's portion of the future cost of
decommissioning its four nuclear units, including spent fuel storage, is
approximately $10.9 billion, or $2.4 billion in 2009 dollars.  The
studies reflect, among other things, the 20-year license extensions of FPL's
nuclear units.  At December 31, 2009, $2,597 million was accrued
for nuclear decommissioning, of which $1,807 million was recorded as an ARO, $50
million was recorded as a capitalized net asset related to the ARO, $644 million
was recorded as a regulatory liability and $196 million was included in accrued
asset removal costs (a regulatory liability) on the consolidated balance
sheets.

FPL
accrues the cost of dismantling its fossil plants over the expected service life
of each unit based on studies filed with the FPSC.  Unlike nuclear
decommissioning, fossil dismantlement costs are not funded.  The most
recent studies, which became effective January 1, 2010, indicated that
FPL's portion of the ultimate cost to dismantle its fossil units is $894
million, or $467 million expressed in 2009 dollars.  The majority of
the dismantlement costs are not considered AROs.  At December 31,
2009, $364 million was accrued for fossil dismantlement costs, of which $23
million was recorded as an ARO, $5 million was recorded as a capitalized net
asset related to the ARO, $28 million was recorded as a regulatory liability and
$318 million was included in accrued asset removal costs (a regulatory
liability) on the consolidated balance sheets.


NextEra
Energy Resources records a liability for the present value of its expected
decommissioning costs which is determined using various internal and external
data.  NextEra Energy Resources' portion of the ultimate cost of
decommissioning its nuclear plants, including costs associated with spent fuel
storage, is estimated to be approximately $6.6 billion, or $1.6 billion
expressed in 2009 dollars.  The liability is being accreted using the
interest method through the date decommissioning activities are expected to be
complete.  At December 31, 2009, the ARO for nuclear
decommissioning of NextEra Energy Resources' nuclear plants totaled
approximately $518 million.

The
calculation of the future cost of retiring long-lived assets, including nuclear
decommissioning and fossil dismantlement costs, involves estimating the amount
and timing of future expenditures and making judgments concerning whether or not
such costs are considered a legal obligation.  Estimating the amount
and timing of future expenditures includes, among other things, making
projections of when assets will be retired and how costs will escalate with
inflation.  In addition, FPL Group and FPL also make interest rate and
rate of return projections on their investments in determining recommended
funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning costs.  Periodically,
FPL Group and FPL will be required to update these estimates and projections
which can affect the annual expense amounts recognized, the liabilities recorded
and the annual funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning
costs.  For example, an increase of 0.25% in the assumed escalation
rates would increase FPL Group's and FPL's ARO as of December 31, 2009 by
$235 million and $183 million, respectively.

Regulatory Accounting

-

Accounting guidance
allows regulators to create assets and impose liabilities that would not be
recorded by non-rate regulated entities.  Regulatory assets and
liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or
refunded to customers through the ratemaking process.  If FPL were no
longer subject to cost-based rate regulation, the existing regulatory assets and
liabilities would be written off unless regulators specify an alternative means
of recovery or refund.  In addition, the FPSC has the authority to
disallow recovery of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently
incurred.  Such costs may include, among others, fuel and O&M
expenses, the cost of replacing power lost when fossil and nuclear units are
unavailable, storm restoration costs and costs associated with the construction
or acquisition of new facilities.  The continued applicability of
regulatory accounting is assessed at each reporting period.

Energy
Marketing and Trading and Market Risk Sensitivity

Energy Marketing and Trading

- - Certain of FPL Group's subsidiaries, including FPL and NextEra Energy
Resources, use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and
forwards) to manage the commodity price risk inherent in the purchase and sale
of fuel and electricity.  In addition, FPL Group, through NextEra
Energy Resources, uses derivatives to optimize the value of power generation
assets.  NextEra Energy Resources provides full energy and capacity
requirements services primarily to distribution utilities, which include
load-following services and various ancillary services, in certain markets and
engages in power and gas marketing and trading activities to take advantage of
expected future favorable price movements.

Derivative
instruments, when required to be marked to market, are recorded on FPL Group's
and FPL's consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability measured
at fair value.  At FPL, substantially all changes in fair value are
deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled,
and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause or
the capacity clause.  For FPL Group's non-rate regulated operations,
predominantly NextEra Energy Resources, essentially all changes in the
derivatives' fair value for power purchases and sales and trading activities are
recognized on a net basis in operating revenues; fuel purchases and sales are
recognized on a net basis in fuel, purchased power and interchange expense; and
the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in
earnings of equity method investees in FPL Group's consolidated statements of
income unless hedge accounting is applied.  See
Note 3.

The
changes in the fair value of FPL Group's consolidated subsidiaries' energy
contract derivative instruments were as follows:

Market Risk Sensitivity

-
Financial instruments and positions affecting the financial statements of FPL
Group and FPL described below are held primarily for purposes other than
trading.  Market risk is measured as the potential loss in fair value
resulting from hypothetical reasonably possible changes in commodity prices,
interest rates, equity prices or currency exchange rates over the next
year.  In 2008, FPL Group Capital entered into a cross currency basis
swap to hedge against currency movements with respect to both interest and
principal payments on a loan and, in June 2009, FPL Group Capital entered into a
cross currency swap to hedge against currency and interest rate movements with
respect to both interest and principal payments on a loan.  At
December 31, 2009 and 2008, the fair value of these cross currency swaps
was not material.  Management has established risk management policies
to monitor and manage market risks.  With respect to commodities, FPL
Group's Exposure Management Committee (EMC), which is comprised of certain
members of senior management, is responsible for the overall approval of market
risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization
levels.  The EMC receives periodic updates on market positions and
related exposures, credit exposures and overall risk management
activities.

FPL
Group and its subsidiaries are also exposed to credit risk through their energy
marketing and trading operations.  Credit risk is the risk that a
financial loss will be incurred if a counterparty to a transaction does not
fulfill its financial obligation.  FPL Group manages counterparty
credit risk for its subsidiaries with energy marketing and trading operations
through established policies, including counterparty credit limits, and in some
cases credit enhancements, such as cash prepayments, letters of credit, cash and
other collateral and guarantees.  Credit risk is also managed through
the use of master netting agreements.  FPL Group's credit department
monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their
affiliates, both on an individual and an aggregate basis.

Commodity
price risk - FPL Group uses a value-at-risk (VaR) model to measure market risk
in its trading and mark-to-market portfolios.  The VaR is the
estimated nominal loss of market value based on a one-day holding period at a
95% confidence level using historical simulation methodology.  As of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, the VaR figures are as follows:

¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾

(a)

Non-qualifying
      hedges are employed to reduce the market risk exposure to physical assets
      or contracts which are not marked to market.  The VaR figures
      for the non-qualifying hedges and hedges in OCI and FPL cost recovery
      clauses category do not represent the economic exposure to commodity price
      movements.

Interest
rate risk - FPL Group and FPL are exposed to risk resulting from changes in
interest rates as a result of their respective issuances of debt, investments in
special use funds and other investments.  FPL Group and FPL manage
their respective interest rate exposure by monitoring current interest rates,
entering into interest rate swaps and adjusting their variable rate debt in
relation to total capitalization.

The
special use funds of FPL Group and FPL consist of restricted funds set aside to
cover the cost of storm damage for FPL and for the decommissioning of FPL
Group's and FPL's nuclear power plants.  A portion of these funds is
invested in fixed income debt securities carried at their market
value.  At FPL, adjustments to market value result in a corresponding
adjustment to the related liability accounts based on current regulatory
treatment.  The market value adjustments of FPL Group's non-rate
regulated operations result in a corresponding adjustment to OCI, except for
impairments deemed to be other than temporary which are reported in current
period earnings.  Because the funds set aside by FPL for storm damage
could be needed at any time, the related investments are generally more liquid
and, therefore, are less sensitive to changes in interest rates.  The
nuclear decommissioning funds, in contrast, are generally invested in
longer-term securities, as decommissioning activities are not scheduled to begin
until at least 2014 (2032 at FPL).

FPL
Group and its subsidiaries use a combination of fixed rate and variable rate
debt to manage interest rate exposure.  Interest rate swaps are used
to mitigate and adjust interest rate exposure when deemed appropriate based upon
market conditions or when required by financing agreements.  At
December 31, 2009, the estimated fair value for FPL Group's interest rate
swaps was as follows:

¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾

Based
upon a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates, which is a reasonable
near-term market change, the net fair value of FPL Group's net liabilities would
increase by approximately $828 million ($325 million for FPL) at
December 31, 2009.


Equity
price risk - Included in the nuclear decommissioning reserve funds of FPL Group
are marketable equity securities carried at their market value of approximately
$1,705 million and $1,080 million ($1,024 million and $648 million for FPL) at
December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  A hypothetical 10%
decrease in the prices quoted by stock exchanges, which is a reasonable
near-term market change, would result in a $157 million ($94 million for FPL)
reduction in fair value and corresponding adjustments to the related liability
accounts based on current regulatory treatment for FPL, or adjustments to OCI
for FPL Group's non-rate regulated operations, at December 31,
2009.

Credit
risk - For all derivative and contractual transactions, FPL Group's energy
marketing and trading operations, which includes FPL's energy marketing and
trading division, are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by
counterparties to these transactions.  Relevant considerations when
assessing FPL Group's energy marketing and trading operations' credit risk
exposure include:

·

Operations
      are primarily concentrated in the energy
  industry.

·

Trade
      receivables and other financial instruments are predominately with energy,
      utility and financial services related companies, as well as
      municipalities, cooperatives and other trading companies in the United
      States.

·

Overall
      credit risk is managed through established credit
  policies.

·

Prospective
      and existing customers are reviewed for creditworthiness based upon
      established standards, with customers not meeting minimum standards
      providing various credit enhancements or secured payment terms, such as
      letters of credit or the posting of margin cash
  collateral.

·

The
      use of master netting agreements to offset cash and non-cash gains and
      losses arising from derivative instruments with the same
      counterparty.  FPL Group's policy is to have master netting
      agreements in place with significant
  counterparties.

Based on
FPL Group's policies and risk exposures related to credit, FPL Group and FPL do
not anticipate a material adverse effect on their financial positions as a
result of counterparty nonperformance.  As of December 31, 2009,
approximately 98% of FPL Group's and 100% of FPL's energy marketing and trading
counterparty credit risk exposure is associated with companies that have
investment grade credit ratings.

MANAGEMENT'S
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

FPL
Group, Inc.'s (FPL Group) and Florida Power & Light Company's (FPL)
management are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The consolidated financial
statements, which in part are based on informed judgments and estimates made by
management, have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a consistent basis.

To aid
in carrying out this responsibility, we, along with all other members of
management, maintain a system of internal accounting control which is
established after weighing the cost of such controls against the benefits
derived.  In the opinion of management, the overall system of internal
accounting control provides reasonable assurance that the assets of FPL Group
and FPL and their subsidiaries are safeguarded and that transactions are
executed in accordance with management's authorization and are properly recorded
for the preparation of financial statements.  In addition, management
believes the overall system of internal accounting control provides reasonable
assurance that material errors or irregularities would be prevented or detected
on a timely basis by employees in the normal course of their
duties.  Any system of internal accounting control, no matter how well
designed, has inherent limitations, including the possibility that controls can
be circumvented or overridden and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur
and not be detected.  Also, because of changes in conditions, internal
control effectiveness may vary over time.  Accordingly, even an
effective system of internal control will provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation and reporting.

The
system of internal accounting control is supported by written policies and
guidelines, the selection and training of qualified employees, an organizational
structure that provides an appropriate division of responsibility and a program
of internal auditing.  FPL Group's written policies include a Code of
Business Conduct & Ethics that states management's policy on conflict of
interest and ethical conduct.  Compliance with the Code of Business
Conduct & Ethics is confirmed annually by key personnel.

The
Board of Directors pursues its oversight responsibility for financial reporting
and accounting through its Audit Committee.  This Committee, which is
comprised entirely of outside directors, meets regularly with management, the
internal auditors and the independent auditors to make inquiries as to the
manner in which the responsibilities of each are being
discharged.  The independent auditors and the internal audit staff
have free access to the Committee without management's presence to discuss
auditing, internal accounting control and financial reporting
matters.

Management
assessed the effectiveness of FPL Group's and FPL's internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, using the criteria set forth
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in the
Internal Control - Integrated Framework.  Based on this assessment,
management believes that FPL Group's and FPL's internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 31, 2009.

FPL
Group's and FPL's independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte &
Touche LLP, is engaged to express an opinion on FPL Group's and FPL's
consolidated financial statements and an opinion on FPL Group's and FPL's
internal control over financial reporting.  Their reports are based on
procedures believed by them to provide a reasonable basis to support such
opinions.  These reports appear on the following pages.

Treadway Commission. FPL Group's and FPL’s management are responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for their
assessments of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on FPL Group’s
and FPL’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or
under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the
company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's
assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of
controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

In our
opinion, FPL Group and FPL maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.

We have
also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2009 of FPL Group and FPL and our report
dated February 25, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial
statements.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the
Board of Directors and Shareholders

FPL
Group, Inc. and Florida Power & Light Company:

We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of FPL Group, Inc. and
subsidiaries (FPL Group) and the separate consolidated balance sheets of Florida
Power & Light Company and subsidiaries (FPL) as of December 31, 2009
and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of income, FPL Group’s common
shareholders' equity, FPL’s common shareholder’s equity and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the respective company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our
opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of FPL Group and FPL at December 31, 2009
and 2008, and the respective results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

We have
also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), FPL Group’s and FPL’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the criteria
established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25,
2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on FPL Group’s and FPL’s internal control
over financial reporting.

FPL
GROUP, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY

NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Years
Ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007

1.  Summary
of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies

Basis of Presentation

- FPL
Group, Inc.'s (FPL Group) operations are conducted primarily through its
wholly-owned subsidiary Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) and its
wholly-owned indirect subsidiary NextEra Energy Resources, LLC (NextEra Energy
Resources) formerly known as FPL Energy, LLC.  FPL, a rate-regulated
public utility, supplies electric service to approximately 4.5 million customer
accounts throughout most of the east and lower west coasts of
Florida.  NextEra Energy Resources invests in independent power
projects through both controlled and consolidated entities and non-controlling
ownership interests in joint ventures essentially all of which are accounted for
under the equity method.

The
consolidated financial statements of FPL Group and FPL include the accounts of
their respective majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries.  All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.  Certain amounts included in prior years' consolidated
financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year's
presentation.  The preparation of financial statements requires the
use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Regulation

- FPL is subject
to regulation by the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) and the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).  Its rates are designed to
recover the cost of providing electric service to its customers including a
reasonable rate of return on invested capital.  As a result of this
cost-based regulation, FPL follows the accounting guidance that allows
regulators to create assets and impose liabilities that would not be recorded by
non-rate regulated entities.  Regulatory assets and liabilities
represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to
customers through the ratemaking process.

Cost
recovery clauses, which are designed to permit full recovery of certain costs
and provide a return on certain assets allowed to be recovered through the
various clauses, include substantially all fuel, purchased power and interchange
expenses, conservation and certain environmental-related expenses, certain
revenue taxes and franchise fees.  Beginning in 2009, pre-construction
costs and carrying charges on construction costs for new nuclear capacity and
costs incurred for FPL's solar generating facilities are also recovered through
cost recovery clauses.  Revenues from cost recovery clauses are
recorded when billed; FPL achieves matching of costs and related revenues by
deferring the net underrecovery or overrecovery.  Any underrecovered
costs or overrecovered revenues are collected from or returned to customers in
subsequent periods.  Pursuant to an FPSC order, FPL was required to
refund in the form of a one-time credit to retail customers' bills the 2009
year-end estimated fuel overrecovery; in January 2010, approximately $403
million was refunded to retail customers.  At December 31, 2009,
approximately $356 million of retail fuel revenues were
overrecovered.  The difference between the refund and the
December 31, 2009 overrecovery will be collected from retail customers in a
subsequent period.

If FPL
were no longer subject to cost-based rate regulation, the existing regulatory
assets and liabilities would be written off unless regulators specify an
alternative means of recovery or refund.  In addition, the FPSC has
the authority to disallow recovery of costs that it considers excessive or
imprudently incurred.  The continued applicability of regulatory
accounting is assessed at each reporting period.

Revenues and Rates

- FPL's
retail and wholesale utility rate schedules are approved by the FPSC and the
FERC, respectively.  FPL records unbilled base revenues for the
estimated amount of energy delivered to customers but not yet
billed.  Unbilled base revenues are included in customer receivables
and amounted to approximately $121 million and $114 million at December 31,
2009 and 2008, respectively.  FPL's operating revenues also include
amounts resulting from cost recovery clauses (see Regulation), franchise fees,
gross receipts taxes and surcharges related to the recovery of storm restoration
costs associated with hurricanes and storm-recovery bonds (see Note 9 -
FPL).  Franchise fees and gross receipts taxes are imposed on FPL;
however, the FPSC allows FPL to include in the amounts charged to customers the
amount of the gross receipts tax for all customers and the franchise amount for
those customers located in the jurisdiction that imposes the
fee.  Accordingly, franchise fees and gross receipts taxes are
reported gross in operating revenues and taxes other than income taxes and other
on FPL Group's and FPL's consolidated statements of income and were
approximately $791 million, $781 million and $755 million in 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively.  FPL also collects municipal utility taxes which
are reported gross in customer receivables and accounts payable on FPL Group's
and FPL's consolidated balance sheets.


In
January 2010, the FPSC orally ruled with respect to FPL's March 2009 petition
(January 2010 rate ruling) and indicated that the ruling would be reflected in a
final written order to be issued in February 2010 (final order).  The
January 2010 rate ruling indicated that new retail base rates would be
established for FPL effective March 1, 2010, would increase retail base rates by
approximately $75 million on an annualized basis, would establish a regulatory
return on common equity (ROE) of 10.0% with a range of plus or minus 100 basis
points and would shift certain costs from retail base rates to the capacity cost
recovery clause (capacity clause).  The January 2010 rate ruling also
indicated that depreciation expense would be reduced over the next four
years.  See Electric Plant, Depreciation and
Amortization.  As of the date of this report, the final order remains
pending.  Upon issuance of the final order, parties have the right to
file motions with the FPSC for reconsideration of some or all of the final
order, or to appeal some or all of the final order to the Florida Supreme
Court.  In response to inquiries regarding potential inconsistencies
in calculations underlying the January 2010 rate ruling, staff for the FPSC has
indicated it would address any matters raised by the parties before the final
order following the filing of any motions for reconsideration.  FPL
cannot predict the specific treatment of any particular issue in the final
order.

FPL is
evaluating the impact of the January 2010 rate ruling on its financial position,
including its credit quality and ability to attract capital over the long
term.  FPL has suspended activities on the following projects
representing approximately $10 billion of investment over the next five years
until the financial impact of the final order, along with other factors, such as
load-growth estimates, fuel cost forecasts, demand side management and
environmental incentives, can be reviewed (see Note 14 -
Commitments):

FPL is
also evaluating its options with respect to future regulatory actions regarding
the January 2010 rate ruling and, when it is issued, the final order, as well as
assessing the cost structure of its ongoing operations and reviewing other
planned capital expenditures for appropriate reductions.

Under a
rate agreement approved in 2005 (2005 rate agreement), retail base rates did not
increase except to allow recovery of the revenue requirements of FPL's three
power plants that achieved commercial operation during the term of the 2005 rate
agreement.  Retail base rates increased when Turkey Point Unit No. 5
was placed in service in 2007 and when West County Energy Center (WCEC) Units
Nos. 1 and 2 were placed in service in 2009.  During the term of
the 2005 rate agreement, FPL did not have an authorized regulatory ROE for the
purpose of addressing earnings levels; however, for all other regulatory
purposes, FPL had an ROE of 11.75%.  Under the terms of the 2005 rate
agreement, FPL's electric property depreciation rates were based upon the
comprehensive depreciation studies it filed with the FPSC in March 2005;
however, FPL reduced depreciation on its plant in service by $125 million each
year, as allowed by the 2005 rate agreement.  The 2005 rate agreement
also provided for a revenue sharing mechanism, whereby revenues from retail base
operations in excess of certain thresholds would be shared with
customers.  During the term of the 2005 rate agreement, FPL's revenues
did not exceed the thresholds.

NextEra
Energy Resources' revenue is recorded as electricity is delivered, which is when
revenue is earned.  NextEra Energy Resources' retail energy business
records unbilled revenues for the estimated amount of energy delivered to
customers but not yet billed.  Unbilled revenues are included in
customer receivables and amounted to approximately $47 million and $41 million
at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Electric Plant, Depreciation and
Amortization

- The cost of additions to units of property of FPL and
NextEra Energy Resources is added to electric utility plant.  In
accordance with regulatory accounting, the cost of FPL's units of utility
property retired, less estimated net salvage value, is charged to accumulated
depreciation.  Maintenance and repairs of property as well as
replacements and renewals of items determined to be less than units of utility
property are charged to other operations and maintenance (O&M)
expenses.  At December 31, 2009, the electric generating,
transmission, distribution and general facilities of FPL represented
approximately 46%, 13%, 37% and 4%, respectively, of FPL's gross investment in
electric utility plant in service.  Substantially all of FPL's
properties are subject to the lien of FPL's mortgage, which secures most debt
securities issued by FPL.  A number of NextEra Energy Resources'
generating facilities are encumbered by liens against their assets securing
various financings.  The net book value of NextEra Energy Resources'
assets serving as collateral was approximately $6 billion at December 31,
2009.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided for
an option to elect a cash grant (convertible ITCs) for certain renewable energy
property (renewable property).  Convertible ITCs are recorded as a
reduction in property, plant and equipment on FPL Group's and FPL's consolidated
balance sheets and are amortized as a reduction to depreciation and amortization
expense over the estimated life of the related property.  At
December 31, 2009, FPL Group recorded convertible ITCs of approximately
$417 million ($44 million at FPL), which are included in other receivables on
FPL Group’s and FPL’s consolidated balance sheets.


Depreciation
of FPL's electric property is primarily provided on a straight-line average
remaining life basis.  FPL includes in depreciation expense a
provision for fossil plant dismantlement, nuclear plant decommissioning (see
Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued
Asset Removal Costs) and amortization of pre-construction costs associated with
planned nuclear units recovered through a cost recovery clause.  For
substantially all of FPL's property, depreciation studies are performed and
filed with the FPSC at least every four years.  Under the terms of the
2005 rate agreement, FPL's electric property depreciation rates were based upon
the comprehensive depreciation studies it filed with the FPSC in March 2005;
however FPL reduced depreciation by $125 million annually as allowed by the 2005
rate agreement.  The weighted annual composite depreciation rate for
FPL's electric plant in service, including capitalized software, but excluding
the effects of decommissioning, dismantlement and the depreciation adjustments
discussed above, was approximately 3.6% for each of the years 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively.  As part of the January 2010 rate ruling, the FPSC
approved new depreciation rates which became effective January 1,
2010.  These new rates are expected to decrease depreciation
expense.  The January 2010 rate ruling also requires FPL to reduce
depreciation expense over the next four years related to a depreciation reserve
surplus totaling approximately $895 million.  NextEra Energy
Resources' electric plants in service less salvage value, if any, are
depreciated primarily using the straight-line method over their estimated useful
lives.  NextEra Energy Resources' effective depreciation rates,
excluding decommissioning, were 4.2%, 4.3% and 4.4% for 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

Nuclear Fuel

- FPL leases
nuclear fuel for all four of its nuclear units.  FPL Group and FPL
consolidate the lessor entity, a variable interest entity.  See
Note 9 - FPL.

NextEra
Energy Resources' nuclear units have several contracts for the supply,
conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel.  See
Note 14 - Contracts.  NextEra Energy Resources' nuclear fuel
costs are charged to fuel expense on a unit of production method.

Construction Activity

-
Allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) is a non-cash item which
represents the allowed cost of capital, including an ROE, used to finance FPL
construction projects.  The portion of AFUDC attributable to borrowed
funds is recorded as a reduction of interest expense and the remainder is
recorded as other income.  FPSC rules limit the recording of AFUDC to
projects that cost in excess of 0.5% of a utility's plant in service balance and
require more than one year to complete.  FPSC rules allow construction
projects below the 0.5% threshold as a component of rate base.  During
2009, 2008 and 2007, AFUDC was capitalized at a rate of 7.41%, 7.65% and 7.42%,
respectively, and amounted to approximately $74 million, $53 million and $36
million, respectively.  See Note 14 - Commitments.

FPL's
construction work in progress includes construction materials, progress payments
on major equipment contracts, third-party engineering costs, AFUDC and other
costs directly associated with the construction of various
projects.  Upon completion of the projects, these costs are
transferred to electric utility plant in service.  At
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, FPL recorded approximately $295 million,
$194 million and $188 million, respectively, of construction-related accruals,
which are included in other current liabilities, and approximately $123 million,
$121 million and $107 million, respectively, of construction-related accounts
payable, which are included in accounts payable on FPL Group's and FPL's
consolidated balance sheets.  Capitalized costs associated with
construction activities are charged to O&M expenses when recoverability is
no longer probable.  See Regulation above for information on recovery
of costs associated with new nuclear capacity and solar generating
facilities.

NextEra
Energy Resources capitalizes project development costs once it is probable that
such costs will be realized through the ultimate construction of a power plant
or sale of development rights.  At December 31, 2009 and 2008,
NextEra Energy Resources' capitalized development costs totaled approximately
$56 million and $40 million, respectively, which are included in other assets on
FPL Group's consolidated balance sheets.  These costs include land
rights and other third-party costs directly associated with the development of a
new project.  Upon commencement of construction, these costs either
are transferred to construction work in progress or remain in other assets,
depending upon the nature of the cost.  Capitalized development costs
are charged to O&M expenses when recoverability is no longer
probable.

NextEra
Energy Resources' construction work in progress includes construction materials,
prepayments on turbine generators and other equipment, third-party engineering
costs, capitalized interest and other costs directly associated with the
construction and development of the project.  Interest capitalized on
construction projects amounted to $85 million, $55 million and $39 million
during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  NextEra Energy Resources'
interest expense is based on a deemed capital structure of 50% debt for
operating projects and 100% debt for projects under
construction.  Upon commencement of plant operation, costs associated
with construction work in progress are transferred to electric utility plant in
service and other property.  At December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
NextEra Energy Resources recorded approximately $175 million, $74 million and
$106 million, respectively, of construction-related accruals, which are included
in other current liabilities, and approximately $90 million, $59 million and
$102 million, respectively, of construction-related accounts payable which are
included in accounts payable on FPL Group's consolidated balance
sheets.


Asset Retirement Obligations

- FPL Group and FPL each account for asset retirement obligations and
conditional asset retirement obligations (collectively, AROs) under accounting
guidance that requires a liability for the fair value of an ARO be recognized in
the period in which it is incurred if it can be reasonably estimated, with the
offsetting associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying
amount of the long-lived assets.  The asset retirement cost is
subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over
the asset’s estimated useful life.  Changes in the ARO resulting from
the passage of time are recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the
liability and as accretion expense, which is included in depreciation and
amortization expense in the consolidated statements of
income.  Changes resulting from revisions to the timing or amount of
the original estimate of cash flows are recognized as an increase or a decrease
in the asset retirement cost and ARO.  See Note 13.

Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants,
Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs

- The
components of FPL Group's and FPL's decommissioning of nuclear plants,
dismantlement of plants and other accrued asset removal costs are as

(b)

Represents
      total amount accrued for ratemaking
purposes.

FPL -
For ratemaking purposes, FPL accrues for the cost of end of life retirement and
disposal of its nuclear and fossil plants over the expected service life of each
unit based on nuclear decommissioning and fossil dismantlement studies
periodically filed with the FPSC.  In addition, FPL accrues for
interim removal costs over the life of the related assets based on depreciation
studies approved by the FPSC.  In 2005, FPL suspended its annual
decommissioning accrual as approved by the FPSC.  For financial
reporting purposes, FPL recognizes decommissioning and dismantlement liabilities
in accordance with accounting guidance that requires a liability for the fair
value of an ARO be recognized in the period in which it is
incurred.  Any differences between expense recognized for financial
reporting purposes and the amount recoverable through rates are reported as a
regulatory liability in accordance with regulatory accounting.  See
Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization, Asset Retirement Obligations and
Note 13.

Nuclear
decommissioning studies are performed at least every five years and are
submitted to the FPSC for approval.  FPL filed updated nuclear
decommissioning studies with the FPSC in December 2005.  These studies
reflect FPL's current plans, under the operating licenses, for prompt
dismantlement of Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 following the end of plant
operation with decommissioning activities commencing in 2032 and 2033,
respectively, and provide for St. Lucie Unit No. 1 to be mothballed
beginning in 2036 with decommissioning activities to be integrated with the
prompt dismantlement of St. Lucie Unit No. 2 at the end of its useful life
in 2043.  These studies also assume that FPL will be storing spent
fuel on site pending removal to a U.S. government facility.  The
studies indicate FPL's portion of the ultimate costs of decommissioning its four
nuclear units, including costs associated with spent fuel storage, to be
approximately $10.9 billion.  FPL's portion of the ultimate cost of
decommissioning its four units, expressed in 2009 dollars, is estimated by the
studies to aggregate $2.4 billion.

Restricted
funds for the payment of future expenditures to decommission FPL's nuclear units
are included in nuclear decommissioning reserve funds, which are included in
special use funds on FPL Group's and FPL's consolidated balance
sheets.  Consistent with regulatory treatment, marketable securities
held in the decommissioning funds are classified as available for sale and are
carried at market value with market adjustments, including any other than
temporary impairment losses, resulting in a corresponding adjustment to the
related regulatory liability accounts.  See
Note 5.  Contributions to the funds were suspended in
2005.  Fund earnings, net of taxes, are reinvested in the
funds.  Earnings are recognized as income/loss and an offset is
recorded to reflect a corresponding increase/decrease in the related regulatory
liability accounts.  As a result, there is no effect on net
income.  During 2009, 2008 and 2007, fund earnings on decommissioning
funds were approximately $81 million, $63 million and $81 million,
respectively.  The tax effects of amounts not yet recognized for tax
purposes are included in accumulated deferred income taxes.


Fossil
fuel plant dismantlement studies are performed at least every four years and are
submitted to the FPSC for approval.  FPL's latest fossil fuel plant
dismantlement studies became effective January 1, 2010 and resulted in an
increase in the annual expense from $15 million to $19 million.  The
studies indicate that FPL's portion of the ultimate cost to dismantle its fossil
units is $894 million, or $467 million expressed in 2009
dollars.  During both 2009 and 2008, with respect to costs associated
with fossil dismantlement, FPL recognized approximately $2 million related to
ARO accretion expense and depreciation of the capitalized ARO asset and
approximately $13 million related to the non-legal obligation included in
accrued asset removal costs, which equaled the $15 million accrual approved by
the FPSC for dismantlement expense (included in depreciation and amortization
expense in FPL Group's and FPL's consolidated statements of
income).  During 2007, with respect to costs associated with fossil
dismantlement, FPL recognized approximately $2 million related to ARO accretion
expense and depreciation of the capitalized ARO asset, approximately $14 million
related to the non-legal obligation included in accrued asset removal costs and
approximately $1 million credit to adjust the total accrual to the $15 million
approved by the FPSC for dismantlement expense (included in depreciation and
amortization expense in FPL Group's and FPL's consolidated statements of
income).

NextEra
Energy Resources - NextEra Energy Resources records nuclear decommissioning
liabilities for Seabrook Station (Seabrook), Duane Arnold Energy Center (Duane
Arnold) and Point Beach Nuclear Power Plant (Point Beach) in accordance with
accounting guidance that requires a liability for the fair value of an ARO be
recognized in the period in which it is incurred.  See
Note 13.  At December 31, 2009 and 2008, NextEra Energy
Resources' ARO related to nuclear decommissioning totaled approximately $518
million and $487 million, respectively, and was determined using various
internal and external data.  NextEra Energy Resources' portion of the
ultimate cost of decommissioning its nuclear plants, including costs associated
with spent fuel storage, is estimated to be approximately $6.6 billion, or $1.6
billion expressed in 2009 dollars.  The liability is being accreted
using the interest method through the date decommissioning activities are
expected to be complete.

Seabrook's
decommissioning funding plan is based on a comprehensive nuclear decommissioning
study filed with the New Hampshire Nuclear Decommissioning Financing Committee
(NDFC) in 2007 and is effective for four years.  There are ongoing
minimum decommissioning funding requirements for Duane Arnold and Point Beach
with the NRC, which NextEra Energy Resources either meets or intends to meet in
the form of a guarantee for each plant.  NextEra Energy Resources'
portion of Seabrook's, Duane Arnold's and Point Beach's restricted funds for the
payment of future expenditures to decommission these plants is included in
nuclear decommissioning reserve funds, which are included in special use funds
on FPL Group's consolidated balance sheets.  Marketable securities
held in the decommissioning funds are classified as available for sale and are
carried at market value.  Market adjustments result in a corresponding
adjustment to other comprehensive income (OCI), except for unrealized losses
associated with marketable securities considered to be other than temporary,
including any credit losses, which are recognized as an expense in FPL Group's
consolidated statements of income.  Fund earnings are recognized in
income and are reinvested in the funds either on a pretax or after-tax
basis.  See Note 5.  The tax effects of amounts not yet
recognized for tax purposes are included in accumulated deferred income
taxes.

Major Maintenance Costs

- FPL
uses the accrue-in-advance method for recognizing costs associated with planned
major nuclear maintenance, in accordance with regulatory treatment, and records
the related accrual as a regulatory liability.  FPL expenses costs
associated with planned fossil maintenance as incurred.  NextEra
Energy Resources uses the deferral method to account for certain planned major
maintenance costs.

FPL's
estimated nuclear maintenance costs for each nuclear unit's next planned outage
are accrued over the period from the end of the last outage to the end of the
next planned outage.  Any difference between the estimated and actual
costs is included in O&M expenses when known.  The accrued
liability for nuclear maintenance costs at December 31, 2009 and 2008
totaled approximately $47 million and $58 million, respectively, and is included
in regulatory liabilities - other.  For the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, FPL recognized approximately $84 million,
$75 million and $77 million, respectively, in nuclear maintenance costs which
are included in O&M expenses in FPL Group's and FPL's consolidated
statements of income.

NextEra
Energy Resources' major maintenance costs for its nuclear generating units and
combustion turbines are capitalized and amortized on a unit of production method
over the period from the end of the last outage to the beginning of the next
planned outage.  NextEra Energy Resources' capitalized major
maintenance costs, net of accumulated amortization, totaled approximately $106
million and $81 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and
are included in other assets.  For the years ended December 31,
2009, 2008 and 2007, NextEra Energy Resources recognized approximately $73
million, $57 million and $43 million in major maintenance costs which are
included in O&M expenses in FPL Group's consolidated statements of
income.

Cash Equivalents

- Cash
equivalents consist of short-term, highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less.


Restricted Cash

- At
December 31, 2009 and 2008, FPL Group had approximately $134 million ($33
million for FPL) and $140 million ($40 million for FPL), respectively, of
restricted cash included in other current assets on FPL Group's and FPL's
consolidated balance sheets, essentially all of which is restricted for margin
cash collateral and debt service payments.  Where offsetting positions
exist, restricted cash related to margin cash collateral is netted against
derivative instruments.  See Note 3.

Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts

- FPL maintains an accumulated provision for uncollectible
customer accounts receivable that is estimated using a percentage, derived from
historical revenue and write-off trends, of the previous five months of
revenue.  Additional amounts are included in the provision to address
specific items that are not considered in the calculation described
above.  NextEra Energy Resources regularly reviews collectibility of
its receivables and establishes a provision for losses estimated as a percentage
of accounts receivable based on the historical bad debt write-off trends for its
retail energy business and, when necessary, using the specific identification
method for all other receivables.

Inventory

- FPL values
materials, supplies and fossil fuel inventory using a weighted-average cost
method.  NextEra Energy Resources' materials, supplies and fossil fuel
inventories are carried at the lower of weighted-average cost or market, unless
evidence indicates that the weighted-average cost (even if in excess of market)
will be recovered with a normal profit upon sale in the ordinary course of
business.

Energy Trading

- FPL Group
provides full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to
distribution utilities, which include load-following services and various
ancillary services, in certain markets and engages in power and gas marketing
and trading activities to optimize the value of electricity and fuel contracts
and generating facilities, as well as to take advantage of expected favorable
commodity price movements.  Trading contracts that meet the definition
of a derivative are accounted for at market value and realized gains and losses
from all trading contracts, including those where physical delivery is required,
are recorded net for all periods presented.  See
Note 3.

Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets

- FPL Group evaluates on an ongoing basis the recoverability of
its assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

- FPL Group's goodwill and other intangible assets are as
follows:

NextEra
Energy Resources has recorded goodwill related to various acquisitions which
were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.  NextEra
Energy Resources' other intangible assets are amortized, primarily on a
straight-line basis, over their estimated useful lives.  For the years
ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, amortization expense was
approximately $14 million, $13 million and $12 million, respectively, and is
expected to be approximately $14 million, $13 million, $12 million, $9 million
and $6 million for 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.

NextEra
Energy Resources' goodwill and other intangible assets are included in other
assets on FPL Group's consolidated balance sheets.  Goodwill is
assessed for impairment at least annually by applying a fair value-based
test.  Other intangible assets are periodically reviewed when
impairment indicators are present to assess recoverability from future
operations using undiscounted future cash flows.


Stock-Based Compensation

-
FPL Group accounts for stock-based payment transactions based on grant-date fair
value.  See Note 11 - Stock-Based Compensation.

Retirement of Long-Term Debt

- - Gains and losses that result from differences in FPL's reacquisition cost and
the book value of long-term debt which is retired are deferred and amortized to
interest expense ratably over the remaining life of the original issue, which is
consistent with its treatment in the ratemaking process.  FPL Group
Capital Inc (FPL Group Capital) recognizes such differences as other income
(deductions) at time of retirement.

Income Taxes

- Deferred
income taxes are provided on all significant temporary differences between the
financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities.  In
connection with the tax sharing agreement between FPL Group and its
subsidiaries, the income tax provision at each subsidiary reflects the use of
the "separate return method," except that tax benefits that could not be used on
a separate return basis, but are used on the consolidated tax return, are
recorded by the subsidiary that generated the tax benefits.  Any
remaining consolidated income tax benefits or expenses are recorded at the
corporate level.  Included in other regulatory assets on FPL Group's
and FPL's consolidated balance sheets is the revenue equivalent of the
difference in accumulated deferred income taxes computed under accounting rules,
as compared to regulatory accounting rules.  This amount totaled $137
million and $92 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and is
being amortized in accordance with the regulatory treatment over the estimated
lives of the assets or liabilities for which the deferred tax amount was
initially recognized.  Investment tax credits (ITCs) for FPL are
deferred and amortized to income over the approximate lives of the related
property in accordance with the regulatory treatment.  At
December 31, 2009 and 2008, deferred ITCs were approximately $8 million and
$16 million, respectively, and are included in other regulatory liabilities on
FPL Group's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets.  NextEra Energy
Resources recognizes ITCs as a reduction to income tax expense when the related
energy property is placed into service.  Production tax credits (PTCs)
are recognized as wind energy is generated and sold based on a per kwh rate
prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes and are recorded as a
reduction of current income taxes payable, unless limited by tax law in which
instance they are recorded as deferred tax assets.  FPL Group and FPL
record a deferred income tax benefit created by the convertible ITCs on the
difference between the financial statement and tax bases of renewable
property.  For NextEra Energy Resources, this deferred income tax
benefit is recorded in income tax expense in the year that the renewable
property is placed in service.  For FPL, this deferred income tax
benefit is offset by a regulatory liability, which is amortized as a reduction
of depreciation expense over the approximate lives of the related renewable
property in accordance with the regulatory treatment.  A valuation
allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets
unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be
realized.  All tax positions taken by FPL Group in its income tax
returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a
more-likely-than-not threshold.  See Note 6.

Guarantees

- FPL Group's and
FPL's payment guarantees and related contracts provided to unconsolidated
entities entered into after December 31, 2002, for which it or a subsidiary
is the guarantor, are recorded at fair value.  See Note 14 -
Commitments.

Variable Interest Entities
(VIEs)

- FPL Group and FPL assess the variable interests they hold to
determine if those entities are VIEs.  See Note 9.  In 2009,
new accounting guidance was issued which modifies the consolidation model in
previous guidance and expands the required disclosures related to
VIEs.  The new accounting guidance became effective on January 1,
2010.  FPL Group and FPL are currently evaluating the impact of the
new accounting guidance.

2.  Employee
Retirement Benefits

Employee Benefit Plans and Other
Postretirement Plan

- FPL Group sponsors a qualified noncontributory
defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of FPL Group and
its subsidiaries.  FPL Group allocates net periodic pension benefit
income to its subsidiaries based on the pensionable earnings of the
subsidiaries' employees.  FPL Group also has a supplemental executive
retirement plan (SERP), which includes a non-qualified supplemental defined
benefit pension component that provides benefits to a select group of management
and highly compensated employees.  FPL Group allocates net periodic
SERP benefit costs to its subsidiaries based upon actuarial calculations by
participant.  The impact of this SERP component is included within
pension benefits in the following tables, and was not material to FPL Group's
financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007.  In addition to pension benefits, FPL Group sponsors a
contributory postretirement plan for health care and life insurance benefits
(other benefits) for retirees of FPL Group and its subsidiaries meeting certain
eligibility requirements.  FPL Group allocates other benefits net
periodic benefit costs to its subsidiaries based upon the number of eligible
employees at each subsidiary.


Implementation of New Accounting
Provisions Regarding Benefit Plans

- Effective December 31, 2006,
FPL Group adopted new recognition and disclosure provisions regarding benefit
plans which require recognition of the funded status of benefit plans in the
balance sheet, with changes in the funded status recognized in comprehensive
income within shareholders' equity in the year in which the changes
occur.  In addition, effective December 31, 2008, the new
provisions required FPL Group to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as
of the fiscal year-end.  Prior to 2008, FPL Group used a measurement
date of September 30.  In lieu of remeasuring plan assets and
obligations as of January 1, 2008, FPL Group elected to calculate the net
periodic benefit (income) cost for the fifteen-month period from
September 30, 2007 to December 31, 2008 using the September 30,
2007 measurement date.  Upon adoption of the measurement date
provisions, FPL Group recorded an adjustment to increase 2008 beginning retained
earnings by approximately $13 million representing three-fifteenths of net
periodic benefit (income) cost for the fifteen-month period from
September 30, 2007 to December 31, 2008.  Included in the
adjustment to retained earnings is approximately $1 million related to the
reduction in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and approximately $3
million related to the reduction in net regulatory
liabilities.  Effective December 31, 2009, FPL Group adopted new
accounting disclosure provisions which require expanded disclosure of plan
assets and fair value measurement techniques.  See Note
4.

Since
FPL Group is the plan sponsor, and its subsidiaries do not have separate rights
to the plan assets or direct obligations to their employees, the results of
implementing the new accounting provisions are reflected at FPL Group and not
allocated to the subsidiaries.  The portion of previously unrecognized
actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs or credits and transition
obligations related to the recognition provision that were estimated to be
allocable to FPL as net periodic benefit (income) cost in future periods and
that otherwise would have been recorded in AOCI were classified as regulatory
assets and liabilities at FPL Group in accordance with regulatory
treatment.  In addition, adjustments to AOCI as a result of
implementing the measurement date provisions that were estimated to be allocable
to FPL were recorded as an adjustment to the previously established regulatory
assets and liabilities.

The
projected 2010 trend assumption used to measure the expected cost of health care
benefits covered by the plans for those under age 65 is 8.00% for medical and
8.50% for prescription drug benefits and for those age 65 and over is 7.50% for
medical and 8.00% for prescription drug benefits.  These rates are
assumed to decrease over the next 9 years for medical benefits and 11 years for
prescription drug benefits to the ultimate trend rate of 5.50% and remain at
that level thereafter.  The ultimate trend rate is assumed to be
reached in 2018 for medical benefits and 2020 for prescription drug
benefits.  Assumed health care cost trend rates have an effect on the
amounts reported for postretirement plans providing health care
benefits.  An increase or decrease of one percentage point in assumed
health care cost trend rates would have a corresponding effect on the other
benefits accumulated obligation of approximately $6 million and $5 million,
respectively, at December 31, 2009.


FPL
Group's current investment policy for the pension plan recognizes the benefit of
protecting the plan's funded status, thereby avoiding the necessity of future
employer contributions.  Its broad objectives are to achieve a high
rate of total return with a prudent level of risk taking while maintaining
sufficient liquidity and diversification to avoid large losses and preserve
capital over the long term.

FPL
Group's pension plan fund has a strategic asset allocation that currently
targets a mix of 45% equity investments, 45% fixed income investments and 10%
convertible bonds.  The fund's investment strategy emphasizes
traditional investments, broadly diversified across the global equity and fixed
income markets, using a combination of different investment styles and
vehicles.  The pension fund's equity investments include direct equity
holdings and assets classified as equity commingled
vehicles.  Similarly, its fixed income investments include direct debt
security holdings and assets classified as debt security commingled
vehicles.  These equity and debt security commingled vehicles include
common and collective trusts, pooled separate accounts, registered investment
companies or other forms of pooled investment arrangements.

With
regard to its other benefits plan, FPL Group's policy is to fund claims as
incurred during the year through FPL Group contributions, participant
contributions and plan assets.  The other benefits plan's assets are
invested with a focus on assuring the availability of funds to pay benefits
while maintaining sufficient diversification to avoid large losses and preserve
capital.  The other benefits plan's fund has a strategic asset
allocation that currently targets a mix of 60% equity investments and 40% fixed
income investments.  The fund's investment strategy emphasizes
traditional investments, diversified across the global equity and fixed income
markets.  The fund's equity investments are comprised of assets
classified as equity commingled vehicles.  Similarly, its fixed income
investments are comprised of assets classified as debt security commingled
vehicles.  These equity and debt commingled vehicles include common
and collective trusts, pooled separate accounts, registered investment companies
or other forms of pooled investment arrangements.

The fair
value measurements of FPL Group's pension plan assets by fair value hierarchy
level are as follows:

¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾

(a)

Includes
      foreign investments of $499 million.

(b)

Includes
      foreign investments of $45 million.

(c)

Includes
      foreign investments of $56 million and $53 million of short-term

The fair
value measurements of FPL Group's other benefits plan assets at
December 31, 2009 were approximately $19 million of equity commingled
vehicles ($4 million of which were foreign investments) and $13 million of debt
security commingled vehicles; all of which were Level 2.

Expected
Cash Flows - FPL Group anticipates paying approximately $29 million for eligible
retiree medical expenses on behalf of the other benefits plan during 2010 with
substantially all amounts being reimbursed through a transfer of assets from the
qualified pension plan.

In
      developing the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for
      its plans, FPL Group evaluated input from its actuaries as well as
      information available in the marketplace.  FPL Group considered
      the 10-year and 20-year historical median returns for a portfolio with an
      equity/bond asset mix similar to its funds.  FPL Group also
      considered its funds' historical compounded returns.  No
      specific adjustments were made to reflect expectations of future
      returns.

Assumed
health care cost trend rates have an effect on the amounts reported for
postretirement plans providing health care benefits.  An increase or
decrease of one percentage point in assumed health care cost trend rates would
have a corresponding effect on the total service and interest cost recognized at
December 31, 2009 by less than $1 million.

Employee Contribution Plans

-
FPL Group offers employee retirement savings plans which allow eligible
participants to contribute a percentage of qualified compensation through
payroll deductions.  FPL Group makes matching contributions to
participants' accounts.  Defined contribution expense pursuant to
these plans was approximately $38 million, $37 million and $35 million for FPL
Group ($28 million, $28 million and $27 million for FPL) for the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  See Note 11
- - Employee Stock Ownership Plan.

3.  Derivative
Instruments

FPL
Group and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and
forwards) to manage the commodity price risk inherent in the purchase and sale
of fuel and electricity, as well as interest rate and foreign currency exchange
rate risk associated with long-term debt.

With
respect to commodities related to FPL Group's competitive energy business,
NextEra Energy Resources employs rigorous risk management procedures in order to
optimize the value of its power generation assets, provide full energy and
capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities, and engage
in power and gas marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected
future favorable price movements and changes in the expected volatility of
prices in the energy markets.  These risk management activities
involve the use of derivative instruments executed within prescribed limits to
manage the risk associated with fluctuating commodity
prices.  Transactions in derivative instruments are executed on
recognized exchanges or via the over the counter markets, depending on the most
favorable credit and market execution factors.  For NextEra Energy
Resources' power generation assets, derivative instruments are used to hedge the
commodity price risk associated with the fuel inputs for requirements of the
assets, where applicable, as well as to hedge the expected energy output of
these assets for the portion of the output that is not covered by long term
power purchase agreements (PPA).  These hedges protect NextEra Energy
Resources against adverse changes in the wholesale forward commodity markets
associated with its generation assets.  With regard to full energy and
capacity requirements services, NextEra Energy Resources is required to vary the
quantity of energy and related services based on the load demands of the
customer served by the distribution utility.  For this type of
transaction, derivative instruments are used to hedge the anticipated
electricity quantities required to serve these customers and protect against
unfavorable changes in the forward energy markets.  Additionally,
NextEra Energy Resources takes positions in the energy markets based on
differences between actual forward market levels and management's view of
fundamental market conditions.  NextEra Energy Resources uses
derivative instruments to realize value from these market dislocations, subject
to strict risk management limits around market, operational and credit
exposure.

Derivative
instruments, when required to be marked to market, are recorded on FPL Group's
and FPL's consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability measured
at fair value.  At FPL, substantially all changes in the derivatives'
fair value are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts
are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the
fuel and purchased power cost recovery clause (fuel clause) or the capacity
clause.  For FPL Group's non-rate regulated operations, predominantly
NextEra Energy Resources, essentially all changes in the derivatives' fair value
for power purchases and sales and trading activities are recognized on a net
basis in operating revenues; fuel purchases and sales are recognized on a net
basis in fuel, purchased power and interchange expense; and the equity method
investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings of equity method
investees in FPL Group's consolidated statements of income unless hedge
accounting is applied.  Settlement gains and losses are included
within the line items in the consolidated statements of income to which they
relate.


While
most of NextEra Energy Resources' derivative transactions are entered into for
the purpose of managing commodity price risk, and to reduce the impact of
volatility in interest rates stemming from changes in variable interest rates on
outstanding debt, hedge accounting is only applied where specific criteria are
met and it is practicable to do so.  In order to apply hedge
accounting, the transaction must be designated as a hedge and it must be highly
effective in offsetting the hedged risk.  Additionally, for hedges of
commodity price risk, physical delivery for forecasted commodity transactions
must be probable.  FPL Group believes that, where offsetting positions
exist at the same location for the same time, the transactions are considered to
have been netted and therefore physical delivery has been deemed not to have
occurred for financial reporting purposes.  Transactions for which
physical delivery is deemed not to have occurred are presented on a net
basis.  Generally, the hedging instrument's effectiveness is assessed
using regression analysis for commodity contracts, and nonstatistical methods
including dollar value comparisons of the change in the fair value of the
derivative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item, for
interest rate swaps.  Hedge effectiveness is tested at the inception
of the hedge and on at least a quarterly basis throughout its
life.  At December 31, 2009, FPL Group had cash flow hedges with
expiration dates through December 2012 for energy contract derivative
instruments, interest rate cash flow hedges with expiration dates through
May 2024 and a foreign currency cash flow hedge that expires in December
2011.  The effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative
instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is reported as a component of OCI and
is reclassified into earnings in the period(s) during which the transaction
being hedged affects earnings.  See Note 7.  The
ineffective portion of net unrealized gains (losses) on these hedges is reported
in earnings in the current period, and amounted to approximately $29 million,
$25 million and $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively.  In January 2010, FPL Group discontinued hedge
accounting for its cash flow hedges related to energy contract derivative
instruments.

FPL
Group's and FPL's mark-to-market derivative instrument assets (liabilities) are
included in the consolidated balance sheets as follows:

¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾

At
December 31, 2009 and 2008, FPL Group had approximately $18 million and $66
million (none at FPL), respectively, in margin cash collateral received from
counterparties that was not offset against derivative assets.  These
amounts are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance
sheets.  Additionally, at December 31, 2009 and 2008, FPL Group
had approximately $95 million and $98 million (none at FPL), respectively, in
margin cash collateral provided to counterparties that was not offset against
derivative liabilities.  These amounts are included in other current
assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

As
discussed above, FPL Group uses derivative instruments to, among other things,
manage its commodity price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency
exchange rate risk.  The table above presents FPL Group's and FPL's
net derivative positions at December 31, 2009, which reflect the offsetting
of positions of certain transactions within the portfolio, the contractual
ability to settle contracts under master netting arrangements and the netting of
margin cash collateral.  However, disclosure rules require that the
following tables be presented on a gross basis.


The fair
values of FPL Group's derivatives designated as hedging instruments for
accounting purposes are presented below as gross asset and liability values, as
required by disclosure rules.  However, the majority of the underlying
contracts are subject to master netting arrangements and would not be
contractually settled on a gross basis.

¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾

For the
year ended December 31, 2009, FPL Group recorded a loss of $6 million on a
fair value hedge which is reflected in interest expense in the consolidated
statements of income and resulted in a corresponding reduction of the related
debt.

The fair
values of FPL Group's and FPL's derivatives not designated as hedging
instruments for accounting purposes are presented below as gross asset and
liability values, as required by disclosure rules.  However, the
majority of the underlying contracts are subject to master netting arrangements
and would not be contractually settled on a gross basis.

In
      addition, for the year ended December 31, 2009, FPL recorded
      approximately $688 million of losses related to commodity contracts as
      regulatory assets on its consolidated balance
  sheets.

The
following table represents net notional volumes associated with derivative
instruments that are required to be reported at fair value in FPL Group's and
FPL's consolidated financial statements.  The table includes
significant volumes of transactions that have minimal exposure to commodity
price changes because they are variable priced agreements.  The table
does not present a complete picture of FPL Group's and FPL's overall net
economic exposure because FPL Group and FPL do not use derivative instruments to
hedge all of their commodity exposures.  At December 31, 2009,
FPL Group and FPL had derivative commodity contracts for the following net

At
December 31, 2009, FPL Group had fifteen interest rate swaps with a notional
amount totaling approximately $2.3 billion and two foreign currency swaps with a
notional amount totaling approximately $290 million.

Certain
of FPL Group's and FPL's derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related
contingent features including, among other things, the requirement to maintain
an investment grade credit rating from specified credit rating agencies and
certain financial ratios, as well as credit-related cross default and material
adverse change triggers.  At December 31, 2009, the aggregate
fair value of FPL Group's derivative instruments with credit-risk-related
contingent features that were in a liability position was approximately $1.0
billion ($0.1 billion for FPL).

If the
credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements and other
wholesale commodity contracts were triggered, FPL Group or FPL could be required
to post collateral or settle contracts according to contractual terms which
generally allow netting of contracts in offsetting positions.  Certain
contracts contain multiple types of credit-related triggers.  To the
extent these contracts contain a credit ratings downgrade trigger, the maximum
exposure is included in the following credit ratings collateral posting
requirements.  If FPL Group Capital's or FPL's credit ratings were
downgraded to BBB+/Baa1 (a two level downgrade for FPL and a one level downgrade
for FPL Group Capital from the current lowest rating), FPL Group would be
required to post collateral such that the total posted collateral would be
approximately $50 million (none at FPL).

If FPL Group
Capital's and FPL's credit ratings were downgraded to below investment grade,
FPL Group would be required to post additional collateral such that the total
posted collateral would be approximately $1.4 billion ($0.6 billion at
FPL).  Some contracts at FPL Group, including some FPL contracts, do
not contain credit ratings downgrade triggers, but do contain provisions that
require certain financial measures be maintained and/or have credit-related
cross-default triggers.  In the event these provisions were triggered,
FPL Group could be required to post additional collateral of up to approximately
$500 million ($100 million at FPL).

Collateral
may be posted in the form of cash or credit support.  At
December 31, 2009, FPL Group had posted approximately $75 million (none at
FPL) in the form of letters of credit in the normal course of business which
could be applied toward the collateral requirements described
above.  FPL and FPL Group Capital have bank revolving lines of credit
in excess of the collateral requirements described above that would be available
to support, among other things, derivative activities.  Under the
terms of the bank revolving lines of credit, maintenance of a specific credit
rating is not a condition to drawing on these credit facilities, although there
are other conditions to drawing on these credit facilities.


Additionally,
some contracts contain certain adequate assurance provisions where a
counterparty may demand additional collateral based on subjective events and/or
conditions.  Due to the subjective nature of these provisions, FPL
Group and FPL are unable to determine an exact value for these items and they
are not included in any of the quantitative disclosures above.

4.  Fair
Value Measurements

FPL
Group and FPL use several different valuation techniques to measure the fair
value of assets and liabilities, relying primarily on the market approach of
using prices and other market information for identical and/or comparable assets
and liabilities for those assets and liabilities that are measured on a
recurring basis.  Certain derivatives and financial instruments are
valued using option pricing models and take into consideration multiple inputs
including commodity prices, volatility factors and discount rates, as well as
counterparty credit ratings and credit enhancements.  Additionally,
when observable market data is not sufficient, valuation models are developed
that incorporate FPL Group's and FPL's proprietary views of market factors and
conditions.  FPL Group's and FPL's assessment of the significance of
any particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may
affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement
within the fair value hierarchy levels.

FPL
Group's and FPL's financial assets and liabilities and other fair value
measurements made on a recurring basis by fair value hierarchy level are as
follows:

5.  Financial
Instruments

FPL
Group and FPL adopted new accounting and disclosure provisions related to other
than temporary impairments and the fair value of financial instruments beginning
April 1, 2009.  Under the new accounting provisions, an
investment in a debt security is required to be assessed for an other than
temporary impairment based on whether the entity has an intent to sell or more
likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of
its amortized cost basis.  Additionally, if the entity does not expect
to recover the amortized cost of a debt security, an impairment is recognized in
earnings equal to the estimated credit loss.  For debt securities held
as of April 1, 2009 for which an other than temporary impairment had been
previously recognized but for which assessment under the new accounting
provisions indicates the impairment is temporary, FPL Group recorded an
adjustment to increase April 1, 2009 retained earnings by approximately $5
million with a corresponding reduction in AOCI.

The
carrying amounts of cash equivalents, notes payable and commercial paper
approximate their fair values.  At both December 31, 2009 and
2008, other investments of FPL Group, not included in the table below, included
financial instruments of approximately $39 million, which primarily consist of
notes receivable that are carried at estimated fair value or cost, which
approximates fair value.  See Note 10.


The
following estimates of the fair value of financial instruments have been made
primarily using available market information.  However, the use of
different market assumptions or methods of valuation could result in different
estimated fair values.

Special Use Funds

- The
special use funds consist of FPL's storm fund assets of $123 million and FPL
Group's and FPL's nuclear decommissioning fund assets of $3,267 million and
$2,285 million, respectively, at December 31, 2009.  Securities
held in the special use funds consist of equity and debt securities which are
classified as available for sale and are carried at estimated fair value based
on quoted market prices.  For FPL's special use funds, consistent with
regulatory treatment, market adjustments, including any other than temporary
impairment losses, result in a corresponding adjustment to the related
regulatory liability accounts.  For FPL Group's non-rate regulated
operations, market adjustments result in a corresponding adjustment to OCI,
except for unrealized losses associated with marketable securities considered to
be other than temporary, including any credit losses, which are recognized as a
loss in FPL Group's consolidated statements of income.  Debt
securities included in the nuclear decommissioning funds have a weighted-average
maturity at December 31, 2009 of approximately seven years at both FPL
Group and FPL.  FPL's storm fund primarily consists of municipal debt
securities with a weighted-average maturity at December 31, 2009 of
approximately three years.  The cost of securities sold is determined
using the specific identification method.

The
approximate realized gains and losses and proceeds from the sale of available
for sale securities are as follows:


The
unrealized gains on available for sale securities are as follows:

The
total unrealized losses on available for sale debt securities and the fair value
of available for sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position are as
follows:

¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾

(a)

FPL
      Group had 47 securities in an unrealized loss position for greater than
      twelve months, including 18 securities for FPL.  The total
      unrealized loss on these securities was approximately $3 million and the
      fair value was approximately $37 million for FPL Group, including
      approximately $2 million of unrealized losses with a fair value of
      approximately $25 million for FPL.  Consistent with regulatory
      treatment for FPL, marketable securities held in special use funds are
      classified as available for sale and are carried at market value with
      market adjustments, including any other than temporary impairment losses,
      resulting in a corresponding adjustment to the related regulatory
      liability accounts.

Regulations
issued by the FERC and the NRC provide general risk management guidelines to
protect nuclear decommissioning funds and to allow such funds to earn a
reasonable return.  The FERC regulations prohibit investments in any
securities of FPL Group or its subsidiaries, affiliates or associates, excluding
investments tied to market indices or mutual funds.  Similar
restrictions applicable to the decommissioning funds for NextEra Energy
Resources' nuclear plants are contained in the NRC operating licenses for those
facilities or in NRC regulations applicable to NRC licensees not in
cost-of-service environments.  With respect to the decommissioning
fund for NextEra Energy Resources' Seabrook nuclear plant, decommissioning fund
contributions and withdrawals are also regulated by the NDFC pursuant to New
Hampshire law.

The
nuclear decommissioning reserve funds are managed by investment managers who
must comply with the guidelines of FPL Group and FPL and rules of the applicable
regulatory authorities.  The funds' assets are invested giving
consideration to taxes, liquidity, risk, diversification and other prudent
investment objectives.

Interest Rate and Foreign Currency
Swaps

- FPL Group and its subsidiaries use a combination of fixed rate
and variable rate debt to manage interest rate exposure.  Interest
rate swaps are used to mitigate and adjust interest rate exposure when deemed
appropriate based upon market conditions or when required by financing
agreements.  In addition, FPL Group Capital entered into a cross
currency basis swap to hedge against currency movements with respect to both
interest and principal payments on a loan and a cross currency swap to hedge
against currency and interest rate movements with respect to both interest and
principal payments on a loan.

(b)

Amount
      is presented net of $58 million of tax carryforwards that are available to
      offset FPL Group's liability for unrecognized tax
  benefits.


The
majority of the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits represent tax
positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which
there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility.  A
disallowance of the shorter deductibility period for these tax positions would
not affect the annual effective income tax rate.  Included in the
liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009 is
approximately $5 million at FPL Group ($1 million at FPL) that, if disallowed,
could impact the annual effective income tax rate.

FPL
Group recognizes interest income (expense) related to unrecognized tax benefits
(liabilities) in interest income and interest expense, respectively, net of the
amount deferred at FPL.  At FPL, the offset to accrued interest
receivable (payable) on income taxes is classified as a regulatory liability
(regulatory asset) which will be amortized to income (expense) over a five-year
period upon settlement in accordance with regulatory treatment.  At
December 31, 2009 and 2008, FPL Group accrued approximately $135 million
and $111 million for net interest receivable ($38 million and $23 million for
FPL), respectively.  For the years ended December 31, 2009 and
2008, FPL Group recorded $9 million and $10 million of interest, $13 million and
$14 million of which was recognized as interest income in FPL Group's
consolidated statements of income and $(4) million and $(4) million,
respectively, in regulatory liabilities on FPL Group's and FPL's consolidated
balance sheets.

A
reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

FPL
Group and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal
jurisdiction and various states, the most significant of which is
Florida.  FPL Group and FPL are effectively no longer subject to U.S.
federal, state and local examinations by taxing authorities for years before
2003.  FPL Group is planning to appeal an adverse court decision
related to FPL Group's and FPL's method for deducting certain repairs related to
years prior to 2000 and the denial of a refund claim related to
ITCs.  FPL Group is planning to file refund claims with respect to its
U.S. income tax returns for 2000 through 2002, primarily related to deductions
for repairs and depreciation deductions attributable to an acquired power
plant.  FPL Group is also disputing certain adjustments proposed by
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to its U.S. income tax returns for 2003
through 2005.  These IRS proposed adjustments primarily relate to FPL
Group's and FPL's method for certain deductions for repairs, casualty losses and
capitalizing indirect service costs.  Additionally, income tax returns
for 2006, 2007 and 2008 are under examination.  As such, the amount of
unrecognized tax benefits and related interest accruals may change within the
next twelve months; however, FPL Group and FPL do not expect these changes to
have a significant impact on FPL Group's or FPL's financial
statements.


7.  Comprehensive
Income

The
components of FPL Group's comprehensive income and accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) are as follows:

¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾

(a)

Includes
      amounts reclassified into earnings due to discontinuance of cash flow
      hedges of approximately $3 million (net of $2 million tax benefit) for
      which the hedged transactions are no longer probable of
      occurring.

(b)

Approximately
      $39 million of gains is expected to be reclassified into earnings within
      the next 12 months as either the hedged fuel is consumed, electricity is
      sold or interest payments are made.  Such amount assumes no
      change in fuel prices, power prices or interest rates.

(c)

Less
      than $1 million of prior service benefits and less than $1 million of
      transition obligations is expected to be reclassified into earnings within
      the next 12 months.


8.

Jointly-Owned Electric
Plants

Certain
FPL Group subsidiaries own undivided interests in the jointly-owned facilities
described below, and are entitled to a proportionate share of the output from
those facilities.  FPL and NextEra Energy Resources are responsible
for their share of the operating costs, as well as providing their own
financing.  Accordingly, each subsidiary includes its proportionate
share of the facilities and related revenues and expenses in the appropriate
balance sheet and statement of income captions.  FPL Group's and FPL's
respective shares of direct expenses for these facilities are included in fuel,
purchased power and interchange, O&M expenses, depreciation and amortization
expense and taxes other than income taxes and other on FPL Group's and FPL's
consolidated statements of income.

FPL
Group's and FPL's proportionate ownership interest in jointly-owned facilities
is as follows:

9.

Variable Interest
Entities

Accounting
guidance requires the consolidation of entities which are determined to be VIEs
when the reporting company determines that it will absorb a majority of the
VIE's expected losses, receive a majority of the VIE's residual returns, or
both.  The company that is required to consolidate the VIE is called
the primary beneficiary.  Conversely, the reporting company would not
consolidate VIEs in which it has a majority ownership interest when the company
is not considered to be the primary beneficiary.  Variable interests
are contractual, ownership or other monetary interests in an entity that change
as the fair value of the entity's net assets, excluding variable interests,
change.  An entity is considered to be a VIE when its capital is
insufficient to permit it to finance its activities without additional
subordinated financial support or its equity investors, as a group, lack the
characteristics of having a controlling financial interest.  As of
December 31, 2009, FPL Group has two VIEs which it
consolidates.

FPL

- FPL is considered the
primary beneficiary of, and therefore consolidates, a VIE from which it leases
nuclear fuel for its nuclear units.  FPL is considered the primary
beneficiary of this VIE because in the case of default by the VIE on its debt,
FPL would be required to purchase the VIE's nuclear fuel and because FPL
guarantees the VIE's debt.  For ratemaking purposes, these leases are
treated as operating leases.  For financial reporting, the cost of
nuclear fuel is capitalized and amortized to fuel expense on a unit of
production method except for the interest component, which is recorded as
interest expense.  These charges, as well as a charge for spent
nuclear fuel, are recovered through the fuel clause.  FPL makes
quarterly payments to the lessor for the lease commitments.  The
lessor has issued commercial paper to fund the procurement of nuclear fuel and
FPL has provided a $600 million guarantee to support the commercial paper
program.  Under certain lease termination circumstances, the
associated debt, which consists primarily of commercial paper (approximately
$425 million and $347 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively)
would become due.  The consolidated assets of the VIE consist
primarily of nuclear fuel, which had a net carrying value of approximately $389
million and $338 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.

FPL is
considered the primary beneficiary of, and therefore consolidates, a VIE that is
a wholly-owned bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that it formed in
2007 for the sole purpose of issuing storm-recovery bonds pursuant to the
securitization provisions of the Florida Statutes and an FPSC financing
order.  Four hurricanes in 2005 and three hurricanes in 2004 caused
major damage in parts of FPL's service territory.  Storm restoration
costs incurred by FPL during 2005 and 2004 exceeded the amount in FPL's funded
storm and property insurance reserve, resulting in a storm reserve
deficiency.  In 2007, the VIE issued $652 million aggregate principal
amount of senior secured bonds (storm-recovery bonds), primarily for the
after-tax equivalent of the total of FPL's unrecovered balance of the 2004 storm
restoration costs, the 2005 storm restoration costs and approximately $200
million to reestablish FPL's storm and property insurance
reserve.  See Note 12.


In
connection with this financing, net proceeds, after debt issuance costs, to the
VIE (approximately $644 million) were used to acquire the storm-recovery
property, which includes the right to impose, collect and receive a
storm-recovery charge from all customers receiving electric transmission or
distribution service from FPL under rate schedules approved by the FPSC or under
special contracts, certain other rights and interests that arise under the
financing order issued by the FPSC and certain other collateral pledged by the
VIE that issued the bonds.  The storm-recovery bonds are payable only
from and secured by the storm-recovery property.  FPL, as the
servicer, collects storm-recovery charges on behalf of the VIE through a
surcharge to retail customers and remits them to the trustee under the indenture
pursuant to which the storm-recovery bonds were issued for payment of fees and
expenses and payment of principal and interest on the storm-recovery
bonds.  The revenues from the storm-recovery bonds surcharge and a
2004 storm damage surcharge through which FPL had been recovering underrecovered
2004 storm restoration costs prior to the issuance of these storm-recovery bonds
are included in operating revenues on FPL Group's and FPL's consolidated
statements of income.  For the years ended December 31, 2009,
2008 and 2007, both the amount billed to retail customers related to the 2004
storm damage surcharge and/or the storm-recovery bonds surcharge amounted to
approximately $91 million, $97 million and $94 million,
respectively.  The VIE is consolidated for financial reporting
purposes; however, the storm-recovery bonds do not constitute a debt, liability
or other legal obligation of, or interest in, FPL or any of its affiliates other
than the VIE that issued the storm-recovery bonds.  The assets of the
VIE that issued the storm-recovery bonds, including the storm-recovery property,
are not available to pay creditors of FPL or any of its affiliates other than
the VIE that issued the storm-recovery bonds.  The consolidated assets
of the VIE were approximately $588 million and $628 million at December 31,
2009 and 2008, respectively, and consisted primarily of storm-recovery property,
which is included in securitized storm-recovery costs on FPL Group's and FPL's
consolidated balance sheets.

In
connection with this financing, the net proceeds to FPL from the sale of the
storm-recovery property were used primarily to reimburse FPL for its estimated
net of tax storm reserve deficiency as of May 31, 2007 (approximately $517
million) and provide for a storm and property insurance reserve fund of
approximately $127 million net of tax.  Securities held in the storm
and property insurance reserve fund are carried at market value with market
adjustments resulting in a corresponding adjustment to the storm and property
insurance reserve.  Fund earnings, net of taxes, are reinvested in the
fund.  The tax effects of amounts not yet recognized for tax purposes
are included in accumulated deferred income taxes.  The storm and
property insurance reserve fund is included in special use funds on FPL Group's
and FPL's consolidated balance sheets and was approximately $123 million at both
December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  Upon the issuance of
the storm-recovery bonds, the storm reserve deficiency was reclassified to
securitized storm-recovery costs on FPL Group's and FPL's consolidated balance
sheets.  As storm-recovery charges are billed to customers, the
securitized storm-recovery costs are amortized, the amount of which is included
in storm cost amortization on FPL Group's and FPL's consolidated statements of
income.

The
storm and property insurance reserve of approximately $200 million that was
reestablished in the FPSC financing order is not reflected in FPL Group's and
FPL's consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2009 or 2008 because
the associated regulatory asset does not meet the specific recognition criteria
under regulatory accounting guidance.  As a result, the storm and
property insurance reserve will be recognized as a regulatory liability as the
storm-recovery charges are billed to customers and charged to storm cost
amortization on FPL Group's and FPL's consolidated statements of
income.  Although FPL Group's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets as
of December 31, 2009 reflect a storm and property insurance reserve of
approximately $23 million (included in regulatory liabilities - other on FPL
Group's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets), FPL has the capacity to absorb
up to approximately $198 million in future prudently incurred storm restoration
costs without seeking recovery through a rate adjustment from the
FPSC.

FPL
identified one potential VIE, which is considered a qualifying facility as
defined by the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended
(PURPA).  PURPA requires FPL to purchase the electricity output of the
project.  FPL entered into a PPA in 1990 with this 250 megawatt (mw)
coal-fired qualifying facility to purchase substantially all of the project's
electrical output over a substantial portion of its estimated useful
life.  FPL absorbs a portion of the project’s variability related to
changes in the market price of coal through the price it pays per mwh (energy
payment).  After making exhaustive efforts, FPL was unable to obtain
the information from the project necessary to determine whether the project is a
VIE or whether FPL is the primary beneficiary of the project.  The PPA
with the project contains no provision which legally obligates the project to
release this information to FPL.  The energy payments paid by FPL will
fluctuate as coal prices change.  This fluctuation does not expose FPL
to losses since the energy payments paid by FPL to the project are passed on to
FPL's customers through the fuel clause as approved by the
FPSC.  Notwithstanding the fact that FPL's energy payments are
recovered through the fuel clause, if the project was determined to be a VIE,
the absorption of some of the project's fuel price variability might cause FPL
to be considered the primary beneficiary.  During the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, FPL purchased 1,604,735 mwh, 1,725,798
mwh and 1,694,810 mwh, respectively, from the project at a total cost of
approximately $173 million, $158 million and $153 million,
respectively.  FPL will continue to make exhaustive efforts to obtain
the necessary information from the potential VIE in order to determine if it is
a VIE and, if so, whether FPL is the primary beneficiary.


Additionally,
FPL entered into a PPA in 1995 with a 330 mw coal-fired qualifying facility to
purchase substantially all of the project's electrical output over a substantial
portion of its estimated useful life.  FPL absorbs a portion of the
project’s variability related to changes in the market price of coal through the
energy payment.  After making exhaustive efforts, FPL determined that
the project is a VIE, however, FPL was unable to obtain the information
necessary to determine if FPL is the project’s primary
beneficiary.  The PPA with the project contains no provisions which
legally obligate the project to release this information to FPL.  The
energy payments paid by FPL will fluctuate as coal prices
changes.  This fluctuation does not expose FPL to losses since the
energy payments paid by FPL to the project are passed on to FPL’s customers
through the fuel clause as approved by the FPSC.  During the years
ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, FPL purchased 1,485,662 mwh,
2,317,345 mwh and 2,320,991 mwh, respectively, from the project at a total cost
of approximately $205 million, $227 million and $220 million,
respectively.  FPL will continue to make exhaustive efforts to obtain
the necessary information from the project in order to determine if FPL is the
primary beneficiary.

FPL Group

- In 2004, a trust
created by FPL Group sold $300 million of 5 7/8% preferred trust securities to
the public and $9 million of common trust securities to FPL
Group.  The trust is considered a VIE because FPL Group's investment
through the common trust securities is not considered equity at
risk.  The proceeds from the sale of the preferred and common trust
securities were used to buy 5 7/8% junior subordinated debentures maturing in
March 2044 from FPL Group Capital.  The trust exists only to issue its
preferred trust securities and common trust securities and to hold the junior
subordinated debentures of FPL Group Capital as trust assets.  FPL
Group has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the preferred trust securities
and the junior subordinated debentures.  Since FPL Group, as the
common security holder, is not considered to have equity at risk and will
therefore not absorb any variability of the trust, FPL Group is not the primary
beneficiary and does not consolidate the trust.  FPL Group includes
the junior subordinated debentures issued by FPL Group Capital on its
consolidated balance sheets.  The junior subordinated debentures are
FPL Group's maximum exposure to loss.  See Note 12.

10.  Investments
in Partnerships and Joint Ventures

NextEra Energy Resources

- NextEra Energy Resources
has non-controlling non-majority owned interests in various partnerships and
joint ventures, essentially all of which are electricity
producers.  At December 31, 2009 and 2008, NextEra Energy
Resources' investment in partnerships and joint ventures totaled approximately
$173 million and $189 million, respectively, which is included in other
investments on FPL Group's consolidated balance sheets.  NextEra
Energy Resources' interest in these partnerships and joint ventures range from
approximately 5.5% to 50%.  At December 31, 2009, the principal
operating entities included in NextEra Energy Resources' investments in
partnerships and joint ventures were Northeast Energy, LP, Luz Solar Partners
Ltd., V, Mojave 16/17/18 LLC, Luz Solar Partners Ltd., III, and Luz Solar
Partners Ltd., IV and in 2008 also included TPC Windfarms LLC.

Certain
subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources provide services to the partnerships
and joint ventures, including operations and maintenance and business management
services.  FPL Group's operating revenues for the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 include approximately $21 million, $21
million and $20 million, respectively, related to such services.  The
net receivables at December 31, 2009 and 2008, for these services, as well
as for affiliate energy commodity transactions, payroll and other payments made
on behalf of these investees, were approximately $29 million and $33 million,
respectively, and are included in other current assets on FPL Group's
consolidated balance sheets.


Notes
receivable (long- and short-term) include approximately $16 million and $24
million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, due from partnerships
and joint ventures in which NextEra Energy Resources has an ownership
interest.  Approximately $6 million of the notes receivable balance at
December 31, 2009 mature in 2011 and bear interest at a fixed rate of
8.5%.  The remaining $10 million mature in 2014 and bear interest at a
variable rate which averaged approximately 10.4% in
2009.  Approximately $11 million of the notes receivable balance at
December 31, 2008 mature in 2011 and bear interest at a fixed rate of
8.5%.  The remaining $13 million mature in 2014 and bear interest at a
variable rate which averaged approximately 13.4% in 2008.  Interest
income related to notes receivable totaled approximately $2 million, $4 million
and $4 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, and is included in interest income in FPL Group's consolidated
statements of income.  Interest receivable associated with these notes
as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 was not material.

Sale of Differential Membership
Interests

- In December 2007, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
NextEra Energy Resources sold its Class B membership interests in a subsidiary
that owns five wind facilities totaling 598 mw of wind generation for
approximately $705 million.  In exchange for the cash received, the
holders of the Class B membership interests will receive a portion of the
economic attributes of the facilities, including tax attributes, for a variable
period.  Recognition of the proceeds from the sale of the differential
membership interests was deferred and is recorded in other liabilities on FPL
Group's consolidated balance sheets.  The deferred amount totaled $700
million and $706 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and
is being recognized as an adjustment to taxes other than income taxes and other
in FPL Group's consolidated statements of income as the members receive their
portion of the economic attributes.  FPL Group continues to operate
and manage the wind facilities, and consolidates the entity that owns the wind
facilities.

11.

Common and Preferred
Stock

Earnings Per Share

- The
reconciliation of FPL Group's basic and diluted earnings per share of common
stock is as follows:

¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾

(a)

Performance
      share awards are included in diluted weighted-average number of common
      shares outstanding based upon what would be issued if the end of the
      reporting period was the end of the term of the
      award.  Restricted stock, performance share awards, options,
      warrants and equity units are included in diluted weighted-average number
      of common shares outstanding by applying the treasury stock
      method.

Restricted
stock, performance share awards and common shares issuable upon the exercise of
stock options which were not included in the denominator above due to their
antidilutive effect were approximately 0.8 million, 0.5 million and 0.2 million
for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

On
January 1, 2009, FPL Group adopted accounting guidance which required companies
to treat unvested stock-based payment awards that have non-forfeitable rights to
dividends or dividend equivalents as participating
securities.  Therefore, these participating securities had to be
included in the computation of earnings per share, pursuant to the two-class
method described in the accounting guidance.  The effect of the
retrospective application of the new accounting guidance was a reduction of less
than $0.01 per share on FPL Group's earnings per share, assuming dilution, for
the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.

Common Stock Dividend
Restrictions

- FPL Group's charter does not limit the dividends that may
be paid on its common stock.  FPL's mortgage securing FPL's first
mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the
payment of dividends and other distributions to FPL Group.  These
restrictions do not currently limit FPL's ability to pay dividends to FPL
Group.


Employee Stock Ownership Plan

- - The employee retirement savings plans of FPL Group include a leveraged ESOP
feature.  Shares of common stock held by the trust for the employee
retirement savings plans (Trust) are used to provide all or a portion of the
employers' matching contributions.  Dividends received on all shares,
along with cash contributions from the employers, are used to pay principal and
interest on an ESOP loan held by a subsidiary of FPL Group
Capital.  Dividends on shares allocated to employee accounts and used
by the Trust for debt service are replaced with shares of common stock, at
prevailing market prices, in an equivalent amount.  For purposes of
computing basic and fully diluted earnings per share, ESOP shares that have been
committed to be released are considered outstanding.

ESOP-related
compensation expense of approximately $42 million, $40 million and $35 million
in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, was recognized based on the fair value of
shares allocated to employee accounts during the period.  Interest
income on the ESOP loan is eliminated in consolidation.  ESOP-related
unearned compensation included as a reduction of common shareholders' equity at
December 31, 2009 was approximately $85 million, representing unallocated
shares at the original issue price.  The fair value of the
ESOP-related unearned compensation account using the closing price of FPL Group
common stock at December 31, 2009 was approximately $308
million.

Stock-Based Compensation

-
FPL Group accounts for stock-based payment transactions based on grant-date fair
value.  Net income for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008
and 2007 includes approximately $51 million, $47 million and $39 million,
respectively, of compensation costs and $20 million, $18 million and $15
million, respectively, of income tax benefits related to stock-based
compensation arrangements.  Compensation cost capitalized as part of
the cost of an asset for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was
approximately $3 million and $2 million, respectively.  No
compensation cost was capitalized in the year ended December 31,
2007.  As of December 31, 2009, there were approximately $67
million of unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested/nonexercisable
stock-based compensation arrangements.  These costs are expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years.  For awards
granted subsequent to December 31, 2005, compensation costs for awards with
graded vesting are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite
service period for the entire award.  For awards granted prior to that
date, compensation costs for awards with graded vesting are recognized using the
graded vesting attribution method.

At
December 31, 2009, approximately 26 million shares of common stock were
authorized and approximately 13 million were available for awards (including
outstanding awards) to officers, employees and non-employee directors of FPL
Group and its subsidiaries under FPL Group's amended and restated long-term
incentive plan and non-employee directors stock plans.  FPL Group
satisfies restricted stock and performance share awards by issuing new shares of
its common stock or by purchasing shares of its common stock in the open
market.  FPL Group satisfies stock option exercises by issuing new
shares of its common stock and generally grants most of its stock options in the
first quarter of each year.

Restricted
Stock and Performance Share Awards

- Restricted stock
typically vests within three years after the date of grant and is subject to,
among other things, restrictions on transferability prior to
vesting.  The fair value of restricted stock is measured based upon
the closing market price of FPL Group common stock as of the date of
grant.  Performance share awards are typically payable at the end of a
three-year performance period if the specified performance criteria are
met.  The fair value of performance share awards is estimated based
upon the closing market price of FPL Group common stock as of the date of grant
less the present value of expected dividends, multiplied by an estimated
performance multiple determined on the basis of historical experience, which is
subsequently trued up based on actual performance.

The
activity in restricted stock and performance share awards for the year ended
December 31, 2009 was as follows:

respectively.  The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of
performance share awards granted for the years ended December 31, 2008 and

The
total fair value of restricted stock and performance share awards vested was $46
million, $64 million and $51 million for the years ended December 31, 2009,

Options
- - Options typically vest within three years after the date of grant and have a
maximum term of ten years.  The exercise price of each option granted
equals the closing market price of FPL Group common stock on the date of
grant.  The fair value of the options is estimated on the date of the
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and based on the following

Continuous Offering of FPL Group
Common Stock

-

In January 2009,
FPL Group entered into an agreement under which FPL Group may offer and sell,
from time to time, FPL Group common stock having a gross sales price of up to
$400 million.  During 2009, FPL Group received gross proceeds through
the sale and issuance of common stock under this agreement of approximately $160
million consisting of 2,890,000 shares at an average price of
$55.53.

Preferred Stock

- FPL Group's
charter authorizes the issuance of 100 million shares of serial preferred stock,
$0.01 par value, none of which are outstanding.  FPL's charter
authorizes the issuance of 10,414,100 shares of preferred stock, $100 par value;
5 million shares of subordinated preferred stock, no par value and 5 million
shares of preferred stock, no par value, none of which are
outstanding.

$676 million for 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.  The
respective amounts for FPL are approximately $42 million, $46 million, $50
million, $453 million and $56 million.

At
December 31, 2009, commercial paper borrowings had a weighted-average
interest rate of 0.19% (0.19% for FPL), and at December 31, 2008,
commercial paper and short-term borrowings had a weighted-average interest rate
of 2.10% (0.92% for FPL).  Available lines of credit aggregated
approximately $6.4 billion ($3.9 billion for FPL Group Capital and $2.5 billion
for FPL) at December 31, 2009 and were available to support FPL's and FPL
Group Capital's commercial paper programs.  These facilities provide
for the issuance of letters of credit of up to approximately $6.4
billion.  The issuance of letters of credit is subject to the
aggregate commitment under the applicable facility.  While no direct
borrowings were outstanding at December 31, 2009, letters of credit
totaling $492 million and $3 million were outstanding under the FPL Group
Capital and FPL credit facilities, respectively.


FPL
Group has guaranteed certain payment obligations of FPL Group Capital, including
most of those under FPL Group Capital's debt, including all of its debentures
and commercial paper issuances, as well as most of its
guarantees.  FPL Group Capital has guaranteed certain debt and other
obligations of NextEra Energy Resources and its subsidiaries.

In 2008,
FPL entered into a reclaimed water agreement with Palm Beach County, Florida
(PBC) to provide FPL's WCEC with reclaimed water for cooling purposes beginning
in January 2011.  Under the reclaimed water agreement, FPL is to
construct a reclaimed water system, including modifications to an existing
treatment plant and a water pipeline, that PBC will legally own and
operate.  The reclaimed water agreement also requires PBC to issue
bonds for the purpose of paying the costs associated with the construction of
the reclaimed water system.  In 2009, PBC issued approximately $68
million principal amount of Palm Beach County, Florida Water and Sewer Revenue
Bonds.  Under the reclaimed water agreement, FPL will pay PBC an
operating fee for the reclaimed water delivered which will be used by PBC to,
among other things, service the principal of, and interest on, the
bonds.  The portion of the operating fee related to PBC's servicing
principal of, and interest on, the bonds will be paid by FPL, beginning October
2011, until final maturity of the bonds.  FPL does not have a direct
obligation to the bondholders; however, if FPL or PBC were to terminate the
reclaimed water agreement, FPL would be obligated to continue to pay the portion
of the operating fee intended to reimburse PBC for costs related to issuance of
the bonds, including amounts to be used by PBC to service the principal of, and
interest on, the bonds.  In the event of a default by PBC under the
reclaimed water agreement, FPL would have certain rights, including, among other
things, the right to appoint a third-party contractor to repair, and restore
operations of, the reclaimed water treatment plant, and, in the event of a
termination of the reclaimed water agreement by FPL relating to a PBC default,
the right to assume ownership of the reclaimed water pipeline from
PBC.  For financial reporting purposes, FPL is considered the owner of
the reclaimed water system and FPL and FPL Group are recording electric utility
plant in service and other property as costs are incurred and long-term debt as
costs are eligible for reimbursement by PBC to FPL (see table
above).

In 2009,
FPL Group sold $350 million of equity units (initially consisting of Corporate
Units).  Each equity unit has a stated amount of $50 and consists of a
purchase contract issued by FPL Group and, initially, a 1/20, or 5%, undivided
beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of a Series C Debenture
due June 1, 2014 issued by FPL Group Capital (see table
above).  Total annual distributions on the equity units will be at the
rate of 8.375%, consisting of interest on the debentures (3.60% per year) and
payments under the stock purchase contracts (4.775% per year).  The
interest rate on the debentures is expected to be reset on or after
December 1, 2011.  Each stock purchase contract will require the
holder to purchase FPL Group common stock for cash, which can be satisfied from
proceeds raised from remarketing the FPL Group Capital debentures, based on a
price per share range of $55.67 to $66.80 (subject to adjustment under certain
circumstances) no later than the settlement date of June 1,
2012.  The undivided beneficial ownership interest in the FPL Group
Capital debenture that is a component of each Corporate Unit is pledged to FPL
Group to secure the holder’s obligation to purchase common stock under the
related purchase contract.  If a successful remarketing does not occur
on or before the third business day prior to the settlement date, and a holder
has not notified FPL Group of its intention to settle the stock purchase
contract with cash, FPL Group would exercise its rights as a secured party in
the debentures to satisfy in full the holders’ obligations to purchase FPL Group
common stock under the related purchase contracts on the settlement
date.  The debentures are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by FPL
Group.

Prior to
the issuance of FPL Group's common stock, the purchase contracts will be
reflected in FPL Group's diluted earnings per share calculations using the
treasury stock method.  Under this method, the number of shares of FPL
Group common stock used in calculating diluted earnings per share is deemed to
be increased by the excess, if any, of the number of shares that would be issued
upon settlement of the purchase contracts over the number of shares that could
be purchased by FPL Group in the market, at the average market price during the
period, using the proceeds receivable upon settlement.

In
February 2010, FPL issued $500 million principal amount of 5.69% first mortgage
bonds maturing in 2040.

13.  Asset
Retirement Obligations

FPL's
ARO relates primarily to the nuclear decommissioning obligation of its nuclear
units.  FPL's AROs other than nuclear decommissioning are not
significant.  The accounting provisions result in timing differences
in the recognition of legal asset retirement costs for financial reporting
purposes and the method the FPSC allows FPL to recover in
rates.  NextEra Energy Resources' ARO relates primarily to the nuclear
decommissioning obligation of its nuclear plants and obligations for the
dismantlement of its wind facilities located on leased property.  See
Note 1 - Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlements of Plants and
Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs.

FPL
Group and FPL have identified but not recognized ARO liabilities related to
electric transmission and distribution and telecommunications assets resulting
from easements over property not owned by FPL Group or FPL.  In
addition, FPL Group has identified but not recognized ARO liabilities related to
the majority of NextEra Energy Resources' hydro facilities.  These
easements are generally perpetual and, along with the hydro facilities, only
require retirement action upon abandonment or cessation of use of the property
or facility for its specified purpose.  The ARO liability is not
estimable for such easements and hydro facilities as FPL Group and FPL intend to
use these properties and facilities indefinitely.  In the event FPL
Group and FPL decide to abandon or cease the use of a particular easement and/or
hydro facility, an ARO liability would be recorded at that
time.


14.  Commitments
and Contingencies

Commitments

- FPL Group and
its subsidiaries have made commitments in connection with a portion of their
projected capital expenditures.  Capital expenditures at FPL include,
among other things, the cost for construction or acquisition of additional
facilities and equipment to meet customer demand, as well as capital
improvements to and maintenance of existing facilities.  At NextEra
Energy Resources, capital expenditures include, among other things, the cost,
including capitalized interest, for construction of wind and solar projects and
the procurement of nuclear fuel.  FPL FiberNet, LLC's (FPL FiberNet)
capital expenditures primarily include costs to meet customer-specific
requirements and maintain its fiber-optic network.

At
December 31, 2009, estimated planned capital expenditures for 2010 through
2014 were estimated as follows:

FPL
Group has guaranteed certain payment obligations of FPL Group Capital, including
most payment obligations under FPL Group Capital's debt and
guarantees.  Additionally, at December 31, 2009, subsidiaries of
FPL Group, other than FPL, in the normal course of business, have guaranteed
certain debt service and fuel payments of non-consolidated entities of NextEra
Energy Resources.  The terms of the guarantees are equal to the terms
of the related agreements/contracts, with remaining terms ranging from less than
two years to nine years.  The maximum potential amount of future
payments that could be required under these guarantees at December 31, 2009
was approximately $54 million.  At December 31, 2009, FPL Group
did not have any liabilities recorded for these guarantees.  In
certain instances, FPL Group can seek recourse from third parties for amounts
paid under the guarantees.  At December 31, 2009, the fair value
of these guarantees was not material.


Contracts

- In addition to
the estimated planned capital expenditures included in the table in Commitments
above, FPL has commitments under long-term purchased power and fuel
contracts.  FPL is obligated under take-or-pay purchased power
contracts with JEA and with subsidiaries of The Southern Company (Southern
subsidiaries) to pay for approximately 1,300 mw of power annually through
mid-2010, approximately 1,330 mw annually from mid-2010 to mid-2015 and 375 mw
annually thereafter through 2021, and one of the Southern subsidiaries'
contracts is subject to minimum quantities.  FPL also has various firm
pay-for-performance contracts to purchase approximately 700 mw from certain
cogenerators and small power producers (qualifying facilities) with expiration
dates ranging from March 2010 through 2032.  The purchased power
contracts provide for capacity and energy payments.  Energy payments
are based on the actual power taken under these contracts.  Capacity
payments for the pay-for-performance contracts are subject to the qualifying
facilities meeting certain contract conditions.  FPL has one agreement
with an electricity supplier to purchase approximately 155 mw of power with an
expiration date of May 2012.  In general, the agreement requires FPL
to make a capacity payment and supply the fuel consumed by the plant under the
contract.  FPL has contracts with expiration dates through 2032 for
the purchase and transportation of natural gas and coal, and storage of natural
gas.

NextEra
Energy Resources has entered into several contracts primarily for the purchase
of wind turbines and towers, solar reflectors, steam generators and heat
collection elements and related construction activities, as well as for the
supply, conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel, with expiration
dates ranging from March 2010 through 2022, approximately $2.1 billion of which
is included in the estimated planned capital expenditures table in Commitments
above.  In addition, NextEra Energy Resources has contracts primarily
for the purchase, transportation and storage of natural gas and firm
transmission service with expiration dates ranging from March 2010 through
2033.

The
required capacity and/or minimum payments under these contracts as of
December 31, 2009 were estimated as follows:

In
addition, FPL has entered into several long-term agreements for storage capacity
and transportation of natural gas from facilities that have not yet started
construction or, if started, have not yet completed
construction.  These agreements range from 15 to 25 years in length
and contain firm commitments by FPL totaling up to approximately $175 million
annually or $4.3 billion over the terms of the agreements.  These firm
commitments are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, including
completion of construction of the facilities in 2011.

Insurance

- Liability
for accidents at nuclear power plants is governed by the Price-Anderson Act,
which limits the liability of nuclear reactor owners to the amount of insurance
available from both private sources and an industry retrospective payment
plan.  In accordance with this Act, FPL Group maintains $375 million
of private liability insurance per site, which is the maximum obtainable, and
participates in a secondary financial protection system, which provides up to
$12.6 billion of liability insurance coverage per incident at any nuclear
reactor in the United States.  Under the secondary financial
protection system, FPL Group is subject to retrospective assessments of up to
$940 million ($470 million for FPL), plus any applicable taxes, per incident at
any nuclear reactor in the United States, payable at a rate not to exceed $140
million ($70 million for FPL) per incident per year.  FPL Group and
FPL are contractually entitled to recover a proportionate share of such
assessments from the owners of minority interests in Seabrook, Duane Arnold and
St. Lucie Unit No. 2, which approximates $14 million, $35 million and $18
million, plus any applicable taxes, per incident, respectively.


FPL
Group participates in nuclear insurance mutual companies that provide $2.75
billion of limited insurance coverage per occurrence per site for property
damage, decontamination and premature decommissioning risks at its nuclear
plants.  The proceeds from such insurance, however, must first be used
for reactor stabilization and site decontamination before they can be used for
plant repair.  FPL Group also participates in an insurance program
that provides limited coverage for replacement power costs if a nuclear plant is
out of service for an extended period of time because of an
accident.  In the event of an accident at one of FPL Group's or
another participating insured's nuclear plants, FPL Group could be assessed up
to $175 million ($102 million for FPL), plus any applicable taxes, in
retrospective premiums.  FPL Group and FPL are contractually entitled
to recover a proportionate share of such assessments from the owners of minority
interests in Seabrook, Duane Arnold and St. Lucie Unit No. 2, which
approximates $2 million, $4 million and $4 million, plus any applicable taxes,
respectively.

Due to
the high cost and limited coverage available from third-party insurers, FPL does
not have insurance coverage for a substantial portion of its transmission and
distribution property and FPL Group has no insurance coverage for FPL FiberNet's
fiber-optic cable located throughout Florida.  Should FPL's future
storm restoration costs exceed the reserve amount established through the
issuance of storm-recovery bonds, FPL may recover storm restoration costs,
subject to prudence review by the FPSC, either through securitization provisions
pursuant to Florida law or through surcharges approved by the FPSC.

In the
event of a loss, the amount of insurance available might not be adequate to
cover property damage and other expenses incurred.  Uninsured losses
and other expenses, to the extent not recovered from customers in the case of
FPL, would be borne by FPL Group and FPL and could have a material adverse
effect on FPL Group's and FPL's financial condition and results of
operations.

Legal Proceedings

- In
November 1999, the Attorney General of the United States, on behalf of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), brought an action in the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of Georgia against Georgia Power Company and
other subsidiaries of The Southern Company for certain alleged violations of the
Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions and the New Source
Performance Standards (NSPS) of the Clean Air Act.  In May 2001, the
EPA amended its complaint to allege, among other things, that Georgia Power
Company constructed and is continuing to operate Scherer Unit No. 4, in
which FPL owns a 76% interest, without obtaining a PSD permit, without complying
with NSPS requirements, and without applying best available control technology
for nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides and particulate matter as required by the
Clean Air Act.  It also alleges that unspecified major modifications
have been made at Scherer Unit No. 4 that require its compliance with the
aforementioned Clean Air Act provisions.  The EPA seeks injunctive
relief requiring the installation of best available control technology and civil
penalties of up to $25,000 per day for each violation from an unspecified date
after June 1, 1975 through January 30, 1997.  The EPA has
made revisions to its civil penalty rule such that the maximum penalty is
$27,500 per day for each violation from January 31, 1997 through
March 15, 2004, $32,500 per day for each violation from March 16, 2004
through January 12, 2009 and $37,500 per day for each violation
thereafter.  Georgia Power Company has answered the amended complaint,
asserting that it has complied with all requirements of the Clean Air Act,
denying the plaintiff's allegations of liability, denying that the plaintiff is
entitled to any of the relief that it seeks and raising various other
defenses.  In June 2001, a federal district court stayed discovery and
administratively closed the case and the EPA has not yet moved to reopen the
case.  In April 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court in a separate unrelated
case rejected an argument that a "major modification" occurs at a plant only
when there is a resulting increase in the hourly rate of air
emissions.  Georgia Power Company has made a similar argument in
defense of its case, but has other factual and legal defenses that are
unaffected by the Supreme Court's decision.

In
February 2009, Florida Municipal Power Agency (FMPA) filed a petition for review
with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (DC Circuit) asking
the DC Circuit to reverse and remand orders of the FERC denying FMPA's request
for certain credits for transmission facilities owned by FMPA
members.  This matter arose from a 1993 FPL filing of a comprehensive
restructuring of its then-existing tariff structure.  All issues in
this case have been closed by the FERC.  If FMPA is successful in its
petition, any reduction in FPL's network service rates also would apply
effective January 1, 2004 to Seminole Electric Cooperative Inc. (Seminole),
FPL's other network customer.  FPL's position, which was approved by
the FERC, was to reduce its current network service rates by $0.04 per kilowatt
(kw) per month, which resulted in FPL issuing refunds of approximately $4
million to FMPA and $2 million to Seminole in March 2008.   FMPA's
position is that FPL's rates should be reduced by an additional $0.20 per kw per
month, which, if upheld, would result in an additional refund obligation to FMPA
of approximately $27 million, and approximately $17 million to Seminole, at
December 31, 2009.


In 1995
and 1996, FPL Group, through an indirect subsidiary, purchased from Adelphia
Communications Corporation (Adelphia) 1,091,524 shares of Adelphia common stock
and 20,000 shares of Adelphia preferred stock (convertible into 2,358,490 shares
of Adelphia common stock) for an aggregate price of approximately
$35,900,000.  On January 29, 1999, Adelphia repurchased all of
these shares for $149,213,130 in cash.  In June 2004, Adelphia,
Adelphia Cablevision, L.L.C. and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors
of Adelphia filed a complaint against FPL Group and its indirect subsidiary in
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York.  The
complaint alleges that the repurchase of these shares by Adelphia was a
fraudulent transfer, in that at the time of the transaction Adelphia (i) was
insolvent or was rendered insolvent, (ii) did not receive reasonably equivalent
value in exchange for the cash it paid, and (iii) was engaged or about to engage
in a business or transaction for which any property remaining with Adelphia had
unreasonably small capital.  The complaint seeks the recovery for the
benefit of Adelphia's bankruptcy estate of the cash paid for the repurchased
shares, plus interest.  FPL Group has filed an answer to the
complaint.  FPL Group believes that the complaint is without merit
because, among other reasons, Adelphia will be unable to demonstrate that (i)
Adelphia's repurchase of shares from FPL Group, which repurchase was at the
market value for those shares, was not for reasonably equivalent value, (ii)
Adelphia was insolvent at the time of the repurchase, or (iii) the repurchase
left Adelphia with unreasonably small capital.  The case is in
discovery and has been scheduled for trial in June 2011.

In
October 2004, TXU Portfolio Management Company (TXU) served FPL Energy
Pecos Wind I, LP, FPL Energy Pecos Wind I GP, LLC, FPL Energy Pecos Wind II, LP,
FPL Energy Pecos Wind II GP, LLC and Indian Mesa Wind Farm, LP (NextEra Energy
Resources Affiliates) as defendants in a civil action filed in the District
Court in Dallas County, Texas.  FPL Energy, LLC, now known as NextEra
Energy Resources, was added as a defendant in 2005.  The petition
alleged that the NextEra Energy Resources Affiliates had a contractual
obligation to produce and sell to TXU a minimum quantity of renewable energy
credits each year and that the NextEra Energy Resources Affiliates failed to
meet this obligation.  The plaintiff asserted claims for breach of
contract and declaratory judgment and sought damages of approximately $34
million.  The NextEra Energy Resources Affiliates filed their answer
and counterclaim in 2004, denying the allegations.  The counterclaim,
as amended, asserted claims for conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of
warranty, conspiracy, breach of contract and fraud and sought termination of the
contract and damages.  Following a jury trial in 2007, among other
findings, both TXU and the NextEra Energy Resources Affiliates were found to
have breached the contract.  In August 2008, the judge issued a final
judgment pursuant to which the contract is not terminated and neither party will
recover any damages.  In November 2008, TXU appealed the final
judgment to the Fifth District Court of Appeals in Dallas, Texas.

FPL
Group and FPL are vigorously defending, and believe that they or their
affiliates have meritorious defenses to, the lawsuits described
above.  In addition to the legal proceedings discussed above, FPL
Group and its subsidiaries, including FPL, are involved in other legal and
regulatory proceedings, actions and claims in the ordinary course of their
businesses.  Generating plants in which FPL Group or FPL have an
ownership interest are also involved in legal and regulatory proceedings,
actions and claims, the liabilities from which, if any, would be shared by FPL
Group or FPL.  In the event that FPL Group and FPL, or their
affiliates, do not prevail in the lawsuits described above or these other legal
and regulatory proceedings, actions and claims, there may be a material adverse

In
      the opinion of FPL Group and FPL, all adjustments, which consist of normal
      recurring accruals necessary to present a fair statement of the amounts

      for an interim period generally will not give a true indication of results
      for the year.

The
      sum of the quarterly amounts may not equal the total for the year due to

Item
9A.  Controls and Procedures

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

As of
December 31, 2009, each of FPL Group and FPL had performed an evaluation,
under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including
FPL Group's and FPL's chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of
the effectiveness of the design and operation of each company's disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) or
15d-15(e)).  Based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer
and chief financial officer of each of FPL Group and FPL concluded that the
company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting
them to material information relating to the company and its consolidated
subsidiaries required to be included in the company's reports filed or submitted
under the Exchange Act and ensuring that information required to be disclosed in
the company's reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to management, including its principal executive and principal
financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.  FPL Group and FPL each have a Disclosure Committee, which
is made up of several key management employees and reports directly to the chief
executive officer and chief financial officer of each company, to monitor and
evaluate these disclosure controls and procedures.  Due to the
inherent limitations of the effectiveness of any established disclosure controls
and procedures, management of FPL Group and FPL cannot provide absolute
assurance that the objectives of their respective disclosure controls and
procedures will be met.

In
accordance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, FPL Group's Audit Committee's pre-approval policy for services provided by
the independent auditor to FPL and the charter of the Audit Committee, all
services performed by Deloitte & Touche are approved in advance by the Audit
Committee, except for audits of certain employee benefit plans and trust funds
where the fees are paid by the plan or the trust.  Audit and
audit-related services specifically identified in an appendix to the
pre-approval policy are pre-approved by the Audit Committee each
year.  This pre-approval allows management to request the specified
audit and audit-related services on an as-needed basis during the year, provided
any such services are reviewed with the Audit Committee at its next regularly
scheduled meeting.  Any audit or audit-related service for which the
fee is expected to exceed $250,000, or that involves a service not listed on the
pre-approval list, must be specifically approved by the Audit Committee prior to
commencement of such work.  In addition, the Audit Committee approves
all services other than audit and audit-related services performed by Deloitte
& Touche in advance of the commencement of such work.  The Audit
Committee has delegated to the chairman of the committee the right to approve
audit, audit-related, tax and other services, within certain limitations,
between meetings of the Audit Committee, provided any such decision is presented
to the Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting.  The
Audit Committee reviews on a quarterly basis a schedule of all services for
which Deloitte & Touche has been engaged and the estimated fees for those
services.  In 2009 and 2008, no services provided to FPL Group or FPL
by Deloitte & Touche were approved by the Audit Committee after services
were rendered pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) of Regulation S-X (which
provides for a waiver of the otherwise applicable pre-approval requirement if
certain conditions are met).
