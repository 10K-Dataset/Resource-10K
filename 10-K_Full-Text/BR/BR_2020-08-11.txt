ITEM 1. Business

Overview

Broadridge, a Delaware corporation and a part of the S&P 500

®

Index (“S&P”), is a global financial technology leader providing investor communications and technology-driven solutions to banks, broker-dealers, asset and wealth managers and corporate issuers. With over 50 years of experience, including over 10 years as an independent public company, we provide financial services firms with advanced, dependable, scalable and cost-effective integrated solutions and an important infrastructure that powers the financial services industry. Our solutions enable better financial lives by powering investing, governance and communications and help reduce the need for our clients to make significant capital investments in operations infrastructure, thereby allowing them to increase their focus on core business activities.

Our services include investor communications, securities processing, data and analytics, and customer communications solutions. We serve a large and diverse client base across four client groups: banks/broker-dealers, asset management firms/mutual funds, wealth management firms and corporate issuers. For capital markets firms, we help our clients lower costs and improve the effectiveness of their trade and account processing operations with support for their operational technologies, and their administration, finance, risk and compliance requirements. We serve asset management firms by meeting their critical needs for shareholder communications and by providing investment operations technology to support their investment decisions. For wealth management clients, we provide an integrated platform with tools that optimize advisor productivity, enhance client experience, and digitize enterprise operations. For our corporate issuer clients, we help manage every aspect of their shareholder communications, including registered and beneficial proxy processing, annual meeting support, transfer agency services and financial disclosure document creation, management and SEC filing services.

We operate our business in two reportable segments: Investor Communication Solutions and Global Technology and Operations.

Investor Communication Solutions

We provide governance and communications solutions through our Investor Communication Solutions business segment to the following financial services clients: banks/broker-dealers, asset management firms/mutual funds, wealth management firms and corporate issuers. In addition to financial services firms, our Customer Communications business also serves companies in the healthcare, insurance, consumer finance, telecommunications, utilities and other service industries.

A large portion of our Investor Communication Solutions business involves the processing and distribution of proxy materials to investors in equity securities and mutual funds, as well as the facilitation of related vote processing. ProxyEdge

®

(“ProxyEdge”) is our innovative electronic proxy delivery and voting solution for institutional investors and financial advisors that helps ensure the voting participation of the largest stockholders of many companies. We also provide the distribution of regulatory reports and corporate action/reorganization event information, as well as tax reporting solutions that help our clients meet their regulatory compliance needs.

For asset managers and retirement service providers, we offer data-driven solutions and an end-to-end platform for content management, composition, and multi-channel distribution of regulatory, marketing, and transactional information. Our data and analytics solutions provide investment product distribution data, analytical tools, insights, and research to enable asset managers to optimize product distribution across retail and institutional channels globally. Through Matrix Financial Solutions, Inc. (“Matrix”), we provide mutual fund trade processing services for retirement service providers, third-party administrators, financial advisors, banks and wealth management professionals.

In addition, we provide public corporations and mutual funds with a full suite of solutions to help manage their annual meeting process, including registered and beneficial proxy distribution and processing services, proxy and annual report document management solutions, virtual shareholder meeting services, and solutions that help them gain insight into their shareholder base through our shareholder data services. We also offer financial reporting document composition and management solutions, SEC disclosure and filing services, and registrar, stock transfer and record-keeping services through Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions.

We provide customer communications solutions which include print and digital solutions, content management, postal optimization, and fulfillment services. These services include

customer communications management capabilities through the Broadridge Communications Cloud

SM

platform (the “Communications Cloud”). Through one point of integration, the Communications Cloud helps companies create, deliver, and manage multi-channel communications and customer engagement. The platform includes data-driven composition tools, identity and preference management, multi-channel optimization and digital communication experience, archive and information management, digital and print delivery, and analytics and reporting tools.


Global Technology and Operations

We are a leading global provider of securities processing solutions for capital markets, wealth management, and asset management firms. We offer advanced solutions that automate the securities transaction lifecycle, from desktop productivity tools, data aggregation, performance reporting, and portfolio management to order capture and execution, trade confirmation, margin, cash management, clearance and settlement, asset servicing, reference data management, reconciliations, securities financing and collateral optimization, compliance and regulatory reporting, and portfolio accounting and custody-related services.

Our core post-trade services help financial institutions efficiently and cost-effectively consolidate their books and records, gather and service assets under management and manage risk, thereby enabling them to focus on their core business activities. Provided on a software as a service (“SaaS”) basis within large user communities, our technology is a global solution, processing clearance and settlement in over 100 countries. Our multi-asset, multi-market, multi-entity and multi-currency solutions support real-time global trade processing of equity, fixed income, mutual fund, foreign exchange, and exchange traded derivative

s. We process on average over $8 trillion in equity and fixed income trades per day of United States of America (“U.S.”) and Canadian securities.

Our comprehensive wealth management platform offers capabilities across the entire wealth management lifecycle and streamlines all aspects of wealth management services, including account management, fee management and client on-boarding. The wealth management platform enables full-service, regional and independent broker-dealers and investment advisors to better engage with customers through digital marketing and customer communications tools. We also integrate data, content and technology to drive new customer acquisition, support holistic advice and cross-sell opportunities through the creation of sales and educational content, including seminars as well as customizable advisor websites, search engine marketing and electronic and print newsletters. Our advisor solutions help advisors optimize their practice management through customer and account data aggregation and reporting. We currently support over 200,000 professionals at more than 300 financial firms with our wealth management solutions.

We offer buy-side techn

ology solutions for the global investment management industry, including portfolio management, compliance and operational workflow solutions for hedge funds, family offices, investment managers and the providers that service this space. Through our Managed Services, we provide business process outsourcing services that support the entire trade lifecycle operations of our buy- and sell-side clients’ businesses through a combination of our technology and our operations expertise. We also provide support for advisor, investor and compliance workflow.

Our Strategy

We earn our clients’ confidence every day by delivering real business value through leading technology-driven solutions that help our clients get ahead of today’s challenges and capitalize on future growth opportunities. Our solutions harness people, technology and insights to help transform our clients’ businesses by enriching customer engagement, navigating risk, optimizing efficiency and growing revenue.

As financial institutions look to transform and mutualize their mission-critical but non-differentiating operational and support functions, we have the proven technology, scale, innovation, experience and, most importantly, the clients to achieve this goal and meet their needs. We define our market opportunity in our strong and growing global businesses in both governance and communications and capital markets, with an additional growth platform in wealth and investment management. Our growth strategy is based on the following key components.

Our business model.

We deliver multi-client technology and managed services primarily through common SaaS-based operations platforms. We increasingly create layers of value by driving network benefits to our clients, providing deep data and analytics solutions, and offering a suite of digital capabilities on a single platform. All of this translates into our core value proposition to be a trusted provider of technology and managed services across a range of analytical, operational and reporting functions. Our SaaS offerings allow our clients to mutualize development expenses and our solutions integrate global data services to provide globally-consistent insight to functions and requirements within the financial services industry.


Strong positions in a large and growing financial services market.

Our deep industry knowledge enables our clients to successfully solve complex technological challenges, and inspires trust among and brings novel perspectives to our clients. While financial services firms have historically kept much of their technology infrastructure work in-house, there are two significant trends working in favor of Broadridge. In aggregate, financial service firms globally are spending more on technology, and the respective budgets allocated are consistently growing year-over-year. Moreover, these firms are devoting a growing percentage of this spend to third-party technology, operations, and services. Broadridge, as a trusted outside partner, can undertake streamlining and better integrate this infrastructure and processes. We expect the efficiencies that result from such undertaking by Broadridge will lead to growth in the market for our solutions.

Three attractive growth platforms.

Our growth platforms address important and significant client needs as described below. Through our integrated solutions and services and our scalable infrastructure, we believe we are best positioned to meet them.

•

Governance

. We provide a strong network through our governance platform that links broker-dealers, public companies, mutual funds, shareholders, and regulators. We continue to grow our governance solutions by continuing to transform content and delivery and improve product capabilities to drive higher investor engagement. We aim to be an integral partner to asset managers and retirement service providers by offering data-driven solutions that help them grow revenue, reduce costs and maintain compliance. We are also expanding our capabilities to better serve the needs of issuers and we are driving the next generation of digital communications while optimizing print and mail services through advanced technology.

•

Capital Markets

. Global institutions have a strong need to simplify their complex technology environment, and our SaaS-based global, multi-asset class technology platform addresses this need. We are driving global post-trade management to create transformation opportunities to simplify our clients’ operations, improve performance, evolve to global operating models, adopt new technologies, and enable our clients to better manage their data.

•

Wealth Management

.

Wealth management clients including full-service, regional and independent broker-dealers, investment advisors, insurance companies and retirement solutions providers are all undergoing unprecedented change. These firms are in need of partners to help them navigate the demographic shift of advisors and investors, the large generational transference of wealth and the aging of

the client experience and operational

technologies that are essential to their business. These market dynamics are driving the need to more seamlessly integrate technology and processes and access to data-centric digital wealth solutions to better service advisors and investors. This can only be achieved by modernizing their core technology infrastructure. To address this need, we have developed a holistic wealth management platform solution that provides seamless systems and data integration capabilities and enables firms to improve advisor productivity, investor experience and operational process efficiencies.

On-ramp for next-generation technologies.

Our clients understand that next-generation technology is a key driving force for change and efficiency and there is a need among our client base to leverage this technology to address their critical business challenges. However, they face obstacles in creating the right investment and, more importantly, in applying the right talent and intellectual capital, which may be focused on their most differentiating functions. This continues to create opportunities for Broadridge to assist in the areas where we have scale and domain expertise, which includes digital, cloud, blockchain, and artificial intelligence technologies.

High engagement and client-centric culture.

Broadridge is client-centric and has created and grown multi-entity infrastructures across a variety of functions with high client satisfaction. Broadridge conducts a client satisfaction survey for each of its major business units annually, the results of which are a component of all Broadridge associates’ compensation because of the importance of client retention to the achievement of Broadridge’s revenue goals.

We have also built a culture where we focus on having engaged and knowledgeable associates to serve clients well, which in turn creates a real and sustainable advantage. Supporting this excellent client delivery takes engaged associates, and we are passionate about creating an environment in which every associate can thrive and build their knowledge and skills. All of this creates a culture that benefits our associates, our clients, and our stockholders.


History and Development of Our Company

Broadridge has over 50 years of history in providing innovative solutions to financial services firms and publicly-held companies. We are the former Brokerage Services division of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (“ADP”), which opened for business in 1962 with one client, processing an average of 300 trades per night. In 1979, ADP expanded its U.S.-based securities processing solutions to process Canadian securities. Broadridge was incorporated in Delaware as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ADP on March 29, 2007 in anticipation of our spin-off from ADP. We spun off from ADP and began operating as an independent public company on March 30, 2007. In January 2019, Timothy C. Gokey succeeded Richard J. Daly as Chief Executive Officer of Broadridge.

Investor Communication Solutions

We began offering our proxy services in 1989. The proxy services business, which has become our Investor Communication Solutions business, leveraged the information processing systems and infrastructure of our Global Technology and Operations business. Our proxy services offering attracted 31 major clients in its first year of operations. In 1992, we acquired The Independent Election Corporation of America which further increased our proxy services capabilities. By 1999, we were handling over 90% of the investor communication distributions for securities held of record by banks and broker-dealers in the U.S. from proxy statements to annual reports. During the 1990s, we expanded our proxy services business to serve security owners of Canadian and United Kingdom issuers and we began offering a complete outsourced solution for international proxies.

In 1994, we began offering ProxyEdge, our innovative electronic proxy delivery and voting solution for institutional investors that helps ensure the participation of the largest stockholders of many companies. In 1998, having previously provided print and distribution services as an accommodation to our securities processing and proxy clients, we began offering account statement and reporting services. In 2001, we developed and released an electronic document distribution and archiving solution of all investor communications.

We have made several acquisitions to improve and expand the solutions offered through our Investor Communication Solutions segment.  For our asset management clients, we acquired Access Data Corp. in 2009 to build-out our data and analytics offerings. We made additional acquisitions adding new global data, insight, and compliance capabilities for our global asset management clients.

We continued to expand our services for asset managers and mutual funds through the acquisition of Matrix, a provider of mutual fund trade processing services for retirement service providers, third party administrators, financial advisors, banks and wealth management professionals in 2011. Matrix’s operational, trust, custody, trading and mutual fund and exchanged traded funds (“ETFs”) settlement services strengthened Broadridge’s role as a provider of data processing and distribution channel solutions to the mutual fund industry. We increased the breadth of Matrix’s offerings and enhanced its operational scale through the acquisition of a trade processing business and the acquisition of retirement plan custody and trust assets from TD Ameritrade Trust Company (“TD Ameritrade”), a subsidiary of TD Ameritrade Holding Company. In addition, we expanded our North American fund industry solutions with European fund compliance solutions through the acquisitions of FundAssist Limited (“FundAssist”) and FundsLibrary Limited (“FundsLibrary”).

In 2016, we expanded our communications solutions through the acquisition of the North American Customer Communications (“NACC”) business of DST Systems, Inc., which was renamed Broadridge Customer Communications and integrated into our then existing customer communications business. The combination further enhanced our position as a leading provider of print and digital communications.

In 2017, we added to our corporate issuer solutions with the acquisition of Summit Financial Disclosure, LLC (“Summit”), a full-service financial document management solutions provider. We integrated Summit’s document composition and regulatory filing services with our proxy voting and shareholder communications services to create an end-to-end solution for corporate issuers that spans the entire corporate disclosure lifecycle from private funding, through capital markets transactions and year-round SEC reporting and communications to shareholders.

In 2019, we acquired Fi360, Inc. (“Fi360”) a provider of fiduciary and Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) Regulation Best Interest (“Regulation BI”) solutions for the wealth and retirement industry. Fi360 enhances our retirement solutions by providing wealth and retirement advisors with fiduciary tools that complement our Matrix trust and trading platform.


Global Technology and Operations

Our Global Technology and Operations business has evolved over the past 50 years from being a processer of U.S. and Canadian securities to a global provider of multi-market, multi-asset class, multi-entity and multi-currency technology solutions and services. This evolution has occurred through a combination of ongoing organic product development and focused acquisitions that have expanded and enhanced the capabilities of our solutions and the markets

we serve.

We made significant additions to our Global Technology and Operations business through two key acquisitions in the mid-1990s. In 1995, we acquired a London-based provider of multi-currency clearance and settlement services, to become a global supplier of transaction processing services. In 1996, we acquired a provider of institutional fixed income transaction processing systems.

Our Managed Services business was launched in 2005 with the acquisition of the Bank of America Corporation’s U.S. Clearing and BrokerDealer Services business. Over the years, we have expanded the asset class, geographic and market segment coverage of our Managed Services. Expanded asset classes include futures, over-the-counter derivatives, and non-dollar and fixed income securities. In addition, we added fee billing for all asset classes and we now support asset managers and entities outside the U.S.

For our capital markets solutions, we added reconciliations and matching capabilities with the acquisition of CityNetworks Ltd. in 2010. We broadened our global securities financing and collateral management capabilities through the acquisitions of 4sight Financial Software Limited and Anetics, Inc. in 2016. In 2017, we acquired Message Automation Limited, extending our regulatory and compliance capabilities for capital markets firms. Most recently, we acquired Shadow Financial Systems, Inc. (“Shadow Financial”) in 2019, which added a market-ready solution for exchanges, inter-dealer brokers and proprietary trading firms, as well as additional capabilities in exchange traded derivatives and cryptocurrency.

For our wealth management solutions,

we have made a series of acquisitions that have broadened our suite of wealth-focused technology and advisor communications solutions for broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers and banks. In 2010, we acquired Forefield, Inc., which has been consolidated with

Emerald Connect, LLC, acquired in 2014,

to provide financial advisors with content and tools to communicate with their customers. In 2016, we acquired M&O Systems, Inc., and in 2019 we acquired Financial Database Services, Inc. These acquisitions have made Broadridge the leading provider of advisor compensation management solutions, as well as strengthened our compliance and advisor onboarding capabilities. In  2019, we acquired Rockall Technologies Limited (“Rockall”) and expanded our core front-to-back wealth management capabilities, providing innovative securities-based lending (“SBL”) and collateral management technology solutions to help commercial banks manage risk and optimize clients’ securities lending and financing needs. In 2019, we acquired RPM Technologies (“RPM”), a Canadian provider of enterprise wealth management software solutions and services. The addition of RPM’s state-of-the-art technology platforms builds upon our Canadian wealth management business, providing a solution set for the retail banking sector with enhanced mutual fund and deposit manufacturing capabilities.

For our asset management solutions, we

expanded our securities processing solutions to service buy-side firms with the acquisition of

Paladyne Systems in 2011,

a provider of an integrated operational solutions platform that provides hedge funds, hedge fund administrators, and asset management firms with mission critical applications to streamline and manage their businesses. In 2013, we expanded our suite of asset management solutions through the acquisition of Bonaire Software Solutions, LLC, a provider of fee calculation, billing, and revenue and expense management solutions. In 2015, we acquired QED Financial Systems, Inc., a provider of investment accounting and data management solutions to institutional investors and asset management firms.

In 2019, we acquired ClearStructure Financial Technology, LLC (“ClearStructure”), a global provider of portfolio management solutions for the private debt markets.

The Broadridge Business

Investor Communication Solutions

The Investor Communication Solutions segment’s revenues represented approximately 77% and 80% of our total Revenues in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively, which gives effect to the foreign exchange impact from revenues generated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. See “Analysis of Reportable Segments — Revenues” under “Item 701. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The services and solutions provided through our Investor Communication Solutions segment serve the following client groups:


Banks/Broker-Dealers

We handle the entire proxy materials distribution and voting process for our bank and broker-dealer clients. We offer traditional hard copy and electronic services for the delivery of proxy materials to investors and collection of consents; maintenance of a database that contains the delivery method preferences of our clients’ customers; posting of documents on the Internet; e-mail notification to investors notifying them that proxy materials are available; and proxy voting over the Internet, mobile devices and tablets. We also have the ability to combine stockholder communications for multiple stockholders residing at the same address which we accomplish by having ascertained the delivery preferences of investors. In addition, we provide a complete outsourced solution for the processing of international proxies with the ability to process proxy voting in over 120 international markets.

A majority of publicly-traded shares are not registered in companies’ records in the names of their ultimate beneficial owners. Instead, a substantial majority of all public companies’ shares are held in “street name,” meaning that they are held of record by broker-dealers or banks through their depositories. Most street name shares are registered in the name “Cede & Co.,” the name used by The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”), which holds shares on behalf of its participant broker-dealers and banks. These participant broker-dealers and banks (which are known as “Nominees” because they hold securities in name only) in turn hold the shares on behalf of their clients, the individual beneficial owners. Nominees, upon request, are required to provide companies with lists of beneficial owners who do not object to having their names, addresses, and shareholdings supplied to companies, so called “non-objecting beneficial owners” (or “NOBOs”). Objecting beneficial owners (or “OBOs”) may be contacted directly only by the broker-dealer or bank. As DTCC’s role is only as the custodian, a number of mechanisms have been developed in order to pass the legal rights it holds as the record owner (such as the right to vote) to the beneficial owners. The first step in passing voting rights down the chain is the “omnibus proxy,” which DTCC executes to transfer its voting rights to its participant Nominees. Under applicable rules, Nominees must deliver proxy materials to beneficial owners and request voting instructions.

Given the large number of Nominees involved in the beneficial proxy process resulting from the large number of beneficial shareholders, we play a unique, central and integral role in ensuring that the beneficial proxy process occurs without issue for both Nominees and companies. A large number of Nominees have contracted out the processes of distributing proxy materials and tabulating voting instructions to us. Nominees accomplish this by entering into agreements with Broadridge and transferring to us via powers of attorney the authority to execute a proxy, which authority the Nominee receives from the DTCC via an omnibus proxy. Through our agreements with Nominees for the provision of beneficial proxy services, we take on the responsibility of ensuring that the account holders of Nominees receive proxy materials, that their voting instructions are conveyed to the companies conducting solicitations and that these services are fulfilled in accordance with each company’s requirements with respect to its particular solicitation. In order for us to provide the beneficial proxy services effectively, we interface and coordinate directly with each company to ensure that the services are performed in an accurate and acceptable manner. With respect to companies, as it would be impracticable and would also increase the costs for companies to work with all of the Nominees through which their shares are held beneficially, companies work with us for the performance of all the tasks and processes necessary to ensure that proxy materials are distributed to all beneficial owners and that their votes are accurately reported.

The SEC rules require public companies to reimburse Nominees for the expense of distributing stockholder communications to beneficial owners of securities held in street name. The reimbursement rates are set forth in the rules of self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”), including the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). We bill public companies for the proxy services performed, collect the fees and remit to the Nominee its portion of the fees. In addition, the NYSE rules establish fees specifically for the services provided by intermediaries in the proxy process, such as Broadridge. We also compile NOBO lists on behalf of Nominees in response to requests from corporate issuers. The preparation of NOBO lists is subject to reimbursement by the securities issuers requesting such lists to the broker-dealers. The reimbursement rates are based on the number of NOBOs on the list produced pursuant to NYSE or other SRO rules. The rules also provide for certain fees to be paid to third-party intermediaries who compile NOBO lists. We function as an intermediary in the NOBO process.

We provide institutional investors with a suite of services to manage the entire proxy voting process, including fulfilling their fiduciary obligations and meeting their reporting needs. ProxyEdge is our innovative electronic proxy delivery and voting solution for institutional investors and financial advisors that integrates ballots for positions held across multiple custodians and presents them under a single proxy. Voting can be instructed for the entire position, by account vote group or on an individual account basis either manually or automatically based on the recommendations of participating governance research providers. ProxyEdge also provides for client reporting and regulatory reporting. ProxyEdge can be utilized for meetings of U.S. and Canadian companies and for meetings in many non-North American countries based on the holdings of our global custodian clients. ProxyEdge is offered in several languages and there are currently over 5,600 ProxyEdge users worldwide.


In addition to our proxy services, we provide our bank and broker-dealer clients with regulatory communications services including prospectus delivery services. Our proprietary extraction, normalization and presentment capabilities from the SEC’s EDGAR database have enabled us to provide our bank and broker-dealer and asset management clients with an on-demand solution for prospectus post-sale fulfillment. This process provides efficiency for our clients as it reduces their reliance on offset print and fund delivered inventory. We provide portfolio-specific solutions for the retirement and annuity markets. We have integrated this functionality into additional capabilities to offer an efficient fulfillment model for regulatory and compliance distributions.

We also offer a complete reorganization communications solution to notify investors of reorganizations or corporate action events such as tender offers, mergers and acquisitions, bankruptcies, and class action lawsuits. We also offer our Mailbox products - Advisor Mailbox

™

and Investor Mailbox

®

- which support and complement any investor communication strategy. Our Investor Mailbox solution provides the electronic delivery of investor communications to our clients’ websites or mobile apps, enabling investor access to regulatory delivery notices, day-to-day account and investment information and convenient response tools. Our Advisor Mailbox is an electronic communications platform for financial advisors that delivers immediate electronic access to the communications and documents sent to such advisors’ customers. Advisor Mailbox streamlines multiple communication paths for all investor-related documents into a single-visit portal that is integrated onto an advisor’s platform.

Asset Management Firms/Mutual Funds

We provide a full range of data-driven solutions that help our asset management and retirement services clients grow revenue, operate efficiently, and maintain compliance.

International Solutions

We provide regulatory and communications solutions addressing clients’ needs within Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and the Asia-Pacific region (“APAC”). Our offerings help clients address evolving requirements for stronger governance, greater transparency and improved insights derived from data analytics. These solutions are a direct extension of our U.S. and Canadian businesses and in many cases serve the same client base. Our international solutions help clients sharpen focus on their core businesses while helping them maintain regulatory compliance, reduce costs, improve efficiency and gain data insights.

Our Global Proxy solution includes services similar to those provided by our U.S. and Canadian proxy businesses. In September 2020, the European Union will adopt the Shareholder Rights Directive II (“SRD II”), which will increase engagement between corporate issuers and beneficial owners. We have designed and implemented a SRD II component of our Global Proxy solution for both custodians and wealth managers.

Our fiscal year 2020 acquisition of FundsLibrary has added the capabilities to provide fund document and data dissemination in the European market. FundsLibrary links fund managers to distributors and investors to provide complete, accurate and timely information supporting fund sales. The solution helps fund managers increase distribution opportunities, comply with both United Kingdom domestic and European Union regulations such as Solvency II and MiFID II, and makes information easily accessible for investors in digital format.

FundsLibrary has been combined with the FundAssist business we acquired in 2018 to form

Fund Communication Solutions. The combined solution provides funds with a single, integrated provider to manage data, perform calculations, compose documents, manage regulatory compliance and disseminate information across multiple jurisdictions.


Global Technology and Operations

Transactions involving securities and other financial market instruments originate with an investor, who places an order with a broker who in turn routes that order to an appropriate market for execution. At that point, the parties to the transaction coordinate payment and settlement of the transaction through a clearinghouse. The records of the parties involved must then be updated to reflect completion of the transaction. Tax, custody, accounting and record-keeping requirements must be complied with in connection with the transaction and the customer’s account information must correctly reflect the transaction. The accurate processing of trading activity and custody activity requires effective automation and information flow across multiple systems and functions within the brokerage firm and across the systems of the various parties that participate in the execution of a transaction.

Our Global Technology and Operations segment provides solutions that automate the securities transaction lifecycle of equity, mutual fund, fixed income, foreign exchange and exchange traded derivatives, from order capture and execution through trade confirmation, margin, cash management, clearing and settlement, reference data management, reconciliations, securities financing and collateral management, asset servicing, compliance and regulatory reporting, portfolio accounting and custody-related services. Our solutions provide automated straight through processing operations and enable buy- and sell-side financial institutions to efficiently and cost-effectively consolidate their books and records, gather and service assets under management, focus on their core businesses, and manage risk. With our multi-market, multi-asset class, multi-entity and multi-currency capabilities, we provide post-trade processing on a global basis.

The Global Technology and Operations segment’s revenues represented approximately 26% and 23% of our total Revenues in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively, which gives effect to the foreign exchange impact from revenues generated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. See “Analysis of Reportable Segments — Revenues” under “Item 701. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Services and solutions offered through the Global Technology and Operations segment include the following:

Capital Markets Solutions

We provide a set of sophisticated, multi-entity and multi-currency systems that support real-time processing of securities transactions in North American equities, options, fixed income securities, and mutual funds. Our core post-trade processing systems support real-time processing of primarily equity and option transactions in the U.S. and Canadian markets. Our post-trade processing platform is provided on a SaaS basis and handles the entire securities processing cycle from order management to clearance, settlement and custody, and assists our clients in meeting their regulatory reporting and other post-trade requirements.

Asset Management Solutions

We provide buy-side technology solutions for the global investment management industry. Our asset management solutions are portfolio management, compliance and operational support solutions such as order management, data warehousing, reporting, reference data management, risk management and portfolio accounting for hedge funds, family offices, investment managers and the providers that service this space including prime brokers, hedge fund administrators and custodians. The client base for these services includes institutional asset managers, public funds, start-up or emerging managers through some of the largest global hedge fund complexes and global fund administrators. We have integrated our business process outsourcing expertise with our investment management solutions to offer a set of managed services to asset management firms.

Managed Services

Our business process outsourcing services support the operations of our buy- and sell-side clients’ businesses. These services combine our technology with our operations expertise to support the entire trade lifecycle, including securities clearing and settlement, reconciliations, record-keeping, asset servicing, and custody-related functions.

International Solutions

We provide advanced real-time, multi-asset and multi-currency post-trade processing solutions to support the processing of a broad range of equity, fixed income, foreign exchange and exchange traded derivative securities for global financial institutions. We primarily offer these services on a SaaS basis and support clearance and settlement activities in over 90 countries with direct connectivity solutions in the major markets.

We have also acquired and developed a series of solutions that are directly adjacent to our post-trade processing services. These services include reference data management, securities financing, securities-based lending, collateral management, trade and transaction reporting, reconciliations, financial messaging and asset servicing. Our solutions can be deployed as a complete post-trade service as well as discrete components supporting financial institutions.

Clients

We serve a large and diverse client base across four client groups: banks/broker-dealers, asset management firms/mutual funds, corporate issuers and wealth management firms. Our clients in the financial services industry include retail and institutional brokerage firms, global banks, mutual funds, asset managers, insurance companies,

annuity companies, institutional investors, specialty trading firms, clearing firms, third-party administrators, hedge funds, and financial advisors. Our corporate issuer clients are typically publicly held companies. In addition to financial services firms, our Customer Communications business services other corporate clients in the healthcare, insurance, consumer finance, telecommunications, utilities, and other service industries with their essential communications.


In fiscal year 2020, we:

•

processed approximately 80% of the outstanding shares in the U.S. in the performance of our proxy services;

•

processed over 6 billion investor and customer communications through print and digital channels;

•

processed on average over $8 trillion in equity and fixed income trades per day of U.S. and Canadian securities;

and

•

provided fixed income trade processing services to 19 of the 24 primary dealers of fixed income securities in the U.S.

In fiscal year 2020, we derived approximately 20% of our consolidated revenues from five clients. Our largest single client accounted for approximately 6% of our consolidated revenues.

Competition

We operate in a highly competitive industry. Our Investor Communication Solutions business competes with companies that provide investor communication and corporate governance solutions including proxy services providers, transfer agents, proxy advisory firms, proxy solicitation firms and financial printers. We also face competition from numerous firms in the compiling, printing and electronic distribution of statements, bills, and other customer communications. Our Global Technology and Operations business principally competes with brokerage firms that perform their trade processing in-house, and with numerous other outsourcing vendors. Our back-office support services offered through this segment also compete with very large financial institutions that manage their own back-office record-keeping operations.

Technology

We have several information processing systems which serve as the core foundation of our technology platform. We leverage these systems in order to provide our services. We are committed to maintaining extremely high levels of quality service through our skilled technical employees and the use of our technology within an environment that seeks continual improvement.

Our mission-critical applications are designed to provide high levels of availability, scalability, reliability, and flexibility. They operate on industry standard enterprise architecture platforms that provide high degrees of horizontal and vertical scaling. This scalability and redundancy allows us to provide high degrees of system availability. In 2010, we entered into an Information Technology Services Agreement (the “IT Services Agreement”) with International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”),

which was amended and restated in 2019 (the “Amended IT Services Agreement”). Under the Amended IT Services Agreement, IBM performs a broad range of technology services including supporting our mainframe, midrange,  network and data center operations, as well as providing disaster recovery services.

In 2014, the Company and IBM United Kingdom Limited (“IBM UK”) entered into an Information Technology Services Agreement (the “EU IT Services Agreement”), which was amended in 2019 (the “Amended EU IT Services Agreement”). Under the Amended EU IT Services Agreement, IBM UK provides data center services supporting the Company’s technology outsourcing services for certain clients in Europe and Asia.

In 2019, we entered into an information technology agreement with IBM for private cloud services (the “IBM Private Cloud Agreement”) under which IBM will operate, manage and support the Company’s private cloud global distributed platforms and products, and operate and manage certain Company networks.

Most of our systems and applications process in highly resilient data centers that employ multiple active power and cooling distribution paths, redundant components, and are capable of providing 99.995% availability. Additionally, the data centers provide infrastructure capacity and capability to permit any planned activity without disruption to the critical load, and can sustain at least one worst-case, unplanned failure or event with no critical load impact. Our geographically dispersed processing centers also provide disaster recovery and business continuity processing.

Product Development.

Our products and services are designed with reliability, availability, scalability, and flexibility so that we can fully meet our clients’ processing needs. These applications are built in a manner which allows us to meet the breadth and depth of requirements of our financial services industry clients in a highly efficient manner. We continually upgrade, enhance, and expand our existing products and services taking into account input from clients, industry-wide initiatives and regulatory changes affecting our clients.


Intellectual Property.

We own a portfolio of more than 110 U.S. and non-U.S. patent and patent applications. We also own registered marks for our trade name and own or have applied for trademark registrations for many of our services and products. We regard our products and services as proprietary and utilize internal security practices and confidentiality restrictions in contracts with employees, clients, and others for protection. We believe that we are the owner or in some cases, the licensee, of all intellectual property and other proprietary rights necessary to conduct our business.

Cybersecurity

Our information security program is designed to meet the needs of our clients who entrust us with their sensitive information. Our program includes encryption, data masking technology, data loss prevention technology, authentication technology, entitlement management, access control, anti-malware software, and transmission of data over private networks, among other systems and procedures designed to protect against unauthorized access to information, including by cyber-attacks. In addition, we conduct regular security awareness training as well as testing for our employees.

To further demonstrate our commitment to maintaining the highest levels of quality service, information security, and client satisfaction within an environment that fosters continual improvement, most of our business units and our core applications and facilities for the provision of many services including our proxy services, U.S. equity and fixed income securities processing services, and IBM’s data centers, are International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 27001 certified. This security standard specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and improving a documented Information Security Management System within the context of the organization’s overall business risks. It specifies the requirements for the implementation of security controls customized to the needs of individual organizations. This standard addresses confidentiality, access control, vulnerability, business continuity, and risk assessment.

Additionally, Broadridge is utilizing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (the “NIST Framework”) issued by the U.S. government in 2014 and updated in 2018, as a guideline to manage our cybersecurity-related risk. The NIST Framework outlines 108 subcategories of security controls and outcomes over five functions: identify, protect, detect, respond and recover.

Regulation

The securities and financial services industries are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions. As a matter of public policy, regulatory bodies in the U.S. and the rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of investors participating in those markets. Due to the nature of our services and the markets we serve, these regulatory bodies impact our businesses in the following various manners.

In the U.S., the securities and financial services industries are subject to regulation under both federal and state laws. At the federal level, the SEC regulates the securities industry, along with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”), the various stock exchanges, and other SROs. The Department of Labor (“DOL”) enforces the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) regulations on fiduciaries and organizations that provide services to retirement plans such as Matrix.

As a

provider of services to financial institutions and issuers of securities, our services, such as our proxy and shareholder report processing and distribution services, are provided in a manner to assist our clients in complying with the laws and regulations to which they are subject. As a result, the services we provide may be required to change as applicable laws and regulations are adopted or revised. We monitor legislative and rulemaking activity by the SEC, FINRA, DOL, the stock exchanges and other regulatory bodies that may impact our services, and if new laws or regulations are adopted or changes are made to existing laws or regulations applicable to our services, we expect to adapt our business practices and service offerings to continue to assist our clients in fulfilling their obligations under new or modified requirements.

Certain aspects of our business are subject to regulatory compliance or oversight. As a provider of technology services to financial institutions, certain aspects of our U.S. operations are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”), an interagency body of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the National Credit Union Administration and various state regulatory authorities. Periodic examinations by the FFIEC generally include areas such as data privacy, disaster recovery, information security, and third-party vendor management to identify potential risks related to our services that could adversely affect our banking and financial services clients.


In addition, our business process outsourcing, mutual fund processing and transfer agency solutions, as well as the entities providing those services, are subject to regulatory oversight. Our business process outsourcing and mutual fund processing services are performed by a broker-dealer, Broadridge Business Process Outsourcing, LLC (“BBPO”). BBPO is registered with the SEC, is a member of FINRA and is required to participate in the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”). Although BBPO’s FINRA membership agreement allows it to engage in clearing, and the retailing of corporate securities in addition to mutual fund retailing on a wire order basis, BBPO does not clear customer transactions, process any retail business or carry customer accounts. BBPO is subject to regulations concerning many aspects of its business, including trade practices, capital requirements, record retention, money laundering prevention, the protection of customer funds and customer securities, and the supervision of the conduct of directors, officers and employees. A failure to comply with any of these laws, rules or regulations could result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, or the suspension or revocation of SEC or FINRA authorization granted to allow the operation of its business or disqualification of its directors, officers or employees. There has been continual regulatory scrutiny of the securities industry including the outsourcing by firms of their operations or functions. This oversight could result in the future enactment of more restrictive laws or rules with respect to business process outsourcing. As a registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA, BBPO is subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule 15c3-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which requires BBPO to maintain a minimum net capital amount. At June 30, 2020, BBPO was in compliance with this capital requirement.

BBPO, as a “Managing Clearing Member” of the Options Clearing Corporation (the “OCC”), is also subject to OCC Rule 309(b) with respect to the business process outsourcing services that it provides to other OCC “Managed Clearing Member” broker-dealers. OCC Rule 309(b) requires that BBPO maintain a minimum net capital amount. At June 30, 2020, BBPO was in compliance with this capital requirement.

Matrix Trust Company (“Matrix Trust”), is a Colorado State non-depository trust company and National Securities Clearing Corporation trust member, whose primary business is to provide cash agent, custodial and directed trustee services to institutional customers, and investment management services to collective investment trust funds (“CITs”). As a result, Matrix Trust is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Colorado Division of Banking and the Arizona Department of Financial Institutions, as well as the National Securities Clearing Corporation. Specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items, when applicable, must be met. At June 30, 2020, Matrix Trust was in compliance with its capital requirements. In addition, in connection with the offering of CITs, Matrix Trust acts as a discretionary trustee and an ERISA fiduciary. CITs are subject to regulation by the IRS, federal and state banking regulators, and ERISA, which impose a number of duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA. Matrix Trust is also subject to regulation by the Colorado Division of Banking and the Arizona Department of Financial Institutions which regulate the CITs pursuant to Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulation.

Our transfer agency business, Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, is subject to certain SEC rules and regulations, including annual reporting, examination, internal controls, proper safeguarding of issuer and shareholder funds and securities, and obligations relating to its operations. Our transfer agency business has been formally approved by the NYSE to act as a transfer agent or registrar for issuers of NYSE listed securities and as a result, it is subject to certain NYSE requirements concerning operational standards. Furthermore, it is also subject to U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) regulations, as well as certain provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) and the Federal Trade Commission’s (the “FTC”) regulations with respect to maintenance of information security safeguards. In addition, certain state laws govern certain services performed by our transfer agency business.

In addition, our regulated businesses are required to comply with anti-money laundering laws and regulations, such as, in the U.S., the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (collectively, the “BSA”), and the BSA implementing regulations of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”), a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. A variety of similar anti-money laundering requirements apply in other countries.

Privacy and Information Security Regulations

The processing and transfer of personal information is required to provide certain of our services. Data privacy laws and regulations in the U.S. and foreign countries apply to the access, collection, transfer, use, storage, and destruction of personal information. In the U.S., our financial institution clients are required to comply with privacy regulations imposed under the GLBA, in addition to other regulations. As a processor of personal information in our role as a provider of services to financial institutions, we must comply with the FTC’s Safeguards Rule implementing certain provisions of GLBA with respect to maintenance of information security safeguards.


We perform services for healthcare companies and are, therefore, subject to compliance with laws and regulations regarding healthcare information, including in the U.S., the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996  (“HIPAA”). We also perform credit-related services and agree to comply with payment card standards, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. In addition, federal and state privacy and information security laws, and consumer protection laws, which apply to businesses that collect or process personal information, also apply to our businesses.

Privacy laws and regulations may require notification to affected individuals, federal and state regulators, and consumer reporting agencies in the event of a security breach that results in unauthorized access to, or disclosure of, certain personal information. Privacy laws outside the U.S. may be more restrictive and may require different compliance requirements than U.S. laws and regulations, and may impose additional duties on us in the performance of our services.

There has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information and data transfer, accompanied by legislation, regulations and enforcement activity intended to strengthen data protection, information security and consumer and personal privacy. We and certain of our affiliates are certified under the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework which provides a mechanism to comply with data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the European Union and Switzerland to the U.S. As a processor of personal information in our role as a provider of services to financial institutions, we are also subject to the jurisdiction of the FTC with respect to its enforcement of the Privacy Shield Framework.

The law in this area continues to develop and the changing nature of privacy laws in the U.S., the European Union and elsewhere could impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients. The European Union Parliament adopted the comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) that became effective in May 2018. T

he California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which became effective as of January 2020, creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers and places additional privacy and security obligations on entities handling certain personal data of consumers or households. We have been following the CCPA and its developments, including recent amendments, the release of proposed regulations, and the new CCPA ballot initiative scheduled for some time in the future. In our role as a service provider under CCPA, we help facilitate clients in their compliance obligations, in addition to confirming compliance by our own vendors.

We continually monitor the privacy and information security laws and regulations and w

hile we believe that we are compliant with our regulatory responsibilities, information security threats continue to evolve resulting in increased risk and exposure. In addition, legislation, regulation, litigation, court rulings, or other events could expose Broadridge to increased costs, liability, and possible damage to our reputation.

Legal Compliance

Regulations issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the U.S. Department of Treasury place prohibitions and restrictions on all U.S. citizens and entities, including the Company, with respect to transactions by U.S. persons with specified countries and individuals and entities identified on OFAC's sanctions lists and Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (for example, individuals and companies owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, countries subject to certain economic and trade sanctions, as well as terrorists, terrorist organizations and narcotics traffickers identified by OFAC under programs that are not country specific). Similar requirements apply to transactions and dealings with persons and entities specified in lists maintained in other countries. We have developed procedures and controls that are designed to monitor and address legal and regulatory requirements and developments to protect against having direct business dealings with such prohibited countries, individuals or entities.

Compliance with laws and regulations that are applicable to our international operations is complex and may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions. Our international operations could expose us to fines and penalties if we fail to comply with these regulations. These laws and regulations include import and export requirements, trade restrictions and embargoes, data privacy requirements, labor laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and local laws prohibiting bribery and other improper payments or inducements, such as the U.K. Bribery Act. Although we have implemented policies, procedures and training designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, vendors and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable laws and regulations, particularly as we expand our operations, including through acquisitions of businesses that were not previously subject to and may not have familiarity with laws and regulations applicable to us or compliance policies similar to ours. Any violations of sanctions or export control regulations or other laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, including the imposition of substantial fines and interest or prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries, and could also damage our reputation, our international expansion efforts and our business, and negatively impact our operating results.


Seasonality

Processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors comprises a large portion of our Investor Communication Solutions business. We process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our third and fourth fiscal quarters. The recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies. Historically, this has caused our revenues, operating income, net earnings, and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other quarter. Beginning on July 1, 2018, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” and its related amendments (collectively “ASU No. 2014-09”), resulting in the majority of our revenues from equity proxy services being recognized in the third and fourth fiscal quarters. Notwithstanding the impact of ASU No. 2014-09, the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows on a fiscal quarter-by-quarter basis.

Employees

At June 30, 2020, we had over 12,000 employees. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements governing their employment with our company. We believe that our employee relations are good.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors

You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated by reference herein. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the following information identifies the most significant factors affecting our company. However, additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.

If any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

The current Covid-19 pandemic may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial performance.

The current Covid-19 pandemic is having a significant effect on the world economy, which has created significant uncertainties. These uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the adverse effects of the pandemic on the economy, our employees, our clients and our third-party service providers and the general impact of recession in the U.S. The Covid-19 pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty and business and economic disruption.

Any of the following factors, or other cascading effects of the Covid-19 pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could negatively affect our operations and performance of our services, increase our costs, and negatively impact our sales, results of operations and our liquidity position, possibly to a significant degree:

•

The Covid-19 pandemic and the stay-at-home orders and quarantine rules resulting from the pandemic have had an impact on our ability to perform our services and the operations of our facilities. Our ability to provide our services and solutions could continue to be negatively impacted, including as a result of our employees or our clients’ and vendors’ employees working remotely, or due to business slowdown or interruption caused by the illness of our employees or the safety measures implemented to prevent the illness of our employees such as the potential closures of offices and facilities. In addition, a resurgence of the Covid-19 virus in the areas where we operate could result in additional stay-at-home orders being put in place. Our inability or failure to properly perform our services could cause us to incur expenses including service penalties, lose revenues, lose clients or damage our reputation.

•

We have taken several measures in response to Covid-19, including adopting strict social distancing and cleaning measures in our production facilities, taking the temperature of production-related employees in affected areas, and instituting remote work for many of our employees. We may take further actions in our facilities as may be required by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, clients, and vendors. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by Covid-19 or will be satisfactory to government authorities.


•

We are a global company and our business is highly dependent on the financial services industry and exchanges and market centers, particularly in North America. The current pandemic continues to adversely impact global commercial activity in many countries, including the U.S., and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets. An extended period of market disruption or closures, or a prolonged economic downturn (including whether there is a resurgence or second wave of infections) could negatively impact our business and financial results. We have experienced a decrease in demand for certain of our services and a delay or reduction in our sales which could continue if the economic downturn is prolonged or it causes financial stress for our clients. We could also experience a delay in onboarding our clients. Further, the decline in market activity has resulted in decreased assets under administration negatively impacting our mutual fund processing business. In addition, lower interest rates have negatively impacted our mutual fund processing and transfer agency businesses.

The technological resources and infrastructure used by us, as well as the third-party service providers and vendors who support us, such as internet capacity may be strained due to the increase in the number of remote users. In addition, we may face increased cybersecurity risks due to the number of employees who are working remotely in regions impacted by stay-at-home orders or observing quarantine safety measures. Increased levels of remote access may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to attempt to exploit vulnerabilities, and employees may be more susceptible to phishing and social engineering attempts due to increased stress caused by the crisis and from balancing family and work responsibilities at home.

•

We rely on third-party service providers and vendors to provide critical systems and services such as data center services and materials needed for the production and delivery of our print services, and the Covid-19 pandemic could present heightened or novel risks with respect to the continuity of our critical vendors’ services or ability to supply materials including the possibility of closure or business interruption.

•

There is a potential risk that members of our senior management team and/or our board of directors could become incapacitated or otherwise unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time due to illness resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic.

There are no comparable recent events which may provide guidance as to the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic, and, as a result, its ultimate impact is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business, our operations or the global economy and the full impact will depend on numerous evolving factors that are outside our control. However, the effects could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial performance.

Consolidation in the financial services industry could adversely affect our revenues by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and could make us increasingly dependent on a more limited number of clients.

Mergers or consolidations of financial institutions could reduce the number of our clients and potential clients. If our clients merge with or are acquired by other firms that are not our clients, or firms that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce the use of our services. In addition, it is possible that the larger financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations could decide to perform in-house some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

A large percentage of our revenues are derived from a small number of clients in the financial services industry.

In fiscal year 2020, we derived approximately


% of our consolidated revenues from our five largest clients and approximately

52%

of the revenues of our Global Technology and Operations segment from the 15 largest clients in that segment. Our largest single client accounted for approximately

6%

of our consolidated revenues in fiscal year 2020. While these clients generally work with multiple business segments, the loss of business from any of these clients due to merger or consolidation, financial difficulties or bankruptcy, or the termination or non-renewal of contracts could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. Also, in the event a client experiences financial difficulties or bankruptcy resulting in a reduction in their demand for our services or loss of the client’s business, in addition to losing the revenue from that client, we would be required to write-off any investments made by us in connection with that client, including costs incurred to set up or convert a client’s systems to function with our technology. Such costs for all clients represented approximately

9%

of our total assets as of June 30, 2020.


Security breaches or cybersecurity attacks could adversely affect our ability to operate, could result in personal, confidential or proprietary information being misappropriated, and may cause us to be held liable or suffer harm to our reputation.

We process and transfer sensitive data, including personal information, valuable intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential data provided to us by our clients, which include financial institutions, public companies, mutual funds, and healthcare companies. We also handle personal information of our employees in connection with their employment. We maintain systems and procedures including encryption, authentication technology, data loss prevention technology, entitlement management, access control and anti-malware software, and transmission of data over private networks to protect against unauthorized access to physical and electronic information, including by cyber-attacks.

In certain circumstances, our third-party vendors may have access to sensitive data including personal information. It is also possible that a third-party vendor could intentionally or inadvertently disclose sensitive data including personal information. We require our third-party vendors to have appropriate security controls if they have access to the personal information of our clients’ customers. However, despite those safeguards, it is possible that unauthorized individuals could improperly access our systems or those of our vendors, or improperly obtain or disclose the sensitive data including personal information that we or our vendors process or handle.

Many of our services are provided through the Internet which increases our exposure to potential cybersecurity attacks. We have experienced cybersecurity threats to our information technology infrastructure and have experienced non-material cyber-attacks, attempts to breach our systems and other similar incidents. Future threats could cause harm to our business and our reputation and challenge our ability to provide reliable service, as well as negatively impact our results of operations materially. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cybersecurity attacks or disruptions resulting from such events.

Any security breach resulting in the unauthorized use or disclosure of certain personal information could put individuals at risk of identity theft and financial or other harm and result in costs to us in investigation, remediation, legal defense and in liability to parties who are financially harmed. We may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of information security breaches or to respond to or alleviate problems caused by such breaches. For example, laws may require notification to regulators, clients or employees and enlisting credit monitoring or identity theft protection in the event of a privacy breach. A cybersecurity attack could also be directed at our systems and result in interruptions in our operations or delivery of services to our clients and their customers. Furthermore, a material security breach could cause us to lose revenues, lose clients or cause damage to our reputation.

Our clients are subject to complex laws and regulations, and new laws or regulations and/or changes to existing laws or regulations could impact our clients and, in turn, adversely impact our business or may reduce our profitability.

We provide technology solutions to financial services firms that are generally subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions. As a provider of services to financial institutions and issuers of securities, our services are provided in a manner designed to assist our clients in complying with the laws and regulations to which they are subject. Therefore, our services, such as our proxy and shareholder report distribution and processing and customer communications services, are particularly sensitive to changes in laws and regulations governing the financial services industry and the securities markets.

Our services and the fees we charge our clients for certain services are subject to change if applicable SEC or stock exchange rules or regulations are amended, or new laws or regulations are adopted, which could result in a negative impact on our business and financial results.

In addition, new regulations governing our clients could result in significant expenditures that could cause them to reduce their use of our services, seek to renegotiate existing agreements, or cease or curtail their operations, all of which could adversely impact our business. Further, an adverse regulatory action that changes a client’s business or adversely affects its financial condition, could decrease their ability to purchase, or their demand for, our products and services. The loss of business from our larger clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.

Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we do not comply with legal and regulatory requirements that apply to our services or businesses, and new laws or regulations and/or changes to existing laws or regulations to which we are subject may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or may reduce our profitability.

The legislative and regulatory environment of the financial services industry is continuously changing. The SEC, FINRA, DOL and various stock exchanges, and other U.S. and foreign governmental or regulatory authorities continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws and regulations. These legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect the way in which we conduct our business and may make our business less


profitable. Also, changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by those entities may adversely affect our business. Further, as a provider of technology services to financial institutions, certain aspects of our U.S. operations are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the FFIEC. A sufficiently unfavorable review from the FFIEC could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our business process outsourcing, mutual fund processing and transfer agency solutions as well as the entities providing those services are subject to regulatory oversight. Our provision of these services must comply with applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, FINRA, DOL and various stock exchanges, and other regulatory bodies charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities markets and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors participating in these markets. If we fail to comply with any applicable regulations in performing those services, we could lose our clients, be subject to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings, censures and fines, our reputation could be harmed, and we could be limited in our ability to obtain new clients.

In addition,

in connection with the offering of CITs, Matrix Trust acts as a discretionary trustee and ERISA fiduciary.  ERISA and the applicable provisions of the federal tax laws impose a number of duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA. As a result, we may face the risk of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings resulting from a breach of Matrix Trust’s fiduciary responsibilities.

For a description of the aspects of our business that are subject to regulatory compliance or oversight, please refer to Part I, “Item 1. Business - Regulation” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion.

As a provider of data and business processing solutions, our systems contain a significant amount of sensitive data, including personal information, related to our clients, customers of our clients, and our employees. We are, therefore, subject to compliance obligations under federal, state and foreign privacy and information security laws, including in the U.S., the GLBA, HIPAA, the CCPA, and the GDPR in the EU, and we are subject to penalties for failure to comply with such regulations. Such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. There has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information, accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection, information security and consumer and personal privacy. The law in these areas continues to develop, the number of jurisdictions adopting such laws continues to increase and these laws may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Furthermore, the changing nature of privacy laws in the U.S., the European Union and elsewhere could impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients. While we believe that Broadridge is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities, information security threats continue to evolve resulting in increased risk and exposure and increased costs to protect against the threat of information security breaches or to respond to or alleviate problems caused by such breaches.

For a description of privacy and information security regulations affecting us, please refer to Part I, “Item 1. Business - Regulations - Privacy and Information Security Regulations” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion.

Our ability to comply with regulations depends largely upon the maintenance of an effective compliance system which can be time consuming and costly, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel.

Our revenues may decrease due to declines in the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets.

We generate significant revenues from the transaction processing fees we earn from our services. These revenue sources are substantially dependent on the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets. The number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients and our clients’ customer trading volumes reflect the levels of participation and activity in the markets, which are impacted by market prices, and the liquidity of the securities markets, among other factors. Volatility in the securities markets and sudden sharp or gradual but sustained declines in market participation and activity can result in reduced investor communications activity, including reduced proxy and event-driven communications processing such as mutual fund proxy, mergers and acquisitions and other special corporate event communications processing, and reduced trading volumes. In addition, our event-driven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process. Event-driven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements, resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of event-driven fee revenues. As such, the timing and level of event-driven activity and its potential impact on our revenues and earnings are difficult to forecast. The occurrence of any of these events would likely result in reduced revenues and decreased profitability from our business operations.


We may be adversely impacted by a failure of third-party service providers to perform their functions.

We rely on relationships with third parties, including our service providers and other vendors for certain functions. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships and the agreements under which our third-party vendors operate, our financial results or reputation could suffer. We rely on these third parties, including our data center and cloud services providers, to provide services in a timely and accurate manner and to adequately address their own cybersecurity risks. Failure by these third parties to adequately perform their services as expected could result in material interruptions in our operations, and negatively impact our services resulting in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.

Certain of our businesses rely on a single or a limited number of service providers or vendors. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these service providers or vendors could impact their provision of services to us or they may no longer be able to provide services to us at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In such circumstances, we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace our key third-party vendors in a timely manner or on terms commercially reasonable to us given, among other reasons, the scope of responsibilities undertaken by some of our providers, the depth of their experience and their familiarity with our operations generally.

If we change a significant vendor, an existing provider makes significant changes to the way it conducts its operations, or is acquired, or we seek to bring in-house certain services performed today by third parties, we may experience unexpected disruptions in the provision of our solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.

Furthermore, certain third-party services providers or vendors may have access to sensitive data including personal information, valuable intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential data provided to us by our clients. It is possible that a third-party vendor could intentionally or inadvertently disclose sensitive data including personal information, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results and damage our reputation.

We rely on the United States Postal Service (“USPS”) and other third-party carriers to deliver communications and changes in our relationships with these carriers or an increase in postal rates or shipping costs may adversely impact demand for our products and services and could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

We rely upon the USPS and third-party carriers, including the United Parcel Service, for timely delivery of communications on behalf of our clients. As a result, we are subject to carrier disruptions due to factors that are beyond our control, including employee strikes, inclement weather, increased fuel costs and suspension of delivery of communications to certain countries as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Any failure to deliver communications to or on behalf of our clients in a timely and accurate manner may damage our reputation and brand and could cause us to lose clients. In addition, the USPS has incurred significant financial losses in recent years and may, as a result, implement significant changes to the breadth or frequency of its mail delivery causing disruptions in the service. If our relationship with any of these third-party carriers is terminated or impaired, or if any of these third parties are unable to distribute communications, we would be required to use alternative, and possibly more expensive, carriers to complete our distributions on behalf of our clients. We may be unable to engage alternative carriers on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, if at all, which could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, future increases in postal rates or shipping costs, as well as changes in customer preferences, may result in decreased demand for our traditional printed and mailed communications resulting in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In the event of a disaster, our disaster recovery and business continuity plans may fail, which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations.

Our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe, natural disaster, or severe weather including events resulting from unauthorized security breach, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. We have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events and we test our plans regularly. In addition, our data center services provider also has disaster recovery plans and procedures in place. However, we cannot be certain that our plans, or those of our data center services provider, will be successful in the event of a disaster. If our disaster recovery or business continuity plans are unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario, we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients, and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures. In addition, such failures could cause us to lose revenues, lose clients or damage our reputation.


Any slowdown or failure of our computer or communications systems could impact our ability to provide services to our clients and support our internal operations and could subject us to liability for losses suffered by our clients or their customers.

Our services depend on our ability to store, retrieve, process, and manage significant databases, and to receive and process transactions and investor communications through a variety of electronic systems. Our systems, those of our data center and cloud services providers, or any other systems with which our systems interact could slow down significantly or fail for a variety of reasons, including:

•

computer viruses or undetected errors in internal software programs or computer systems;

•

direct or indirect hacking or denial of service cybersecurity attacks;

•

inability to rapidly monitor all system activity;

•

inability to effectively resolve any errors in internal software programs or computer systems once they are detected;

•

heavy stress placed on systems during peak times or due to high volumes or volatility; or

•

power or telecommunications failure, fire, flood, pandemic or any other disaster.

While we monitor system loads and performance and implement system upgrades to handle predicted increases in trading volume and volatility, we may not be able to predict future volume increases or volatility accurately or that our systems and those of our data center services and cloud services providers will be able to accommodate these volume increases or volatility without failure or degradation. In addition, we may not be able to prevent cybersecurity attacks on our systems. Moreover, because we have outsourced our data center operations and use third-party cloud services for storage of certain data, the operation, performance and security functions of the data center and the cloud system involve factors beyond our control. Any significant degradation or failure of our computer systems, communications systems or any other systems in the performance of our services could cause our clients or their customers to suffer delays in their receipt of our services. These delays could cause substantial losses for our clients or their customers, and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures. In addition, such failures could cause us to lose revenues, lose clients or damage our reputation.

The inability to properly perform our services or operational errors in the performance of our services could lead to liability for claims, client loss and result in reputational damage.

The inability or the failure to properly perform our services could result in our clients and/or certain of our subsidiaries that operate regulated businesses being subjected to losses including censures, fines, or other sanctions by applicable regulatory authorities, and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those errors. In addition, the inability to properly perform our services or errors in the performance of our services could cause us to incur expenses including service penalties, lose revenues, lose clients or damage our reputation.

General economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that are beyond our control may contribute to reduced levels of activity in the securities markets, which could result in lower revenues from our business operations.

Our services are impacted by the number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients, the level of investor communications activity we process on behalf of our clients, trading volumes, market prices, and liquidity of the securities markets. These factors are in turn affected by general national and international economic and political conditions, and broad trends in business and finance that result in changes in participation and activity in the securities markets. For example, the Covid-19 pandemic continues to adversely impact global commercial activity and has contributed to a general economic recession, adversely impacting our clients and the markets. These factors include:

•

economic, political and market conditions;

•

legislative and regulatory changes;

•

the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital;

•

the level and volatility of interest rates;

•

currency values and inflation;

•

financial well-being of our clients; and

•

national, state, and local taxation levels affecting securities transactions.

These factors are beyond our control and may contribute to reduced levels of participation and activity in the securities markets. Our revenues have historically been largely driven by transaction processing based on levels of participation and activity in the securities markets. Accordingly, any significant reduction in participation and activity in the securities markets would likely result in lower revenues from our business operations.


If the operational systems and infrastructure that we depend on fail to keep pace with our growth, we may experience operating inefficiencies, client dissatisfaction and lost revenue opportunities.

The growth of our business and expansion of our client base may place a strain on our management and operations. We believe that our current and anticipated future growth will require the implementation of new and enhanced communications and information systems, the training of personnel to operate these systems, and the expansion and upgrade of core technologies. While many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional growth without redesign or replacement, we may nevertheless need to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate growth. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to predict the timing or rate of this growth accurately or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure on a timely basis.

Our growth has required and will continue to require increased investments in management personnel and systems, financial systems and controls, and office facilities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to manage or continue to manage our future growth successfully. If we fail to manage our growth, we may experience operating inefficiencies, dissatisfaction among our client base, and lost revenue opportunities.

If we are unable to respond to the demands of our existing and new clients, or adapt to technological changes or advances, our business and future growth could be impacted.

The global financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex and integrated infrastructures and products, new and changing business models and rapid technological and regulatory changes. Our clients’ needs and demands for our products and services evolve with these changes. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to respond to our clients’ demands for new services, capabilities and technologies on a timely and cost-effective basis. We also need to adapt to technological advancements such as digital and distributed ledger or blockchain technologies and cloud computing and keep pace with changing regulatory standards to address our clients’ increasingly sophisticated requirements. Transitioning to these new technologies may be disruptive to our resources and the services we provide and may increase our reliance on third-party service providers such as our cloud services provider.

In addition, we run the risk of disintermediation due to emerging technologies, including distributed ledger or blockchain technologies. If we fail to adapt or keep pace with new technologies in a timely manner, it could harm our ability to compete, decrease the value of our products and services to our clients, and harm our business and impact our future growth.

Intense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability.

The markets for our products and services continue to evolve and are highly competitive. We compete with a number of firms that provide similar products and services. In addition, our securities processing solutions compete with our clients’ in-house capabilities to perform competitive functions. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities, technologies, and client requirements and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities, offer more attractive terms to clients and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we will be able to offer or adopt. In addition, we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies, including international providers of similar products and services to ours. There can be no assurances that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors. If we fail to compete effectively, our market share could decrease and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially harmed.

Our business, financial position, and results of operations could be harmed by adverse rating actions by credit rating agencies.

If the credit ratings of our outstanding indebtedness are downgraded, or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur, our business, financial position, and results of operations could be adversely affected and perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged. A downgrade would have the effect of increasing our borrowing costs and could decrease the availability of funds we are able to borrow, adversely affecting our business, financial position, and results of operations. In addition, a downgrade could adversely affect our relationships with our clients. For further information with respect to our borrowing costs, see Note 13, “Borrowings” to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.


We may be unable to attract and retain key personnel.

Our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel such as our senior management and other qualified personnel including highly skilled technical employees to conduct our business. Skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where we compete are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required key personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our recruiting and retention costs increase significantly, our operations and financial results could be materially adversely affected.

The inability to identify, obtain and retain important intellectual property rights to technology could harm our business.

Our success depends in part upon the development, licensing, and acquisition of systems and applications to conduct our business. Our success will increasingly depend in part on our ability to identify, obtain and retain intellectual property rights to technology, both for internal use as well as for use in providing services to our clients, through internal development, acquisition, licensing from others, or alliances with others. Our inability to identify, obtain and retain rights to certain technology on favorable terms and conditions would make it difficult to conduct business, or to timely introduce new and innovative products and services, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our products and services, and the products and services provided to us by third parties, may infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties, and any infringement claims could require us to incur substantial costs, distract our management, or prevent us from conducting our business.

Although we attempt to avoid infringing upon known proprietary rights of third parties, we are subject to the risk of claims alleging infringement of third-party proprietary rights. If in response to a third-party infringement allegation, we were to determine that we require a license to such third-party’s proprietary rights, then we may be unable to obtain such license on commercially reasonable terms. Additionally, third parties that provide us with products or services that are integral to the conduct of our business may also be subject to similar infringement allegations from others, which could prevent such third parties from continuing to provide these products or services to us. In either of these events, we may need to undertake substantial reengineering of our products or services in order to continue offering them, and we may not succeed in doing so. In addition, any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending such claim, even if the claim is baseless, and could distract our management from our business. Furthermore, a party asserting such an infringement claim could secure a judgment against us that requires us to pay substantial damages, grants such party injunctive relief, or grants other court ordered remedies that could prevent us from conducting our business.

Acquisitions and integrating such acquisitions create certain risks and may affect operating results.

As part of our overall business strategy, we may make acquisitions and strategic investments in companies, technologies or products, or enter joint ventures. These transactions and the integration of acquisitions involve a number of risks. The core risks are in the areas of:

•

valuation: finding suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms; competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirors, and negotiating a fair price for the business based on inherently limited due diligence reviews;

•

integration: managing the complex process of integrating the acquired company’s people, products, technology, and other assets, and converting their financial, information security, privacy and other systems and controls to meet our standards, so as to realize the projected value of the acquired company and the synergies projected to be realized in connection with the acquisition; and

•

legacy issues: protecting against actions, claims, regulatory investigations, losses, and other liabilities related to the predecessor business.

Also, the process of integrating these businesses may disrupt our business and divert our resources. These risks may arise for a number of reasons including, for example:

•

finding suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms;

•

competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirors;

•

incurring unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with such acquisitions;

•

devoting unanticipated financial and management resources to an acquired business;

•

borrowing money from lenders or selling equity or debt securities to the public to finance future acquisitions on terms  that may be adverse to us;

•

loss of clients of the acquired business;


•

entering markets where we have minimal prior experience; and

•

experiencing decreases in earnings as a result of non-cash impairment charges.

In addition, international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including, for example:

•

geographically separated organizations, systems, and facilities;

•

integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures;

•

complying with non-U.S. regulatory requirements;

•

enforcing intellectual property rights in some non-U.S. countries; and

•

general economic and political conditions.

We may incur non-cash goodwill impairment charges in the future.

As a result of past acquisitions, we carry a significant goodwill balance on our balance sheet. Goodwill accounted for

approximately 34%

of the total assets on our balance sheet as of June 30, 2020. We expect to engage in additional acquisitions, which will likely result in our recognition of additional goodwill. We test goodwill for impairment annually as of March 31st and at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable. Although no indications of a goodwill impairment have been identified, there can be no assurance that we will not incur impairment charges in the future, particularly in the event of a prolonged economic recession. A significant non-cash goodwill impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

We operate internationally and our operations could be adversely impacted by local legal, economic, political and other conditions.

A portion of our revenue is generated outside the U.S. and in recent years, we have expanded our operations, entered strategic alliances, and acquired businesses outside the U.S. Also, our business is highly dependent on the global financial services industry and exchanges and market centers around the world. Compliance with foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that are applicable to our international operations could cause us to incur higher than anticipated costs, and inadequate enforcement of laws or policies such as those protecting intellectual property, could affect our business and the Company’s overall results of operations. Our operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries, particularly in those with developing economies, and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation and currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and non-U.S. currencies.

For example, the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (“Brexit”) became effective on January 31, 2020.  A transition period will apply until the end of 2020 (or later, if extended) during which the pre-Brexit legal regime will continue to apply while the United Kingdom and European Union negotiate rules that will apply to their future relationship. It is unknown how that future relationship will be structured which is likely to lead to differing laws and regulations in the United Kingdom and European Union and further global economic, trade and regulatory uncertainty. This continued uncertainty surrounding the withdrawal, has caused, and may continue to cause, economic uncertainty including volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations, resulting in a decline in the value of the British pound relative to the U.S. dollar. Brexit may also negatively impact our clients with operations in the United Kingdom, which may cause them to reduce their spending on our solutions and services.

In addition, our operations and our ability to deliver our services to our clients could be adversely impacted if there is instability, disruption or destruction in certain geographic regions including as a result of natural or man-made disasters, wars, terrorist activities, or any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue.

Certain of our services may be exposed to risk from our counterparties and third parties.

Our mutual fund and exchange traded fund processing services and our transfer agency services involve the settlement of transactions on behalf of our clients and third parties. With these activities, we may be exposed to risk in the event our clients, or broker-dealers, banks, clearing organizations, or depositories are unable to fulfill contractual obligations. Failure to settle a transaction may affect our ability to conduct these services or may reduce their profitability as a result of the reputational risk associated with failure to settle.


Our revenues are subject to seasonal variations because we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports in our third and fourth fiscal quarters.

Processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors comprises a large portion of our Investor Communication Solutions business. We process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our third and fourth fiscal quarters. The recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies. This causes our revenues, operating income, net earnings, and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters. The seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows on a fiscal quarter-by-quarter basis.

ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

ITEM 2.  Properties

We operate our business primarily from 69 facilities.  We lease three facilities in Edgewood, New York, and facilities in El Dorado Hills, California; South Windsor, Connecticut; Kansas City, Missouri; Coppell, Texas; and Markham, Canada, with a combined space of 2.2 million square feet which are used in connection with our Investor Communication Solutions business. We also lease a facility in Newark, New Jersey, which houses our principal Global Technology and Operations business operations. We also lease space at 60 additional locations, subject to customary lease arrangements. Our leases expire on a staggered basis. We believe our facilities are currently adequate for their intended purposes and are adequately maintained.

ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings

In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to claims and litigation. While the outcome of any claim or litigation is inherently unpredictable, the Company believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

ITEM 4. Mine Safety Disclosures

Not applicable.


PART II.

ITEM 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Our common stock began trading “regular way” on the NYSE under the symbol “BR” on April 2, 2007. There were 10,172 stockholders of record of the Company’s common stock as of July 31, 2020. This figure excludes the beneficial holders whose shares may be held of record by brokerage firms and clearing agencies.

Dividend Policy

We expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock. On August 10, 2020, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend by $0.035 per share to $0.575 per share, an increase in our expected annual dividend amount from $2.16 to $2.30 per share. The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our businesses, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant.

As a holding company, substantially all our assets being comprised of the capital stock of our subsidiaries, our ability to pay dividends will be dependent on our receiving dividends from our operating subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries through which we provide our business process outsourcing and mutual fund processing services, are regulated and may be subject to restrictions on their ability to pay dividends to us. We do not believe that these restrictions are significant enough to impact the Company’s ability to pay dividends.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP in the U.S. and in accordance with the SEC requirements for Annual Reports on Form 10-K. These financial statements present the consolidated position of the Company and include the entities in which the Company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest as well as various entities in which the Company has investments recorded under the equity method of accounting as well as certain marketable and non-marketable securities. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Amounts presented may not sum due to rounding. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation where applicable, except as it relates to (i) ASU No. 2016-02, as amended “Leases” (“ASU No. 2016-02”), (ii) ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASU No. 2014-09”), (iii) ASU No. 2016-01, “Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“ASU No. 2016-01”), and (iv) ASU No. 2018-02, “Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income” (“ASU No. 2018-02”), as described further below.


In presenting the Consolidated Financial Statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures. Management continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. The estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment, available information, and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. However, actual amounts and results could differ from those estimates made by management. In management’s opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported. The results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods.

Effective July 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases” and its related amendments (collectively referred to as “ASU 2016-02, as amended”) by recognizing a ROU asset and corresponding lease liability, along with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings, in the period of adoption. Under this method of adoption, the Company has not restated the prior period Consolidated Financial Statements presented to the current period presentation. Additional information about the impact of the Company's adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, as amended is included in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 8, “Leases” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Effective July 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09 using the modified retrospective transition approach applied to all contracts. Under this transition approach, we have not restated the prior period Consolidated Financial Statements presented to the current period presentation. Additional information about the Company’s revenue recognition policies and the related impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 is included in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 3, “Revenue Recognition”.

Effective July 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2016-01, which requires changes in the fair value of publicly traded equity securities for which we do not have significant influence to be recorded as part of Net earnings rather than as Other comprehensive income (loss), net. In addition, equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value will be recorded at cost less impairment as further adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the issuer. We adopted ASU No. 2016-01 using the modified-retrospective transition approach by recording the cumulative effect of previously unrecognized gains or losses on publicly traded equity securities to retained earnings as of July 1, 2018. The provisions of ASU No. 2016-01 relative to equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value have been applied prospectively. The Consolidated Financial Statements have not been revised for periods prior to July 1, 2018. The impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-01 resulted in a reclassification of less than $0.1 million in unrealized gains, net from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings as of July 1, 2018.

Effective July 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2018-02, which allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects associated with the change in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) enacted in December 2017. The adoption of ASU No. 2018-02 resulted in an increase to retained earnings of $1.5 million.

Effective July 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2017-07, “Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost” (“ASU No. 2017-07”) whereby we revised its presentation in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings to reflect the non-service cost components of net benefit cost as part of Other non-operating income (expenses), net, which were previously recorded as part of Total operating expenses. All prior period information has been conformed to the current period presentation.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. The estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment, available information, and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. However, actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.

Goodwill

.

We review the carrying value of all our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values. We are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment. When determining fair value of a reporting unit, we utilize the income approach which considers a discounted future cash flow analysis using various assumptions, including projections of revenues based on assumed long-term growth rates, estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular reporting unit’s weighted-average cost of capital. The principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows based on forecasted earnings before interest and taxes, and the selection of the terminal value growth rate and discount rate assumptions. The weighted-average cost of capital takes into account the relative weight of each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and long-term debt). Our estimates of long-term growth and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of external sources, and are developed as part of our routine, long-range planning process.


Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. We had $1,674.5 million of goodwill as of June 30, 2020. Given the significance of our goodwill, an adverse change to the fair value of one of our reporting units could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our earnings.

The Company performs a sensitivity analysis under Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test assuming hypothetical reductions in the fair values of our reporting units. A 10% change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows, discount rates, or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would not result in an impairment of our goodwill.

Income Taxes

.

The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). The Company is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the U.S. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $13.1 million as of June 30, 2020 of which $1.5 million are subject to expiration in the June 30, 2020 through June 30, 2028 period. The remaining $11.6 million of carryforwards has an indefinite utilization period. In addition, the Company has estimated U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $37.0 million of which $16.9 million can be utilized through June 30, 2030 with the balance of $20.2 million having an indefinite utilization period. U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards resulting from tax losses beginning with the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 have an indefinite carryforward under the Tax Act. The Company did not realize any federal net operating losses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020.

Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the Company will not be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to net operating and capital loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings. The Company has recorded valuation allowances of $6.7 million and $3.3 million at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be recognized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income, carryforward periods, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies. Projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned. The assumptions used to project future taxable income requires significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses.

On the same date that the Tax Act was enacted, December 22, 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) which provided the Company with up to one year to finalize accounting for the impacts of the Tax Act. Under SAB 118, the Company finalized the prior year estimate of the net tax impact to the Company arising from the enactment of the Tax Act, and recognized a tax benefit of approximately $0.5 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.

Share-based Payments

.

Accounting for stock-based compensation requires the measurement of stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. We determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option-pricing model. The binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of our stock price and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk-free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. Determining these assumptions are subjective and complex, and therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options. A hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2020 stock option grants would result in approximately a $2.4 million change in total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2020 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. A hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2020 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.8 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2020 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. A hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2020 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.1 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2020 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. A hypothetical one-half percentage point change in the dividend yield


assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2020 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.9 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2020 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

Management focuses on a variety of key indicators to plan, measure and evaluate the Company’s business and financial performance. These performance indicators include Revenue and Recurring fee revenue as well as not generally accepted accounting principles measures (“Non-GAAP”) of Adjusted Operating income, Adjusted Net earnings, Adjusted Diluted earnings per share, Free Cash flow, and Closed sales. In addition, management focuses on select operating metrics specific to Broadridge of Record Growth and Internal Trade Growth, as defined below.

Refer to the section “Explanation and Reconciliation of the Company’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of Adjusted Operating income, Adjusted Net earnings, Adjusted Diluted earnings per share, and Free Cash flow to the most directly comparable generally accepted accounting principles  (“GAAP”) measures, and an explanation for why these Non-GAAP metrics provide useful information to investors and how management uses these Non-GAAP metrics for operational and financial decision-making. Refer to the section “Results of Operations” for a description of Closed sales and an explanation of why Closed sales is a useful performance metric for management and investors.

Revenues

Revenues are primarily generated from fees for processing and distributing investor communications and fees for technology-enabled services and solutions. The Company monitors revenue in each of our two reportable segments as a key measure of success in addressing our clients’ needs. Fee revenues are derived from both recurring and event-driven activity. The level of recurring and event-driven activity the Company processes directly impacts distribution revenues. While event-driven activity is highly repeatable, it may not recur on an annual basis. Event-driven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions the Company processes. Event-driven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements, resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of event-driven fee revenues. Distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials, interim communications, transaction reporting, customer communications and fulfillment services as well as Matrix administrative services.

Recurring fee revenue growth represents the Company’s total annual fee revenue growth, less growth from event-driven fee revenues. We distinguish recurring fee revenue growth between organic and acquired:

•

Organic – We define organic revenue as the recurring fee revenue generated from Net New Business and internal growth.

•

Acquired – We define acquired revenue as the recurring fee revenue generated from acquired services in the first twelve months following the date of acquisition. This type of growth comes as a result of our strategy to purchase, integrate, and leverage the value of assets we acquire.

Revenues and Recurring fee revenue are useful metrics for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates the Company’s ongoing operational performance. See “Results of Operations” as well as Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 3, “Revenue Recognition” to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Record Growth and Internal Trade Growth

The Company uses select operating metrics specific to Broadridge of Record Growth and Internal Trade Growth in evaluating its business results and identifying trends affecting its business. Record Growth is defined as stock record growth and interim record growth which measure the estimated annual change in total positions eligible for equity proxy materials and mutual fund and exchange traded fund interim communications, respectively, for equities and mutual fund position data reported to Broadridge in both the current and prior year periods. Internal Trade Growth represents the estimated change in trade volumes for Broadridge securities processing clients whose contracts are linked to trade volumes and who were on Broadridge’s trading platforms in both the current and prior year periods. Record Growth and Internal Trade Growth are useful non-financial metrics for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates Broadridge’s ongoing operational performance within its Investor Communication Solutions and Global Technology and Operations reportable segments, respectively.


The key performance indicators for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, and 2019, are as follows:

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussions of Analysis of Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Analysis of Reportable Segments refer to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. The Analysis of Consolidated Statements of Earnings should be read in conjunction with the Analysis of Reportable Segments, which provides more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Discussions of Analysis of Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Analysis of Reportable Segments for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 is disclosed in Part II, “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of the 2019 Annual Report.

The following references are utilized in the discussions of Analysis of Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Analysis of Reportable Segments:

“Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property” and “Acquisition and Integration Costs” represent certain non-cash amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets and purchased intellectual property assets, as well as certain transaction and integration costs associated with the Company’s acquisition activities, respectively.

“IBM Private Cloud Charges” represent a charge on the hardware assets to be transferred to IBM and other charges related to the IBM Private Cloud Agreement.

“Gain on Sale of a Joint Venture Investment” represents a non-operating, cash gain on the sale of one of the Company’s joint venture investments.

“Covid-19 Related Expenses” represents certain non-recurring expenses associated with the Covid-19 pandemic.

“Net New Business” refers to recurring revenue from Closed sales less recurring revenue from client losses.

The following definitions describe the Company’s Revenues:

Fee revenues in the Investor Communication Solutions segment are derived from both recurring and event-driven activity. In addition, the level of recurring and event-driven activity we process directly impacts distribution revenues. While event-driven activity is highly repeatable, it may not recur on an annual basis. The types of services we provide that comprise event-driven activity are:

•

Mutual Fund Proxy: The proxy and related services we provide to mutual funds when certain events occur requiring a shareholder vote including changes in directors, sub-advisors, fee structures, investment restrictions, and mergers of funds.


•

Mutual Fund Communications: Mutual fund communications services consist primarily of the distribution on behalf of mutual funds of supplemental information required to be provided to the annual mutual fund prospectus as a result of certain triggering events such as a change in portfolio managers. In addition, mutual fund communications consist of notices and marketing materials such as newsletters.

•

Proxy Contests and Specials, Corporate Actions, and Other: The proxy services we provide in connection with shareholder meetings driven by special events such as proxy contests, mergers and acquisitions, and tender/exchange offers.

Event-driven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process. Event-driven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements, resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of event-driven fee revenues. As such, the timing and level of event-driven activity and its potential impact on revenues and earnings are difficult to forecast.

Generally, mutual fund proxy activity has been subject to a greater level of volatility than the other components of event-driven activity. During fiscal year 2020, mutual fund proxy fee revenues were 35% lower than the prior fiscal year while during fiscal year 2019 mutual fund proxy revenues were 14% lower than the prior fiscal year. Although it is difficult to forecast the levels of event-driven activity, we expect that the portion of fee revenues derived from mutual fund proxy activity may continue to experience volatility in the future.

Distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials, interim communications, transaction reporting, customer communications and fulfillment services as well as Matrix administrative services.

Distribution cost of revenues consists primarily of postage-related expenses incurred in connection with our Investor Communication Solutions segment, as well as Matrix administrative services expenses. These costs are reflected in Cost of revenues.

Closed sales represent an estimate of the expected annual recurring fee revenue for new client contracts that were signed by Broadridge in the current reporting period. Closed sales does not include event-driven or distribution activity. We consider contract terms, expected client volumes or activity, knowledge of the marketplace and experience with our clients, among other factors, when determining the estimate. Management uses Closed sales to measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs, as an indicator of expected future revenues and as a performance metric in determining incentive compensation.

Closed sales is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue or other income statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Closed sales is a useful metric for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates our ongoing operational performance.

The inherent variability of transaction volumes and activity levels can result in some variability of amounts reported as actual achieved Closed sales. Larger Closed sales can take up to 12 to 24 months or longer to convert to revenues, particularly for the services provided by our Global Technology and Operations segment. For fiscal years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, we are reporting Closed sales net of a 4.0% allowance adjustment. Consequently, our reported Closed sales amounts are not adjusted for actual revenues achieved because these adjustments are estimated in the period the sale is reported. We assess the allowance amount at the end of each fiscal year to establish the appropriate allowance for the subsequent year using trailing five years actual data as the starting point, normalized for outlying factors, if any, to enhance the accuracy of the allowance.

For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, Closed sales were $238.9 million and $233.3 million, respectively. The fiscal years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, are net of an allowance adjustment of $10.0 million and $9.7 million, respectively.

Recent Developments

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of Covid-19 as a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the world including the U.S., India, Canada, Europe and other locations where we operate. Developments have occurred rapidly with respect to the spread of Covid-19 and its impact on human health and businesses. To date, the Covid-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, created significant financial market volatility, disrupted global supply chains, and resulted in a significant number of deaths and infections worldwide. In response, several countries worldwide enacted fiscal stimulus packages while central banks increased monetary stimulus, both designed to help mitigate the negative macroeconomic effects of Covid-19. In addition, several national, state and local governments have placed restrictions on people from gathering in groups or interacting within a certain physical distance (i.e. social distancing) and in certain cases, have ordered businesses to close, limit operations or mandate that people stay at home.


The Company’s operations, both our Investor Communication Solutions and Global Technology and Operations segments, are critical components of the overall financial markets infrastructure in the U.S. and globally. As a result, we have been permitted to continue operating in all jurisdictions in which we conduct business (in most cases remotely), including in jurisdictions that have mandated the closure of certain businesses. Accordingly, the Company has taken several measures designed to protect the health of our employees and to minimize our operational disruption and resulting provision of services to our clients from the Covid-19 pandemic, including adopting strict social distancing and cleaning measures in our production facilities, taking the temperature of production-related employees in affected areas on a daily basis as a prerequisite to entering our facilities, load balancing of client jobs between various facilities, and instituting work from home protocols for employees not involved in production operations, amongst other measures.

To date, there has not been a material impact as a result of Covid-19 on our consolidated revenues and pre-tax income. The Company processed above average levels of equity and fixed income trades in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020 for our financial services clients, many of whom themselves have experienced higher levels of trading activity from market volatility caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, partially offset by lower internal growth in certain aspects of our Investor Communication Solutions business. In addition, all of our production-related facilities remain operational and are continuing to provide ongoing services to our clients. Further, we have not experienced any significant supply-chain issues as our critical vendors have also remained operational and continue to meet their on-going service level requirements. We continue to actively engage with our clients to assist with their service demands, including our clients’ needs for any supplemental operational services and/or changes to existing service requirements in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we are unable to precisely predict the impact that Covid-19 will have in the future due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the impact to the business of our clients, and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. Given these uncertainties, Covid-19 could disrupt the business of certain of our clients, decrease our clients’ demand for our services, impact our business operations and our ability to execute on our associated business strategies and initiatives, and adversely impact our consolidated results of operations and/or our financial condition in the future. We will continue to closely monitor and evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of Covid-19 to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition.

On August 5, 2020, the SEC proposed modifications to the mutual fund and exchange-traded fund disclosure framework (the “Fund Disclosure Proposal”).

The Fund Disclosure Proposal is intended to provide a disclosure framework that would better serve the needs of retail investors.

Among the modifications proposed are the requirement for streamlined shareholder reports with concise and visually engaging content which would replace prospectus updates, and improvements to prospectus disclosure.

Adoption and implementation of the Fund Disclosure Proposal amendments as proposed could have an impact on our services, business and financial results. We will closely monitor and evaluate the progress of the Fund Disclosure Proposal and its potential impact on our business. Please see our “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A. of this Form 10-K for more information.


ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS

Fiscal Year 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year 2019

The table below presents Consolidated Statements of Earnings data for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods:

NM - Not meaningful

Revenues

The table below presents Consolidated Statements of Earnings data for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods:


Revenues increased $166.9 million, or 4%, to $4,529.0 million from $4,362.2 million.

•

Recurring fee revenue growth was primarily driven by acquisitions that were not in the prior year period, as well as 4pts of Organic growth primarily from Net New Business. Internal growth was slightly positive with positive growth in our Global Technology and Operations segment driven by higher trading volumes resulting from market volatility, partially offset by negative internal growth in our Investor Communication Solutions segment.

•

Event-driven fee revenues decreased $66.5 million, or 27%, primarily due to decreased activity in mutual fund proxy, equity special meetings, and equity contests.

•

Distribution revenues decreased $8.6 million, or 1%, to $1,451.2 million primarily due to the decrease in Event-driven fee revenues.

•

Currencies negatively impacted revenues by $34.0 million due to a combination of foreign acquisitions, continued international revenue growth, and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies.

Total operating expenses.

Operating expenses increased $194.7 million, or 5%, to $3,904.1 million from $3,709.5 million as a result of:

•

Cost of revenues - The increase of $133.2 million in cost of revenues primarily reflected higher operating costs from acquisitions and related amortization expense and charges associated with the IBM Private Cloud Agreement, partially offset by certain lower operational expenses.

•

Selling, general and administrative expenses - The increase of $61.5 million in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected the impact of acquisitions and higher compensation expense.

•

Currencies positively impacted total operating expenses by $31.3 million due to a combination of foreign acquisitions, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, and continued international operating expense growth.

Operating income margin of 13.8% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 declined 120 bps from 15.0% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 partly due to charges associated with the IBM Private Cloud Agreement. However, Adjusted Operating income margin of 17.5% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 increased 40 bps on higher recurring revenues from 17.1% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, which excludes certain charges associated with the IBM Private Cloud Agreement and certain other Non-GAAP adjustments. See “Explanation and Reconciliation of the Company’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

Interest expense, net.

Interest expenses, net, was $58.8 million, an increase of $17.0 million from $41.8 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. The increase of $17.0 million was primarily due to an increase in interest expense from higher borrowings primarily related to acquisitions.

Other non-operating income (expenses), net.

Other non-operating income, net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 was $13.4 million, an increase of $17.1 million, compared to $3.7 million of Other non-operating expenses, net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. The increase of $17.1 million was primarily due to higher investment gains as compared to the prior year period.

Provision for income taxes

.

•

Effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 - 20.2%.

•

Effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 - 20.6%.

The decrease in the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 was primarily driven by higher discrete tax benefits, partially offset by lower excess tax benefits of $15.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 compared to $19.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.

ANALYSIS OF REPORTABLE SEGMENTS

Broadridge has two reportable business segments: (1) Investor Communication Solutions and (2) Global Technology and Operations.

The primary component of “Other” are certain gains, losses, corporate overhead expenses and non-operating expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, such as interest expense. Foreign currency exchange is a reconciling item between the actual foreign currency exchange rates and the constant foreign currency exchange rates used for internal management reporting.

Certain corporate expenses, as well as certain centrally managed expenses, are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner. Because the Company compensates the management of its various businesses on, among other factors, segment profit, the Company may elect to record certain segment-related operating and non-operating expense items in Other rather than reflect such items in segment profit.


In connection with an organizational change made in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, in order to further align and enhance our portfolio of services, the results for the Company’s wealth management Advisor Solutions services that were previously reported in our Investor Communication Solutions reportable segment are now reported within the Global Technology and Operations reportable segment. As a result, our prior period segment results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 have been revised to reflect this change, which resulted in transferring $42.8 million of revenues and $2.2 million of earnings before income taxes between reportable segments, respectively.

Investor Communication Solutions

Fiscal Year 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year 2019

Revenues increased $23.0 million to $3,491.3 million from $3,468.3 million, and earnings before income taxes decreased $42.1 million to $464.1 million from $506.2 million as a result of:


For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020:

•

Recurring fees grew 6% driven by Organic growth and growth from acquisitions. Organic growth reflected continued growth from new sales.  Internal growth was down 1pt as 10% position growth in annual equity proxy communications and 2% for mutual fund and exchange traded funds interims was offset by lower customer communications volumes and lower revenue from other services.

•

Lower event-driven fee revenues were due to decreased activity in mutual fund proxy, equity special meetings, and equity contests.

•

Lower distribution revenues resulted from the decrease in event-driven fee revenues, which more than offset the impact of higher recurring fee revenues.

•

The earnings decrease of $42.1 million was due to lower event-driven activity more than offsetting the contribution from higher recurring fee revenues.

•

Pre-tax margins decreased by 1.3 percentage points to 13.3% from 14.6%.


Global Technology and Operations

Fiscal Year 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year 2019

Revenues increased $177.9 million to $1,174.2 million from $996.3 million, and earnings before income taxes increased $32.5 million to $245.0 million from $212.5 million as a result of:

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020:

•

Recurring fees grew 18% driven by growth from acquisitions, including software license sales, and Organic growth. Organic growth was driven by both Net New Business and Internal growth, as internal growth was driven by higher trading volumes resulting from market volatility.

•

The earnings increase was due to higher revenues from acquisitions and higher organic revenues, partially offset by the impact of expenditures to implement and support new business and the amortization of acquired intangibles.  Pre-tax margins decreased by 0.4 percentage points to 20.9% from 21.3%.

Other

Loss before income taxes was $146.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, an increase of $15.4 million, or 12%, compared to $130.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.

•

The increased loss before income taxes was primarily due to charges associated with the IBM Private Cloud Agreement and higher interest expense versus the prior year period, partially offset by lower compensation expense and gain on sale of investments.

Explanation and Reconciliation of the Company’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company’s results in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP except where otherwise noted. In certain circumstances, results have been presented in Non-GAAP measures. These Non-GAAP measures are Adjusted Operating income, Adjusted Operating income margin, Adjusted Net earnings, Adjusted earnings per share, and Free cash flow. These Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company’s reported results.

The Company believes our Non-GAAP financial measures help investors understand how management plans, measures and evaluates the Company’s business performance. Management believes that Non-GAAP measures provide consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors’ understanding of the Company’s operating results and trends by providing an additional basis for comparison. Management uses these Non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. In addition, and as a consequence of the importance of these Non-GAAP financial measures in managing our business, the Company’s Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors incorporates Non-GAAP financial measures in the evaluation process for determining management compensation.


Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Per Share

These Non-GAAP measures reflect Operating income, Operating income margin, Net earnings, and Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. These adjusted measures exclude the impact of: (i) Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property, (ii) Acquisition and Integration Costs, (iii) IBM Private Cloud Charges, (iv) the Gain on Sale of a Joint Venture Investment, and (v) Covid-19 Related Expenses. Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property represents non-cash amortization expenses associated with the Company's acquisition activities. Acquisition and Integration Costs represent certain transaction and integration costs associated with the Company’s acquisition activities. IBM Private Cloud Charges represent a charge on the hardware assets to be transferred to IBM and other charges related to the IBM Private Cloud Agreement. The Gain on Sale of a Joint Venture Investment represents a non-operating, cash gain on the sale of one of the Company’s joint venture investments. Covid-19 Related Expenses represents certain non-recurring expenses associated with the Covid-19 pandemic.

We exclude IBM Private Cloud Charges, Gain on Sale of a Joint Venture Investment, and Covid-19 Related Expenses from our Adjusted Operating income and other earnings measures because excluding such information provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business and these items do not reflect ordinary operations or earnings. We also exclude the impact of Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property, as these non-cash amounts are significantly impacted by the timing and size of individual acquisitions and do not factor into the Company's capital allocation decisions, management compensation metrics or multi-year objectives. Furthermore, management believes that this adjustment enables better comparison of our results as Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property will not recur in future periods once such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Although we exclude Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property from our adjusted earnings measures, our management believes that it is important for investors to understand that these intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets.

Free Cash Flows

In addition to the Non-GAAP financial measures discussed above, we provide Free cash flow information because we consider Free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated that could be used for dividends, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions, other investments, as well as debt servicing. Free cash flow is a Non-GAAP financial measure and is defined by the Company as Net cash flows provided by operating activities less Capital expenditures as well as Software purchases and capitalized internal use software.

Set forth below is a reconciliation of such Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures (unaudited):


(a) Calculated using the GAAP effective tax rate, adjusted to exclude $15.6 million of excess tax benefits (“ETB”) associated with stock-based compensation for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, and $19.3 million of ETB associated with stock-based compensation for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. For purposes of calculating the Adjusted earnings per share, the same adjustments were made on a per share basis.


FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash and cash equivalents consisted of the following:

At June 30, 2020 and 2019, Cash and cash equivalents were $476.6 million and $273.2 million, respectively. Total stockholders’ equity was $1,346.5 million and $1,127.5 million at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. At the current time, and in future periods, we expect cash generated by our operations, together with existing cash, cash equivalents, and borrowings from the capital markets, to be sufficient to cover cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, dividends and common stock repurchases. Given the volatility in the rapidly changing market and economic conditions related to the Covid-19 pandemic, we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our business and financial position.

We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we may be required to pay additional foreign taxes to repatriate these funds. However, while we may do so at a future date, the Company does not need to repatriate future foreign earnings to fund U.S. operations.


Outstanding borrowings and available capacity under the Company’s borrowing arrangements were as follows:

_________

(a) The Fiscal 2014 Senior Notes were reclassified from Long-term debt to Current portion of long-term debt in September 2019 to reflect the remaining maturity of less than a year.

The Company has a $1.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility (the “Fiscal 2019 Revolving Credit Facility”), which is comprised of a $1.1 billion U.S. dollar tranche and a $400.0 million multicurrency tranche. Borrowings under the Fiscal 2019 Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at LIBOR plus 101.5 basis points. In addition, the Fiscal 2019 Revolving Credit Facility has an annual facility fee equal to 11.0 basis points on the entire facility.

The Fiscal 2019 Revolving Credit Facility and senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are ranked equally in right of payment. Interest on the senior notes due 2020 is payable semiannually on March 1

Our liquidity position may be negatively affected by changes in general economic conditions, regulatory requirements and access to the capital markets, which may be limited if we were to fail to renew any of the credit facilities on their renewal dates or if we were to fail to meet certain ratios.

Please refer to Note 13, “Borrowings” to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion.


Cash Flows

Fiscal Year 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year 2019

The decrease in cash provided by operating activities of $18.7 million primarily reflects increased scaling of client-related platform implementation and development, partially offset by cash flows from higher revenues, cash collections and working capital.

The increase in cash used in investing activities of $8.1 million primarily reflects an increase in capital expenditures and software purchases, partially offset by lower acquisition spend in fiscal year 2020.

The increase in cash provided by financing activities of $224.3 million primarily reflects a decrease in the repurchase of common stock, partially offset by a decrease in net proceeds from borrowings and an increase in dividends paid.

Income Taxes

The Company, headquartered in the U.S., is routinely examined by the IRS and is also routinely examined by the tax authorities in the U.S. states and foreign countries in which it conducts business. The tax years under audit examination vary by tax jurisdiction. The Company regularly considers the likelihood of assessments in each of the jurisdictions resulting from examinations. To the extent the Company determines it has potential tax assessments in particular tax jurisdictions, the Company has established tax reserves which it believes are adequate in relation to the potential assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted when there is more information available, when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position has expired. The resolution of tax matters should not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Earnings for a particular future period.


Defined Benefit Pension Plans

The Company sponsors a Supplemental Officer Retirement Plan (the “SORP”). The SORP is a nonqualified ERISA defined benefit plan pursuant to which the Company will pay supplemental pension benefits to certain key officers upon retirement based upon the officers’ years of service and compensation. The SORP was closed to new participants beginning in fiscal year 2015. The Company also sponsors a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the “SERP”). The SERP is also a nonqualified ERISA defined benefit plan pursuant to which the Company will pay supplemental pension benefits to certain key executives upon retirement based upon the executives’ years of service and compensation. The SERP was closed to new participants beginning in fiscal year 2015.

The SORP and SERP are effectively funded with assets held in a Rabbi Trust. The assets invested in the Rabbi Trust are to be used in part to fund benefit payments to participants under the terms of the plans. The Rabbi Trust is irrevocable and no portion of the trust funds may be used for any purpose other than the delivery of those assets to the participants, except that assets held in the Rabbi Trust would be subject to the claims of the Company’s general creditors in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company. The SORP and SERP are nonqualified plans for federal tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of ERISA. The Rabbi Trust assets had a value of $54.5 million at June 30, 2020 and $41.9 million at June 30, 2019 and are included in Other non-current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The benefit obligation to the Company under these plans at June 30, 2020 and 2019 was:

Other Post-retirement Benefit Plan

The Company sponsors an Executive Retiree Health Insurance Plan. It is a post-retirement benefit plan pursuant to which the Company helps defray the health care costs of certain eligible key executive retirees and qualifying dependents, based upon the retirees’ age and years of service, until they reach the age of 65. The plan is currently unfunded.

The benefit obligation to the Company under this plan at June 30, 2020 and 2019 was:

Other Post-employment Benefit Obligations

In accordance with the Payment of Gratuity Act of 1972, the Company sponsors a post-employment defined benefit plan (the “Gratuity Plan”) covering all employees in India who are eligible under the terms of their employment. The Gratuity Plan is required by local law and provides a lump sum payment to vested employees upon retirement, death, incapacitation, or termination of employment based on the respective employee’s salary and the tenure of employment. The Gratuity Plan is currently unfunded.

The benefit obligation to the Company under this plan at June 30, 2020 and 2019 was:


Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations to third parties as of June 30, 2020 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:

(1)

These amounts represent the principal repayments of Long-term debt and are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 13, “Borrowings” to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our Borrowings and related matters.

(2)

Includes estimated future interest payments on our long-term debt and interest and facility fee on the revolving credit facility.

(3)

We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment. The majority of our lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Certain facility and equipment leases require payment of maintenance, real estate taxes and related executory costs, and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices. Our future operating lease obligations could change if we exit certain contracts and if we enter into additional operating lease agreements. See Note 8, “Leases” to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our Leases and related matters.

(4)

Purchase obligations relate to payments to IBM related to the Amended IT Services Agreement that expires in June 2027, the IBM Private Cloud Agreement that expires in March 2030, and the Amended EU IT Services Agreement that expires in June 2029, as well as software license agreements including hosted software arrangements, and software and hardware maintenance and support agreements.

(5)

The Company has a future commitment to fund $3.5 million to an investee.

(6)

Due to the uncertainty related to the timing of the reversal of uncertain tax positions, only uncertain tax benefits related to certain settlements have been provided in the table above. The Company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates related to the timing of the remaining gross unrecognized tax benefit liability of $40.7 million (inclusive of interest).

Certain post-employment benefit obligations reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in the amount of $70.7 million as of June 30, 2020 were not included in the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these future payments.

Data Center Agreements

In March 2010, the Company and IBM entered into the IT Services Agreement, under which IBM provides certain aspects of the Company’s information technology infrastructure. Under the IT Services Agreement, IBM provides a broad range of technology services to the Company including supporting its mainframe, midrange, network and data center operations, as well as providing disaster recovery services. The migration of the data center processing to IBM was completed in August 2012. The IT Services Agreement would have expired on June 30, 2022, but a two-year extension was signed in March 2015, amending the expiration date to June 30, 2024. In December 2019, the Company and IBM amended and restated the IT Services Agreement and entered into the Amended IT Services Agreement, which now expires on June 30, 2027.  The Company has the option of incorporating additional services into the Amended IT Services Agreement over time. The Company may renew the term of the Amended IT Services Agreement for up to one additional 12-month period. Fixed minimum commitments remaining under this agreement at June 30, 2020 are $251.7 million through fiscal year 2027, the final year of the Amended IT Services Agreement.


In December 2019, the Company and IBM entered into an information technology agreement for private cloud services (“the IBM Private Cloud Agreement”) under which IBM will operate, manage and support the Company’s private cloud global distributed platforms and products, and operate and manage certain Company networks. The IBM Private Cloud Agreement has an initial term of approximately 10 years and three months, expiring on March 31, 2030. As a result of the IBM Private Cloud Agreement, the Company transferred certain of its employees in April 2020 to IBM and its affiliates, and such transferred employees are expected to continue providing services to the Company on behalf of IBM under the IBM Private Cloud Agreement. Pursuant to the IBM Private Cloud Agreement, the Company has agreed to transfer the ownership of certain Company-owned hardware (the “Hardware”) located at Company facilities worldwide along with the Company’s maintenance agreements (“Maintenance Contracts”) associated with the Hardware to IBM. The transfer of the Hardware and Maintenance Contracts to IBM is expected to close no later than September 30, 2020. The Company concluded that the Hardware qualifies as assets held for sale since the Company has committed to a plan of disposal expected to be completed within a year, and therefore, has recorded the Hardware at fair value less costs to dispose based on the expected selling price to IBM (a Level 3 fair value measurement as defined in Note 7, “Fair Value of Financial Instruments” to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements). Accordingly, the Company has recorded a non-cash pre-tax charge of

$30.4

million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, equal to the difference between the Hardware’s carrying value and estimated fair value less costs to dispose, included as part of Cost of revenues on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Earnings and is included in Other for purposes of the Company's segment reporting. As of June 30, 2020, the Hardware classified as assets held for sale has a carrying amount of $18.0 million and is included in the Company’s Other current assets line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Fixed minimum commitments remaining under the IBM Private Cloud Agreement at June 30, 2020 are

$236.7 million

through March 31, 2030, the final year of the contract.

In March 2014, the Company and IBM United Kingdom Limited (“IBM UK”) entered into the EU IT Services Agreement, under which IBM UK provides data center services supporting the Company’s technology outsourcing services for certain clients in Europe and Asia. The EU IT Services Agreement would have expired in October 2023. In December 2019, the Company amended the existing EU IT Services Agreement and entered into the Amended EU IT Services Agreement whereby the Company will migrate from the existing dedicated on-premise solution to a managed Broadridge private cloud environment provided by IBM, as well as extended the term of the EU IT Services Agreement to June 2029.  The Company has the right to renew the term of the Amended EU IT Services Agreement for up to one additional 12-month period or one additional 24-month period. Fixed minimum commitments remaining under the Amended EU IT Services Agreement at June 30, 2020 are $23.9 million through fiscal year 2029, the final year of the contract.

The following table summarizes the capitalized costs related to these agreements as of June 30, 2020:

Investments

At June 30, 2020, the Company has a future commitment to fund $3.5 million to one of the Company’s investees.

Other Commercial Agreements

Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries established unsecured, uncommitted lines of credit with banks. There were no outstanding borrowings under these lines of credit at June 30, 2020.


Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

It is not the Company’s business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. However, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The Company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company was not a party to any derivative financial instruments at June 30, 2020 and 2019. In the normal course of business, the Company also enters into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the Company’s products and services. The Company does not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties, or collateral arrangements.

Recently-issued Accounting Pronouncements

Please refer to Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 8, “Leases” to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion on the impact of the adoption of new accounting pronouncements.

ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market Risks

In the ordinary course of business, the financial position of the Company is routinely subject to certain market risks, notably the effects of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities. As a result, the Company does not anticipate any material losses from these risks. The Company was not a party to any derivative financial instrument as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Interest Rate Risk

As of June 30, 2020, $149.8 million, or 8%, of the Company’s total outstanding debt balance of $1,787.5 million is based on floating interest rates. Our $149.8 million in variable rate debt at June 30, 2020 consists of our revolving credit facility, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 101.5 basis points on borrowed amounts, plus an additional annual facility fee equal to 11.0 basis points on the entire facility. We have assessed our exposure to changes in interest rates by analyzing the sensitivity to our earnings of a change in market interest rates on amounts borrowed from the revolving credit facility during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. Assuming a hypothetical increase of one hundred basis points in interest rates on our variable rate debt during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, our pre-tax earnings would have decreased by approximately $5.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020; however, this would have been offset by interest earned on cash balances.

Foreign Currency Risk

While the substantial majority of our business is conducted within the U.S., approximately 12% of our fiscal year 2020 revenues were earned outside of the U.S. and approximately 23% of our total consolidated assets as of June 30, 2020 resided in our foreign subsidiaries. Our revenue generating operations outside of the U.S. primarily reside in Canada and the United Kingdom. As a result, we have a certain degree of foreign currency exposure to exchange rate fluctuations associated with our non-U.S. revenue generating operations, primarily with respect to the Canadian dollar and the British pound.

We manage our foreign currency risk primarily by incurring, to the extent practicable, operating and financing expenses in the local currency in the countries in which we operate. We do not hedge our operating results against currency movement as they are primarily translational in nature. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, a hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of the Canadian dollar and British pound versus the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a decrease in our total pre-tax earnings of approximately $13.1 million. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of the Canadian dollar and British pound versus the U.S. dollar at June 30, 2020 would have resulted in a decrease to our total assets of approximately $84.3 million.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2020, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by COSO.

Changes in Accounting Principle

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases as of July 1, 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the U.S. and in accordance with the SEC requirements for Annual Reports on Form 10-K. These financial statements present the consolidated position of the Company and include the entities in which the Company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest as well as various entities in which the Company has investments recorded under the equity method of accounting as well as certain marketable and non-marketable securities. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Amounts presented may not sum due to rounding. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation where applicable, except as it relates to (i) Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Update  (“ASU”) No. 2016-02 “Leases”, as amended (“ASU No. 2016-02”), (ii) No. 2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” and its related amendments (collectively “ASU No. 2014-09”), (iii) ASU No. 2016-01, “Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“ASU No. 2016-01”), and (iv) ASU No. 2018-02, “Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income” (“ASU No. 2018-02”), as described further below.

Effective July 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, by recognizing a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and corresponding lease liability, along with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings, in the period of adoption. Under this method of adoption, the Company has not restated the prior period Consolidated Financial Statements presented to the current period presentation. Additional information about the impact of the Company’s adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, is included in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 8, “Leases”.

Effective July 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09 using the modified retrospective transition approach applied to all contracts. Under this transition approach, the Company has not restated the prior period Consolidated Financial Statements presented to the current period presentation. Additional information about the Company’s revenue recognition policies and the related impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 is included in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 3, “Revenue Recognition”.


Effective July 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-01, which requires changes in the fair value of publicly traded equity securities for which the Company does not have significant influence to be recorded as part of Net earnings rather than as Other comprehensive income (loss), net. In addition, equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value will be recorded at cost less impairment as further adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the issuer. The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-01 using the modified-retrospective transition approach by recording the cumulative effect of previously unrecognized gains or losses on publicly traded equity securities to retained earnings as of July 1, 2018. The provisions of ASU No. 2016-01 relative to equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value have been applied prospectively. The Consolidated Financial Statements have not been revised for periods prior to July 1, 2018. The impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-01 resulted in a reclassification of less than $

0.1

million in unrealized gains, net from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings as of July 1, 2018.

Effective July 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2018-02, which allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects associated with the change in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) enacted in December 2017. The adoption of ASU No. 2018-02 resulted in an increase to retained earnings of $

1.5

million.

Effective July 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2017-07, “Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost” (“ASU No. 2017-07”) whereby the Company revised its presentation in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings to reflect the non-service cost components of net benefit cost as part of Other nonoperating income (expenses), net, which were previously recorded as part of Total operating expenses. All prior period information has been conformed to the current period presentation.

NOTE 2.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes thereto. These estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events, historical experience, actions that the Company may undertake in the future and on various other assumptions and judgment that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. The use of estimates in specific accounting policies is described further in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as appropriate.

B.

Revenue Recognition.

ASU No. 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The core principle is that an entity recognizes revenue to reflect the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company’s revenues from clients are primarily generated from fees for providing investor communications and technology-enabled services and solutions. Revenues are recognized for the

two

reportable segments as follows:

•

Investor Communication Solutions

—Revenues are generated primarily from processing and distributing investor communications and other related services as well as vote processing and tabulation. The Company typically enters into agreements with clients to provide services on a fee for service basis. Fees received for processing and distributing investor communications are generally variably priced and recognized as revenue over time as the Company provides the services to clients based on the number of units processed, which coincides with the pattern of value transfer to the client. Broadridge works directly with corporate issuers (“Issuers”) and mutual funds to ensure that the account holders of the Company’s bank and broker clients, who are also the shareholders of Issuers and mutual funds, receive the appropriate investor communications materials and that the services are fulfilled in accordance with each Issuer’s and mutual fund’s requirements. Broadridge works directly with the Issuers and mutual funds to resolve any issues that may arise. As such, Issuers and mutual funds are viewed as the customer of the Company’s services. As a result, revenues for distribution services as well as proxy materials fulfillment services are recorded in Revenue on a gross basis with corresponding costs including amounts remitted to the broker-dealers and banks (referred to as “Nominees”) recorded in Cost of revenues. Fees for the Company’s investor communications services arrangements are typically billed and paid on a monthly basis following the delivery of the services. The Company also offers certain hosted service arrangements that can be priced on a fixed and/or variable basis for which revenue is recognized over time as the Company satisfies its performance obligation by delivering services to the client on a monthly basis based on the number of transactions processed or units delivered, in the case of variable priced arrangements, or a fixed monthly fee in the case of fixed price arrangements, in each case which coincides with the pattern of value transfer to the client. These services may be billed in a variety of payment frequencies depending on the specific arrangement.


•

Global Technology and Operations

—Revenues are generated primarily from fees for trade processing and related services. Revenue is recognized over time as the Company satisfies its performance obligation by delivering services to the client. The Company’s arrangements for processing and related services typically consist of an obligation to provide specific services to its clients on a when and if needed basis (a stand ready obligation) with revenue recognized from the satisfaction of the performance obligations on a monthly basis generally in the amount billable to the client. These services are generally provided under variable priced arrangements based on volume of service and can include minimum monthly usage fees. Client service agreements often include up-front consideration in addition to the recurring fee for trade processing. Up-front implementation fees, as well as certain enhancements to existing technology platforms, are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the service term of the contract which corresponds to the timing of transfer of value to the client that commences after client acceptance when the processing term begins. In addition, revenue is also generated from the fulfillment of professional services engagements which are generally priced on a time and materials or fixed price basis, and are recognized as the services are provided to the client which corresponds to the timing of transfer of value to the client. Finally, the Company recognizes license revenues from software term licenses installed on clients’ premises upon delivery and acceptance of the software license, assuming a contract is deemed to exist. Software term license revenue is not a significant portion of the Company’s revenues.

The Company uses the following methods, inputs, and assumptions in determining amounts of revenue to recognize:

Identification of Performance Obligations

For revenue arrangements containing multiple goods or services, the Company accounts for the individual goods or services as a separate performance obligation if they are distinct, the good or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement, and if a client can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the client. If these criteria are not met, the promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.

Transaction Price

Once separate performance obligations are determined, the transaction price is allocated to the individual performance obligations within a contract. If the contracted prices reflect the relative standalone selling prices

for the individual performance obligations, no allocations are made. Otherwise, the Company uses the relative selling price method to allocate the transaction price, obtained from sources such as the observable price of a good or service when the Company sells that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to similar clients. If such evidence is unavailable, the Company uses the best estimate of the selling price, which includes various internal factors such as pricing strategy and market factors. A significant portion of the Company’s performance obligations are generated from transactions with volume based fees and includes services that are delivered at the same time. The Company recognizes revenue related to these arrangements over time as the services are provided to the client. While many of the Company’s contracts contain some component of variable consideration, the Company only recognizes variable consideration that is not expected to reverse. The Company allocates variable payments to distinct services in an overall contract when the variable payment relates specifically to that particular service and for which the variable payment reflects what the Company expects to receive in exchange for that particular service. As a result, the Company generally allocates and recognizes variable consideration in the period it has the contractual right to invoice the client.

As described above, our most significant performance obligations involve variable consideration which constitutes the majority of our revenue streams. The Company’s variable consideration components meet the criteria in ASU No. 2014-09 for exclusion from disclosure of the remaining transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations as does any contracts with clients with an original duration of one year or less. The Company has contracts with clients that vary in length depending on the nature of the services and contractual terms negotiated with the client, and they generally extend over a multi-year period.

Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a client, are excluded from revenue. Distribution revenues associated with shipping and handling activities are accounted for as a fulfillment activity and recognized as the related services or products are transferred to the client. As a practical expedient, the Company does not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component if, at contract inception, the period between client payment and the transfer of goods or services is expected to be one year or less.

C.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Investment securities with an original maturity of


days or less are considered cash equivalents. The fair value of the Company’s Cash and cash equivalents approximates carrying value due to their short term nature.


D.

Financial Instruments.

Substantially all of the financial instruments of the Company other than Long-term debt are carried at fair values, or at carrying amounts that approximate fair values because of the short maturity of the instruments. The carrying value of the Company’s long-term fixed-rate senior notes represent the face value of the long-term fixed-rate senior notes net of the unamortized discount and net of the associated unamortized debt issuance cost. The fair value of the Company’s long-term fixed-rate senior notes is based on quoted market prices.

Refer to Note 13, “Borrowings,” for a further description of the Company’s long-term fixed-rate senior notes.

E.

Property, Plant and Equipment.

Property, plant and equipment is initially recorded at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the improvements.

The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:

Refer to Note 9, “Property, Plant and Equipment, Net”, for a further description of the Company’s Property, plant and equipment, net.

F.

Securities.

Securities are non-derivatives that are reflected in Other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, unless management intends to dispose of the investment within twelve months of the end of the reporting period, in which case they are reflected in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These investments are in entities over which the Company does not have control, joint control, or significant influence. Securities that have a readily determinable fair value are carried at fair value. Securities without a readily determinable fair value are initially recognized at cost and subsequently carried at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer, such as subsequent capital raising transactions. Changes in the value of securities with or without a readily determinable fair value are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. In determining whether a security without a readily determinable fair value is impaired, management considers qualitative factors to identify an impairment including the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer.

G.

Inventories.

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (determined on a first-in, first-out basis) or market.

Inventory balances of $

21.5

million and $

21.1

million, consisting of forms and envelopes used in the mailing of proxy and other materials to our customers, are reflected in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

H.

Deferred Client Conversion and Start-Up Costs.

Direct costs incurred to set up or convert a client’s systems to function with the Company’s technology, that are expected to be recovered, are generally deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the service term of the arrangement to which the costs relate, which commences after client acceptance when the processing term begins. The Company evaluates the carrying value of deferred client conversion and start-up costs for impairment on the basis of whether these costs are fully recoverable from the expected future undiscounted net operating cash flows of the client to which the deferred costs relate.

These deferred costs are reflected in Other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively. Refer to Note 11, “Other Non-Current Assets” for a further description of the Company’s Deferred client conversion and start-up costs.

I.

Deferred Sales Commission Costs.

The Company defers incremental costs to obtain a client contract that it expects to recover, which consists of sales commissions incurred, only if the contract is executed. Deferred sales commission costs are amortized on a straight-line basis using a portfolio approach consistent with the pattern of transfer of the goods or services to which the asset relates, which also considers expected customer lives. As a practical expedient, the Company recognizes the sales commissions as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the sales commission asset that the entity otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. The Company evaluates the carrying value of deferred sales commission costs for impairment on the basis of whether these costs are fully recoverable from the expected future undiscounted net operating cash flows of the portfolio of clients to which the deferred sales commission costs relate. Refer to Note 11, “Other Non-Current Assets” for a further description of the Company’s Deferred sales commission costs.

J.

Deferred Data Center Costs.

Data center costs relate to conversion costs associated with our principal data center systems and applications. Costs directly related to the activities necessary to make the data center usable for its intended purpose are deferred and amortized over the life of the contract on a straight-line basis commencing on the date the data center has achieved full functionality.

These deferred costs are reflected in Other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Refer to Note 11, “Other Non-Current Assets” for a further description of the Company’s Deferred data center costs.


K.

Goodwill.

The Company does not amortize goodwill but instead tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment. The Company tests for goodwill impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, using the March 31 financial statement balances. The Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company determines the fair value of its reporting units using the income approach, which considers a discounted future cash flow analysis using various assumptions, including projections of revenues based on assumed long-term growth rates, estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular reporting unit’s weighted-average cost of capital. The principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows based on forecasted earnings before interest and taxes, and the selection of the terminal value growth rate and discount rate assumptions. The weighted-average cost of capital takes into account the relative weight of each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and long-term debt). The estimates of long-term growth and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of external sources, and are developed as part of the Company’s routine, long-range planning process. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined.

Refer to Note 10, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net” for a further description on the Company’s accounting for goodwill.

L.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset (or asset group). If the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) exceeds its expected estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset (or asset group) exceeds its fair value. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized primarily on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives and are also reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

Refer to Note 9, “Property, Plant and Equipment, Net” for a further description of the Company’s Property, plant and equipment, net. Refer to Note 6, “Acquisitions” and Note 10, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net” for a further description of the Company’s Intangible assets, net.

M.

Equity Method Investments

.

The Company’s investments resulting in a 20% to 50% ownership interest are accounted for using the equity method of accounting when the ability to exercise significant influence is maintained by the Company. The Company’s share of net income or losses of equity method investments is included in Other non-operating income (expenses), net. Equity method investments are included in Other non-current assets. Equity method investments are reviewed for impairment by assessing if a decline in market value of the investment below the carrying value is other than temporary, which considers the intent and ability to retain the investment, the length of time and extent that the market value has been less than cost, and the financial condition of the investee.

N.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions.

The assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars based on exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the periods. Currency transaction gains or losses are included in Non-operating income (expenses), net. Gains or losses from balance sheet translation are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

O.

Distribution Cost of Revenues.

Distribution cost of revenues consists primarily of postage related expenses incurred in connection with the Company’s Investor Communication Solutions segment, as well as Matrix Financial Solutions, Inc. administrative services expenses. These costs are reflected in Cost of revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

P.

Stock-Based Compensation.

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation by recognizing the measurement of stock-based compensation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. For stock options issued, the fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model. The binomial model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of the Company’s stock price, and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk-free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. For restricted stock units, the fair value of the award is based on the current fair value of the Company’s stock on the date of grant less the present value of future expected dividends discounted at the risk-free-rate derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

Refer to Note 15, “Stock-Based Compensation” for a further description of the Company’s stock-based compensation.


Q.

Internal Use Software.

Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized generally over a

three

- to

five

-year period on a straight-line basis. For software developed or obtained for internal use, the Company’s accounting policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software. In addition, the Company also capitalizes payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects. The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to direct time spent on such projects. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance, and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred. The Company also expenses internal costs related to minor upgrades and enhancements, as it is impractical to separate these costs from normal maintenance activities.

Refer to Note 10, “Goodwill and Intangible assets, Net” for a further description of the Company’s capitalized software.

R.

Income Taxes.

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.

Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the Company will not be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to net operating and capital loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings. The determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be recognized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income, carryforward periods, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies. Projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions

as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned. The assumptions used to project future taxable income requires

significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses.

Refer to Note 17, “Income Taxes” for a further description of the Company’s income taxes.

New Accounting Pronouncements.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, as subsequently amended by ASU No. 2018-10, “Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases,” ASU No. 2018-11, “Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements,” and ASU No. 2018-20, “Leases (Topic 842):  Narrow Scope Improvements for Lessors" (collectively referred to herein as “ASU No. 2016-02, as amended”). Under ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, all lease arrangements, with certain limited exceptions, exceeding a twelve-month term must now be recognized as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet of the lessee by recording a ROU asset and corresponding lease obligation generally equal to the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term. Further, the income statement will reflect lease expense for leases classified as operating and amortization/interest expense for leases classified as financing, determined using classification criteria substantially similar to the current lease guidance for distinguishing between an operating and capital lease. ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, also contains certain additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures to supplement the amounts recorded in the financial statements so that users can understand more about the nature of an entity’s leasing activities, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, was effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 and could have been adopted using either a modified retrospective basis which required adjustment to all comparative periods presented in the consolidated financial statements, or by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at the date of initial application.


Accordingly, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, by recognizing a ROU asset and corresponding lease liability, along with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings, in the period of adoption. Under this method of adoption, the Company has not restated the prior period Consolidated Financial Statements presented to the current period presentation. The Company elected the transition package of three practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance in ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, to not reassess prior conclusions related to whether (i) a contract contains a lease, (ii) the classification of an existing lease, and (iii) the accounting for initial direct costs. The Company also elected accounting policies to (i) not separate the non-lease components of a contract from the lease component to which they relate, and (ii) not recognize assets or liabilities for leases with a term of twelve months or less and no purchase option that the Company is reasonably certain of exercising.

On the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July 1, 2019, the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, resulted in the recognition of lease liabilities of $

252.0

million and ROU assets of $

235.4

million, which include the impact of existing deferred rents and tenant improvement allowances for operating leases, as well as a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings of $

0.2

million. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, or the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity.

Effective July 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09. ASU No. 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most prior revenue recognition guidance, including industry specific requirements. It also includes guidance on accounting for the incremental costs of obtaining and costs incurred to fulfill a contract with a customer. The core principle of the revenue model is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU No. 2014-09 also requires certain enhanced disclosures, including disclosures on the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers.

The Company identified certain impacts of ASU No. 2014-09 on its Consolidated Financial Statements. Specifically, under ASU No. 2014-09, the Company now capitalizes certain sales commissions, and it capitalizes certain additional costs that are part of setting up or converting a client’s systems to function with the Company’s technology, both of which were previously expensed. Additionally, the Company now recognizes proxy revenue primarily at the time of proxy materials distribution to the client’s shareholders rather than on the date of the client’s shareholder meeting, which is typically 30 days after the proxy materials distribution. Other changes to the timing of revenue recognition include deferral of revenue from certain transaction processing platform enhancements as well as acceleration of revenue from certain multi-year software license arrangements that was previously recognized over the term of the software subscription.

The Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09 effective July 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to all contracts, which resulted in a cumulative-effect increase in the opening balance of retained earnings of $

101.3

million, most notably related to the deferral of incremental sales commissions incurred in obtaining contracts in prior periods. Under this transition approach, the Company did not restate the prior period Consolidated Financial Statements presented. See Note 3, “Revenue Recognition” for additional information about the Company’s revenue recognition policies.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software: Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract” (“ASU No. 2018-15”), which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements under GAAP for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. ASU No. 2018-15 will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. Entities are permitted to apply either a retrospective or prospective transition approach to adopt the guidance. The pending adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses” (“ASU No. 2016-13”), which prescribes an impairment model for most financial instruments based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under this model, an estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual life of the instrument is to be recorded as of the end of a reporting period as an allowance to offset the amortized cost basis, resulting in a net presentation of the amount expected to be collected on the financial instrument. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. For most instruments, entities must apply the standard using a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The pending adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

NOTE 3.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Disaggregation of Revenue

The Company has presented below its revenue disaggregated by product line and by revenue type within each of its Investor Communication Solutions and Global Technology and Operations reportable segments.

Fee revenues in the Investor Communication Solutions segment are derived from both recurring and event-driven activity. In addition, the level of recurring and event-driven activity the Company processes directly impacts distribution revenues. While event-driven activity is highly repeatable, it may not recur on an annual basis. Event-driven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions the Company processes. Event-driven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements, resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of event-driven fee revenues. Distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials, interim communications, transaction reporting, customer communications and fulfillment services, as well as Matrix administrative services.


Contract Balances

The following table provides information about contract assets and liabilities:

Contract assets result from revenue already recognized but not yet invoiced, including certain future amounts to be collected under software term licenses and certain other client contracts. Contract liabilities represent consideration received or receivable from clients before the transfer of control occurs (deferred revenue). Contract balances are reported in a net contract asset or liability position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, contract assets increased primarily due to an increase in software term license revenues recognized but not yet invoiced, while contract liabilities increased primarily due to recent acquisitions and the timing of client payments. The Company recognized $

141.2

million of revenue during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 that was


included in the contract liability balance as of June 30, 2019. The Company recognized $

96.4

million of revenue during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 that was included in the contract liability balance as of July 1, 2018.

NOTE 4.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated by dividing the Company’s Net earnings by the basic Weighted-average shares outstanding for the periods presented. The Company calculates diluted EPS using the treasury stock method, which reflects the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding stock options at the presented date are exercised and restricted stock unit awards have vested.

As of June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the computation of diluted EPS did not include

0.5

million,

0.4

million and

1.1

million options to purchase Broadridge common stock, respectively, as the effect of their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

The following table sets forth the denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations:

NOTE 7.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Accounting guidance on fair value measurements for certain financial assets and liabilities requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:

In valuing assets and liabilities, the Company is required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company calculates the fair value of its Level 1 and Level 2 instruments, as applicable, based on the exchange traded price of similar or identical instruments where available or based on other observable instruments. These calculations take into consideration the credit risk of both the Company and its counterparties. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period.


The fair value of the contingent consideration obligations are based on a probability weighted approach derived from the estimates of earn-out criteria and the probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving those criteria. The measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, therefore, the Company classifies this liability as Level 3 in the table below.

The following tables set forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period, segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy:

(1)

Money market funds include money market deposit account balances of $

150.1

million and $

30.1

million as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

In addition, the Company has non-marketable securities with a carrying amount of $

33.3

million as of June 30, 2020 and $

12.9

million as of June 30, 2019 that are classified as Level 2 financial assets and included as part of Other non-current assets.

The following table sets forth an analysis of changes during fiscal years 2020 and 2019 in Level 3 financial liabilities of the Company:


The Company did not incur any Level 3 fair value asset impairments during fiscal year 2020 or fiscal year 2019. Changes in economic conditions or model based valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments between levels. The Company’s policy is to record transfers between levels if any, as of the beginning of the fiscal year.

NOTE 8.

LEASES

The Company’s leases consist primarily of real estate leases in locations where the Company maintains operations, and are classified as operating leases.

The Company evaluates each lease and service arrangement at inception to determine if the arrangement is, or contains, a lease. A lease exists if the Company obtains substantially all of the economic benefits of and has the right to control the use of an asset for a period of time. The lease term begins on the commencement date, which is the date the Company takes possession of the leased property and also classifies the lease as either operating or finance, and may include options to extend or terminate the lease if exercise of the option to extend or terminate the lease is considered to be reasonably certain. The Company’s options to extend or terminate a lease generally do not exceed

five

years. The lease term is used both to determine lease classification as an operating or finance lease and to calculate straight-line lease expense for operating leases. The weighted average remaining operating lease term as of June 30, 2020 was


years.

ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term while lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of fixed lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets also include prepaid lease payments and exclude lease incentives received. Certain leases require the Company to pay taxes, insurance, maintenance, and/or other operating expenses associated with the leased asset. Such amounts are not included in the measurement of the lease liability to the extent they are variable in nature (e.g. based on actual costs incurred). These variable lease costs are recognized as a variable lease expense when incurred. As the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to measure the lease liability and the associated ROU asset at commencement date. The incremental borrowing rate was determined based on the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. The Company uses the unsecured borrowing rate and risk-adjusts that rate to approximate a collateralized rate. The weighted average discount rate used in measurement of the Company’s operating lease liabilities as of June 30, 2020 was

3.1

%.

no

impairment. The Company also performs a sensitivity analysis under Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test assuming hypothetical reductions in the fair values of the reporting units. A


% change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows, discount rates, or terminal value growth rates, which are the most significant estimates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units, would not result in an impairment of our goodwill.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Incentive Equity Awards

. The Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. 2007 Omnibus Award Plan (the “2007 Plan”) and 2018 Omnibus Award Plan (the “2018 Plan”) provide for the granting of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, phantom stock awards, stock bonuses and performance compensation awards to employees, non-employee directors, and other key individuals who perform services for the Company. The 2018 Plan was approved by shareholders in November 2018 and replaced the 2007 Plan. The accounting for stock-based compensation requires the measurement of stock-based compensation expense to be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. In accordance with the 2007 Plan and 2018 Plan, the Company’s stock-based compensation consists of the following:

Stock Options:

Stock options are granted to employees at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the dates of grant. Stock options are generally issued under a graded vesting schedule, meaning that they vest ratably over

four years

, and have a term of


years. A portion of the stock options granted in fiscal year 2018 have a cliff vesting schedule meaning that they fully vest in

four years

from the grant date and have a term of


years. Compensation expense for stock options under a graded vesting schedule is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the stock option award. Compensation expense for stock options under a cliff vesting schedule is recognized equally over the vesting period of

four years

with


percent of the cost recognized over each


months period net of estimated forfeitures.

Time-based Restricted Stock Units:

The Company has a time-based restricted stock unit (“RSU”) program under which RSUs representing the right to receive

one

share of the Company’s common stock for each vested RSU are granted. Time-based RSUs typically vest two and one-half years from the date of grant. The Company records stock compensation expense for time-based RSUs net of estimated forfeitures on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

Performance-based Restricted Stock Units:

The Company has a performance-based RSU program under which RSUs representing the right to receive

one

share of the Company’s common stock for each vested RSU are granted. RSUs vest upon the achievement by the Company of specific performance metrics. The Company records stock compensation expense for performance-based RSUs net of estimated forfeitures on a straight-line basis over the performance period, plus a subsequent vesting period, which typically totals approximately two and one-half years from the date of grant.


The activity related to the Company’s incentive equity awards for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 consisted of the following:

(a)

Stock options exercised during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 had intrinsic values of $

68.9

million, $

65.8

million and $

116.3

million, respectively.

(b)

Time-based RSUs that vested during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 had a total fair value of $

38.4

million, $

45.4

million and $

50.6

million, respectively. Performance-based RSUs that vested during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 had a total fair value of $

16.5

million, $

21.7

million and $

19.1

million, respectively.

(c)

As of June 30, 2020, the Company’s outstanding stock options using the fiscal year-end share price of $

126.19

had an aggregate intrinsic value of $

193.1

million. As of June 30, 2020, the Company’s outstanding “in the money” vested stock options using the fiscal year-end share price of $

126.19

had an aggregate intrinsic value of $

145.8

million. As of June 30, 2020, time-based RSUs and performance-based RSUs expected to vest using the fiscal year-end share price of $

126.19

(approximately

0.7

million and

0.2

million shares, respectively) had an aggregate intrinsic value of $

83.7

million and $

30.3

million, respectively. Performance-based RSUs granted in the table above represent initial target awards, and performance adjustments for (i) change in shares issued based upon attainment of performance goals determined in the period, and (ii) estimated change in shares issued resulting from attainment of performance goals to be determined at the end of the prospective performance period.


The tables below summarize information regarding the Company’s outstanding and exercisable stock options as of June 30, 2020:

(a) Calculated using the closing stock price on the last trading day of fiscal year 2020 of $

126.19

, less the option exercise price, multiplied by the number of instruments.

Stock-based compensation expense of $

60.8

million, $

58.4

million, and $

55.1

million was recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as well as related tax benefits of

$

13.5

million

, $

13.5

million, and $

15.7

million, respectively.

As of June 30, 2020, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options and RSU awards amounted to $

14.9

million and $

45.6

million, respectively, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service periods of

1.9

years and

1.5

years, respectively.

In April 2013, the Company began reissuing treasury stock to satisfy stock option exercises and issuances under the Company’s RSU awards. From time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase programs. The Company repurchased

0.4

million shares in fiscal year 2020 under our share repurchase program as compared to

3.2

million shares repurchased in fiscal year 2019, which excludes shares withheld by the Company to cover payroll taxes on the vesting of RSU awards, which are also accounted for as treasury stock. The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.


The following table presents the assumptions used to determine the fair values of the stock option grants using the Binomial options pricing model during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018:

NOTE 16.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

A. Defined Contribution Savings Plans.

The Company sponsors a 401(k) savings plan covering eligible U.S. employees of the Company. This plan provides a base contribution plus Company matching contributions on a portion of employee contributions.

An Executive Retirement and Savings Plan (the “ERSP”) was adopted effective January 1, 2015 for those executives who are not participants in the Broadridge SORP or Broadridge SERP (defined below). The ERSP is a defined contribution plan that allows eligible full-time U.S. employees to defer compensation until a later date and the Company will match a portion of the deferred compensation above the qualified defined contribution compensation and deferral limitations.

The costs recorded by the Company for these plans were:

B. Defined Benefit Pension Plans.

The Company sponsors a Supplemental Officer Retirement Plan (the “SORP”). The SORP is a nonqualified ERISA defined benefit plan pursuant to which the Company will pay supplemental pension benefits to certain key officers upon retirement based upon the officers’ years of service and compensation. The SORP was closed to new participants beginning in fiscal year 2015. The Company also sponsors a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the “SERP”). The SERP is also a nonqualified ERISA defined benefit plan pursuant to which the Company will pay supplemental pension benefits to certain key executives upon retirement based upon the executives’ years of service and compensation. The SERP was closed to new participants beginning in fiscal year 2015.

The SORP

and SERP are effectively funded with assets held in a Rabbi Trust. The assets invested in the Rabbi Trust are to be used in part to fund benefit payments to participants under the terms of the plans. The Rabbi Trust is irrevocable and no portion of the trust funds may be used for any purpose other than the delivery of those assets to the participants, except that assets held in the Rabbi Trust would be subject to the claims of the Company’s general creditors in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company. The SORP and SERP are nonqualified plans for federal tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of ERISA. The Rabbi Trust assets had a value of $

54.5

million at June 30, 2020 and $

41.9

million at June 30, 2019 and are included in Other non-current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.


The amounts charged to expense by the Company for these plans were:

The benefit obligation to the Company under these plans at June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was:

C. Other Post-retirement Benefit Plan.

The Company sponsors an Executive Retiree Health Insurance Plan. It is a post-retirement benefit plan pursuant to which the Company helps defray the health care costs of certain eligible key executive retirees and qualifying dependents, based upon the retirees’ age and years of service, until they reach the age of


. The plan is currently unfunded.

The amounts charged to expense by the Company for this plan were:

The benefit obligation to the Company under this plan at June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was:

D. Other Post-employment Benefit Obligations.

The Company sponsors a post-employment plan (the “Gratuity Plan”) covering all employees in India who are eligible under the terms of their employment. The Gratuity Plan is required by local law and provides a lump sum payment to vested employees upon retirement, death, incapacitation, or termination of employment based on the respective employee’s salary and the tenure of employment. The Gratuity Plan is currently unfunded.

The amounts charged to expense by the Company for this plan were:

The benefit obligation to the Company under this plan at June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was:


NOTE 17.

INCOME TAXES

Earnings before income taxes shown below are based on the geographic location to which such earnings are attributable.

The Provision for income taxes consists of the following components:


The Provision for income taxes and effective tax rates for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 were $

117.0

million and

20.2

%, compared to $

125.2

million and

20.6

%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 was primarily driven by higher discrete benefits, partially offset by lower ETB of $

15.6

million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 compared to $

19.3

million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.

The Provision for income taxes and effective tax rates for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 were $

125.2

million and

20.6

%, compared to $

133.1

million and

23.7

%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 is primarily due to a reduced statutory U.S. federal tax rate as well as a prior period net tax charge relating to the enactment of the Tax Act, partially offset by the recognition of lower ETB attributable to stock-based compensation compared to the ETB recognized in fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. In the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, the Company’s federal corporate statutory income tax rate was

21.0

% compared to a blended tax rate of

28.1

% for the prior fiscal year. In addition, notwithstanding the reduction in the federal corporate statutory income tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Tax Act required the Company to accrue a transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2017, and which in turn led to the accrual of applicable foreign withholding taxes to repatriate such earnings subject to the transition tax. At June 30, 2018 the Company estimated the transition tax and applicable foreign withholding taxes to be approximately $

30.8

million, partially offset by a benefit of approximately $

15.3

million relating to the remeasurement of the Company’s net deferred tax liabilities. The SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) which provided the Company with up to one year to finalize accounting for the impacts of the Tax Act. Under SAB 118, the Company finalized the prior year estimate of the transition tax and applicable withholding taxes and recognized a tax benefit of approximately $

0.5

million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. In addition to the lower corporate tax rate, the Tax Act introduced two new federal tax provisions relating to foreign source earnings, (i) a minimum tax on global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”) and (ii) a deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”). Both provisions were effective beginning with the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, and on a net basis generated a tax benefit of approximately $

1.8

million.

As of June 30, 2020, the Company had approximately $

525.4

million of accumulated earnings and profits attributable to foreign subsidiaries. The Company considers $

265.0

million of accumulated earnings attributable to foreign subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. and has not determined the cost to repatriate such earnings since it is not practicable to calculate the amount of income taxes payable in the event all such foreign earnings are repatriated. The Company does not consider the remaining $

260.4

million of accumulated earnings to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. The Company has accrued approximately $

8.9

million of foreign withholding taxes and $

0.6

million of state income taxes attributable to such earnings.


Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse.

Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities at June 30, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:

The Company has estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $

13.1

million as of June 30, 2020 of which $

1.5

million expires in the June 30, 2020 through June 30, 2028 period, and of which $

11.6

million has an indefinite utilization period. In addition, the Company has estimated U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $

37.0

million of which $

16.9

million can be utilized through June 30, 2030 with the balance of $

20.2

million having an indefinite utilization period.

Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the Company will not be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to net operating and capital loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings. The Company has recorded valuation allowances of $

6.7

million and $

3.3

million at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be recognized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income, carryforward periods, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies. Projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned. The assumptions used to project future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses.

In the next twelve months, the Company does not expect a material change to its net reserve balance for unrecognized tax benefits.


The following table summarizes the activity related to the Company’s gross unrecognized tax positions:

As of June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the net reserve for unrecognized tax positions recorded by the Company that is included in the preceding table of gross unrecognized tax positions was $

33.8

million, $

33.4

million, and $

19.4

million respectively, and if reversed in full, would favorably

affect the effective tax rate by these amounts, respectively.

The $

9.5

million, $

2.6

million and $

2.4

million gross decreases in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for prior period tax positions related to certain tax audit settlements and certain state, federal and foreign statute of limitation expirations.

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, the Company adjusted accrued interest by approximately less than $

0.1

million and recognized a total liability for interest on unrecognized tax positions of $

3.6

million; in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, the Company adjusted accrued interest by approximately $(

0.1

) million and recognized a total liability of $

3.6

million for interest on unrecognized tax positions; in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 the Company adjusted accrued interest by approximately $

0.5

million and recognized a total liability of $

3.7

million for interest on unrecognized tax positions.

The Company is regularly subject to examination of its income tax returns by U.S. Federal, state and foreign income tax authorities. The tax years that are currently open and could be subject to income tax audits for U.S. federal and most state and local jurisdictions are fiscal years ending June 30, 2013 through June 30, 2020, and for Canadian operations that could be subject to audit in Canada, fiscal years ending June 30, 2015 through June 30, 2020. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements.

CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES, AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Data Center Agreements

In March 2010, the Company and IBM entered into an Information Technology Services Agreement (the “IT Services Agreement”), under which IBM provides certain aspects of the Company’s information technology infrastructure. Under the IT Services Agreement, IBM provides a broad range of technology services to the Company including supporting its mainframe, midrange, network and data center operations, as well as providing disaster recovery services. The migration of the data center processing to IBM was completed in August 2012. The IT Services Agreement would have expired on June 30, 2022, but a

two

-year extension was signed in March 2015, amending the expiration date to June 30, 2024. In December 2019, the Company and IBM amended and restated the IT Services Agreement (the “Amended IT Services Agreement”), which now expires on June 30, 2027. The Company has the option of incorporating additional services into the Amended IT Services Agreement over time. The Company may renew the term of the Amended IT Services Agreement for up to

one

additional


-month period. Fixed minimum commitments remaining under the Amended IT Services Agreement at June 30, 2020 are $

251.7

million through fiscal year 2027, the final year of the Amended IT Services Agreement.

In December 2019, the Company and IBM entered into an information technology agreement for private cloud services (the “IBM Private Cloud Agreement”) under which IBM will operate, manage and support the Company’s private cloud global distributed platforms and products, and operate and manage certain Company networks. The IBM Private Cloud Agreement has an initial term of approximately 10 years and three months, expiring on March 31, 2030.

As a result of the IBM Private Cloud Agreement, the Company transferred certain of its employees in April 2020 to IBM and its affiliates, and such transferred employees are expected to continue providing services to the Company on behalf of IBM under the IBM Private Cloud Agreement. Pursuant to the IBM Private Cloud Agreement, the Company has agreed to transfer the ownership of certain Company-owned hardware (the “Hardware”) located at Company facilities worldwide along with the Company’s maintenance agreements (“Maintenance Contracts”) associated with the Hardware to IBM. The transfer of the Hardware and Maintenance Contracts to IBM is expected to close no later than September 30, 2020. The Company concluded that the Hardware qualifies as assets held for sale since the Company has committed to a plan of disposal expected to be completed within a year, and therefore, has recorded the Hardware at fair value less costs to dispose based on the expected selling price to IBM (a Level 3 fair value measurement as defined in Note 7, “Fair Value of Financial Instruments”). Accordingly, the Company has recorded a non-cash pre-tax charge of $

30.4

million for the year ended June 30, 2020, equal to the difference between the Hardware’s carrying value and estimated fair value less costs to dispose, included as part of Cost of revenues on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Earnings and is included in Other for purposes of the Company's segment reporting. As of June 30, 2020, the Hardware classified as assets held for sale has a carrying amount of $

18.0

million and is included in the Company’s Other current assets line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Fixed minimum commitments remaining under the IBM Private Cloud Agreement at June 30, 2020 are

$

236.7

million

through March 31, 2030, the final year of the contract.

In March 2014, the Company and IBM United Kingdom Limited (“IBM UK”) entered into an Information Technology Services Agreement (the “EU IT Services Agreement”), under which IBM UK provides data center services supporting the Company’s technology outsourcing services for certain clients in Europe and Asia. The EU IT Services Agreement would have expired in October 2023. In December 2019, the Company amended the existing EU IT Services Agreement whereby the Company will migrate from the existing dedicated on-premise solution to a managed Broadridge private cloud environment provided by IBM, as well as extended the term of the EU IT Services Agreement to June 2029 (the “Amended EU IT Services Agreement”). The Company has the right to renew the term of the Amended EU IT Services Agreement for up to

one

additional


-month term or

one

additional


-month term. Fixed minimum commitments remaining under the Amended EU IT Services Agreement at June 30, 2020 are $

23.9

million through fiscal year 2029, the final year of the contract.

The total annual expenses related to these IBM agreements was $

118.7

million, $

106.1

million, and $

107.5

million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.


The following table summarizes the capitalized costs related to data center agreements as of June 30, 2020:

The following table summarizes the total expenses related to these agreements:

The minimum commitments at June 30, 2020 for the aforementioned Amended IT Services Agreement, the Amended EU IT Services Agreement, the IBM Private Cloud Agreement, software license agreements including hosted software arrangements, and software and hardware maintenance and support agreements are as follows:


Other

In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to various claims and litigation. While the outcome of any claim or litigation is inherently unpredictable, the Company believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

It is not the Company’s business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. However, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The Company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. The Company was not a party to any derivative financial instruments as of June 30, 2020 and 2019.

In the normal course of business, the Company also enters into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the Company’s products and services. The Company does not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties, or collateral arrangements.

The Company’s business process outsourcing and mutual fund processing services are performed by Broadridge Business Process Outsourcing, LLC (“BBPO”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, which is a broker-dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”). Although BBPO’s FINRA membership agreement allows it to engage in clearing and the retailing of corporate securities in addition to mutual fund retailing on a wire order basis, BBPO does not clear customer transactions, process any retail business or carry customer accounts. As a registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA, BBPO is subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule 15c3-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which requires BBPO to maintain a minimum net capital amount. At June 30, 2020, BBPO was in compliance with this capital requirement.

BBPO, as a “Managing Clearing Member” of the Options Clearing Corporation (the “OCC”), is also subject to OCC Rule 309(b) with respect to the business process outsourcing services that it provides to other OCC “Managed Clearing Member” broker-dealers. OCC Rule 309(b) requires BBPO to maintain a minimum net capital amount. At June 30, 2020, BBPO was in compliance with this capital requirement.

In addition,

Matrix Trust Company (“Matrix Trust”)

, a subsidiary of the Company, is a Colorado State non-depository trust company and National Securities Clearing Corporation trust member, whose primary business is to provide cash agent, custodial and directed trustee services to institutional customers, and investment management services to collective investment trust funds. As a result, Matrix Trust is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Colorado Division of Banking and the Arizona Department of Financial Institutions, as well as the National Securities Clearing Corporation. Specific capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items, when applicable, must be met. At June 30, 2020, Matrix Trust was in compliance with its capital requirements.

NOTE 20.

FINANCIAL DATA BY SEGMENT

The Company operates in

two

reportable segments: Investor Communication Solutions and Global Technology and Operations. See Note 1, “Basis of Presentation” for a further description of the Company’s reportable segments.

The primary components of “Other” are certain gains, losses, corporate overhead expenses and non-operating expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, such as interest expense. Foreign currency exchange is a reconciling item between the actual foreign currency exchange rates and the constant foreign currency exchange rates used for internal management reporting.

Certain corporate expenses, as well as certain centrally managed expenses, are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner. Because the Company compensates the management of its various businesses on, among other factors, segment profit, the Company may elect to record certain segment-related operating and non-operating expense items in Other rather than reflect such items in segment profit.

In connection with an organizational change made in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, in order to further align our portfolio of services, the results for the Company's wealth management Advisor Solutions services that were previously reported in our Investor Communication Solutions reportable segment are now reported within the Global Technology and Operations reportable segment. As a result, our prior period segment results have been revised to reflect this change, which resulted in transferring $

42.8

million of revenues and $

2.2

million of earnings before income taxes between reportable segments for the year ended June 30, 2019 and $

46.3

ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures

Management Report

Attached as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this Form 10-K are certifications of Broadridge’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, which are required by Rule 13a-14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). This “Controls and Procedures” section should be read in conjunction with the Deloitte & Touche LLP audit and attestation of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that appears in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as of June 30, 2020, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2020 were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

It is the responsibility of Broadridge’s management to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to Broadridge’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation of reliable financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Broadridge’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Broadridge; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of Broadridge are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of Broadridge; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Broadridge’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements of Broadridge.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Management has performed an assessment of the effectiveness of Broadridge’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020 based upon criteria set forth in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management determined that Broadridge’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2020.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and has expressed an unqualified opinion in their report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
