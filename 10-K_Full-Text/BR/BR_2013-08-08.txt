ITEM 1.

Business

Overview

Broadridge is a leading global provider of investor communications and technology-driven solutions to banks, broker-dealers, mutual funds
and corporate issuers. Our systems and services include investor communication solutions, and securities processing and business process outsourcing services. In short, we provide the infrastructure that helps the financial services industry
operate. With over 50 years of experience, we provide financial services firms with advanced, dependable, scalable and cost-effective integrated systems. Our systems help reduce the need for clients to make significant capital investments in
operations infrastructure, thereby allowing them to increase their focus on core business activities.

We deliver a broad
range of solutions that help our clients better serve their retail and institutional customers across the entire investment lifecycle, including pre-trade, trade, and post-trade processing. We serve a large and diverse client base across our four
businesses: Bank/Broker-Dealer Communications, Mutual Fund and Retirement Solutions, Corporate Issuer Solutions, and Bank/Broker-Dealer Technology and Operations. Our businesses operate in two business segments: Investor Communication Solutions
and Securities Processing Solutions.

Investor Communication Solutions

Our Bank/Broker-Dealer Communications, Mutual Fund and Retirement Solutions and Corporate Issuer Solutions businesses
operate within this segment. A large portion of our Investor Communication Solutions business involves the processing and distribution of proxy materials to investors in equity securities and mutual funds, as well as the facilitation of related vote
processing. ProxyEdge

®

, our innovative electronic proxy delivery and voting solution for institutional investors
and financial advisors, helps ensure the participation of the largest stockholders of many companies. We also provide the distribution of regulatory reports and corporate action/reorganization event information, as well as tax reporting solutions
that help our clients meet their regulatory compliance needs. In addition, we provide financial information distribution and transaction reporting services to both financial institutions and securities issuers. These services include the processing
and distribution of account statements and trade confirmations, traditional and personalized document fulfillment and content management services, marketing communications, and imaging, archival and workflow solutions that enable and enhance our
clients’ communications with investors. All of these communications are delivered through paper or electronic channels. In addition, Broadridge provides corporate issuers with registered proxy services as well as registrar, stock transfer and
record-keeping services.

•

Bank/Broker-Dealer Communications

: Broadridge is the leader in corporate governance activities, processing approximately 85% of the outstanding
shares in the United States (“U.S.”), and approximately 72% of the shares voted outside the U.S. in the performance of our proxy services. We process approximately two billion investor communications annually through a combination of
physical and electronic channels.

•

Mutual Fund and Retirement Solutions

: Broadridge is the leading independent provider of retirement fund processing and provides unique
data-driven market intelligence, specialized marketing communications and fund governance.

•

Corporate Issuer Solutions

: Broadridge serves corporate issuers with a variety of their needs including proxy and transfer agency services, both
domestically and globally.

Securities Processing Solutions

Our Bank/Broker-Dealer Technology and Operations business operates within this segment. We offer a suite of advanced computerized
real-time transaction processing services that automate the securities transaction lifecycle, from desktop productivity tools, data aggregation, performance reporting, and portfolio management to



order capture and execution, trade confirmation, settlement, and accounting. Our services help financial institutions efficiently and cost-effectively consolidate their books and records, gather
and service assets under management, focus on their core businesses, and manage risk. With multi-currency capabilities, our Global Processing Solution supports real-time global trading of equity, option, mutual fund, and fixed income securities in
established and emerging markets. In addition, our business process outsourcing services allow broker-dealers to outsource certain administrative functions relating to clearing and settlement, from order entry to trade matching and settlement, while
maintaining their ability to finance and capitalize their businesses.

•

Bank/Broker-Dealer Technology and Operations

: Broadridge is the leading back- and middle-office securities processing platform for North
American and global broker-dealers. Provided on an application service provider (“ASP”) basis, Broadridge’s platform is a global market solution, clearing and settling in over 50 countries. Broadridge processes on average
over $5 trillion in equity and fixed income trades per day of U.S. and Canadian securities, including approximately 60% of U.S. fixed income trades.

History and Development of Our Company

We are the former Brokerage
Services division of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (“ADP”). Broadridge was incorporated in Delaware as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ADP on March 29, 2007 in anticipation of our spin-off from ADP. Six years ago, we spun off from ADP
and began operating as an independent public company on March 30, 2007. Our company has over 50 years of history in providing innovative solutions to financial services firms and publicly-held companies. In 1962, the Brokerage Services division
of ADP opened for business with one client, processing an average of 300 trades per night. In 1979, we expanded our U.S.-based securities processing solutions to process Canadian securities.

We made significant additions to our Securities Processing Solutions business through two key acquisitions in the mid-1990s. In 1995, we
acquired a London-based provider of multi-currency clearance and settlement services, to become a global supplier of transaction processing services. In 1996, we acquired a provider of institutional fixed income transaction processing systems.

We began offering our proxy services in 1989. The proxy services business, which started what has become our Investor
Communication Solutions business, leveraged the information processing systems and infrastructure of our Securities Processing Solutions business. Our proxy services offering attracted 31 major clients in its first year of operations. In 1992, we
acquired The Independent Election Corporation of America which further increased our proxy services capabilities. By 1999, we were handling over 90% of the investor communication distributions for securities held of record by banks and
broker-dealers in the U.S.—from proxy statements to annual reports. During the 1990s, we expanded our proxy services business to serve security owners of Canadian and United Kingdom issuers and we began offering a complete outsourced solution
for international proxies.

In 1994, we began offering ProxyEdge, our innovative electronic proxy
delivery and voting solution for institutional investors that helps ensure the participation of the largest stockholders of many companies. In 1998, having previously provided print and distribution services as an accommodation to our securities
processing and proxy clients, we decided to focus on account statement and reporting services. In 2001, we developed and released PostEdge

®

to meet the need for electronic distribution and archiving of all investor communications.

Three years ago, Broadridge entered the transfer agency business through its acquisition of a provider of registrar,
stock transfer and record-keeping services. In fiscal year 2011, the Company acquired three businesses in the Investor Communication Solutions segment. In August 2010, the Company acquired NewRiver, Inc. (“NewRiver

®

”), a leader in mutual fund electronic investor disclosure solutions. In December 2010, the Company acquired
Forefield, Inc. (“Forefield

®

”), a leading provider of real-time sales, education and client
communication solutions for financial institutions and their advisors. In January 2011, the Company acquired Matrix Financial Solutions, Inc. (“Matrix

®

”). Matrix is a provider of mutual fund processing services for third party administrators, financial advisors, banks and wealth management professionals.
Matrix’s back-office, trust,



custody, trading and mutual fund settlement services are integrated into our product suite thereby strengthening Broadridge’s role as a provider of data processing and distribution channel
solutions to the mutual fund industry.

The Company has also acquired businesses in the Securities
Processing Solutions segment. In fiscal year 2010, the Company acquired City Networks Ltd (“City
Networks

®

”), a leading software and services provider of reconciliation, multi-asset process automation and
operational risk management solutions to the global financial services industry. In fiscal year 2012, the Company acquired Paladyne Systems, Inc. (“Paladyne

®

”), a provider of buy-side technology solutions for the global investment management industry.

The Broadridge Business

Investor Communication Solutions

A majority of publicly-traded shares are not registered in companies’ records in the names of their ultimate beneficial owners.
Instead, a substantial majority of all public companies’ shares are held in “street name,” meaning that they are held of record by broker-dealers or banks through their depositories. Most street name shares are registered in the name
“Cede & Co.,” the name used by The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”), which holds shares on behalf of its participant broker-dealers and banks. These participant broker-dealers and banks (which are known
as nominees because they hold securities in name only) in turn hold the shares on behalf of their clients, the individual beneficial owners. Nominees, upon request, are required to provide companies with lists of beneficial owners who do not object
to having their names, addresses, and share holdings supplied to companies, so called “non-objecting beneficial owners” (or “NOBOs”). Objecting beneficial owners (or “OBOs”) may be contacted directly only by the
broker-dealer or bank.

Because DTCC’s role is only that of custodian, a number of mechanisms have been developed in
order to pass the legal rights it holds as the record owner (such as the right to vote) to the beneficial owners. The first step in passing voting rights down the chain is the “omnibus proxy,” which DTCC executes to transfer its voting
rights to its participant nominees.

Under applicable rules, nominees must deliver proxy materials to beneficial owners and
request voting instructions. Nominees are often prohibited by applicable New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), or other self-regulatory organization (“SRO”) rules, or by express agreements with their customers from voting the
securities held in their customers’ accounts in the absence of receiving such customers’ voting instructions.

A
large number of nominees have contracted out the administrative processes of distributing proxy materials and tabulating voting instructions to us. Nominees accomplish this by transferring to us via powers of attorney the authority to execute a
proxy, which authority they receive from DTCC (via omnibus proxy). We then distribute the proxy materials and voting instruction forms (known as “VIFs”) to beneficial owners.

The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (the “SEC”) rules require public companies to reimburse nominees for the expense
of distributing stockholder communications to beneficial owners of securities held in street name. The reimbursement rates are set forth in the rules of SROs, including the NYSE. We act as a billing and collection agent for many nominees with
respect to this reimbursement. We bill public companies on behalf of the nominees, collect the fee and remit to the nominee any difference between the fee that the nominee is entitled to collect and the amount that the nominee has agreed to pay us
for our services. In addition, the NYSE rules establish fees specifically for the services provided by intermediaries in the proxy process such as Broadridge.

We also compile NOBO lists on behalf of nominees in response to requests from issuers. The preparation of NOBO lists is subject to reimbursement by the securities issuers requesting such lists to the
broker-dealers. The reimbursement rates are based on the number of NOBOs on the list produced pursuant to NYSE or other SRO rules. Such rules also provide for certain fees to be paid to third party intermediaries who compile such NOBO lists. We
function as such an intermediary in the NOBO process.



We also provide proxy distribution, vote tabulation, and various additional investor
communication tools and services to institutional investors, corporate issuers, and investment companies.

The services we
provide in this segment represented approximately 73%, 71%, and 72% of our total Revenues in fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. These services include the following:

Bank and Brokerage Offerings

. We handle the entire proxy materials distribution and voting process for our bank and
broker-dealer clients on-line and in real-time, from coordination with third-party entities to ordering, inventory maintenance, mailing, tracking and vote tabulation. We offer electronic proxy delivery services for the electronic delivery of proxy
materials to investors and collection of consents; maintenance of a database that contains the delivery method preferences of our clients’ customers; posting of documents on the Internet; e-mail notification to investors notifying them that
proxy materials are available; and proxy voting over the Internet, mobile devices and tablets. We also have the ability to combine stockholder communications for multiple stockholders residing at the same address which we accomplish by having
ascertained the delivery preferences of investors. In addition, we provide a complete outsourced solution for the processing of international proxies. We also provide a complete reorganization communications solution to notify investors of
reorganizations or corporate action events such as tender offers, mergers and acquisitions, bankruptcies, and class action lawsuits.

We also offer our bank and brokerage clients financial information distribution and transaction reporting services to help them meet their regulatory compliance requirements and business needs including:
prospectus fulfillment services; electronic prospectus services; PostEdge, our electronic document archival and electronic delivery solution for documents including trade confirmations, tax documents and account statements; marketing communications;
imaging, archival and workflow solutions; and on-demand digital print services. In addition, we offer our Mailbox products—Advisor Mailbox

TM

and Investor Mailbox

®

—which provide a holistic network environment that supports and complements any investor communication strategy. Advisor Mailbox is the latest complement to our
Investor Mailbox solution, our service providing the electronic delivery of investor communications to our clients’ websites, creating investor access to regulatory delivery notices, day-to-day account and investment information and convenient
response tools. Our Advisor Mailbox is an electronic communications platform for financial advisors that delivers immediate electronic access to the communications and documents sent to such advisors’ customers. Advisor Mailbox streamlines
multiple communication paths for all investor-related documents into a single-visit portal that is integrated onto an advisor’s platform.

We also provide tax services to financial services firms that support their various information year-end reporting (e.g., Forms 1099) and withholding requirements, with a focus on securities and fund
processing/clearance operations. Our tax data services provide tax content and data management, including securities tax classifications and reclassifications, calculations of original issue discount and other accrual and cost basis adjusting
events. Our tax managed services provide technology and personnel outsourcing, withholding services and client reporting, including print/electronic distribution and archival.

In fiscal year 2011, the Company acquired NewRiver, a leader in mutual fund electronic investor disclosure solutions. NewRiver has
provided the Company with important capabilities for the broker-dealer and retirement and annuity markets. Specifically, its proprietary extraction, normalization and presentment capabilities from the SEC’s EDGAR database have enabled us
to enhance our prospectus post-sale fulfillment operations by moving to an on-demand solution. This process provides efficiency for our clients as it reduces their reliance on offset print and fund delivered inventory. Broadridge has also been
able to leverage the intellectual property in this business to provide portfolio-specific solutions for the retirement and annuity markets. Through our integration of this functionality into our existing capabilities, we offer a new and
efficient fulfillment model for regulatory and compliance mailings.

The Company also acquired Forefield in fiscal year 2011,
a leading provider of real-time sales, education and client communication solutions for financial institutions and their advisors. Forefield has expanded its services portfolio to leverage its industry leading financial content for use by financial
services firms in their social media content libraries. Forefield also provides an advisor website product that can be populated with



Forefield’s content or content created by the advisor. Forefield continues to develop new applications that further the goal of creating timely, accurate and meaningful communications for
both advisors and their clients. For example, Forefield’s

Women’s Resource Center

, which contains a broad selection of content for both the advisor and their client, focuses specifically on the requirements and challenges faced by
women investors.

Institutional Investor Offerings

.

We provide a suite of services to manage the entire
proxy voting process of institutional investors, including fulfilling their fiduciary obligations and meeting their reporting needs such as ProxyEdge, our workflow solution that integrates ballots for positions held across multiple custodians and
presents them under a single proxy. Voting can be instructed for the entire position, by account vote group or on an individual account basis either manually or automatically based on the recommendations of participating governance research
providers. ProxyEdge also provides for client reporting and regulatory reporting. ProxyEdge can be utilized for meetings of U.S. and Canadian companies and for meetings in many non-North American countries based on the holdings of our global
custodian clients. ProxyEdge is offered in several languages and there are currently 4,500 ProxyEdge users worldwide.

Corporate Issuer Offerings

.

We are the largest processor and provider of investor communication solutions to public companies. We offer our corporate issuer clients many tools to
facilitate their communications with investors such as Internet and telephone proxy voting, electronic delivery of corporate filings, and householding of communications to stockholders at the same address. One of our opportunities for growth in the
Investor Communication Solutions segment involves serving corporate issuer clients in providing communications services to registered stockholders—that is, stockholders who do not hold their shares through a broker-dealer in street name. We
also offer proxy services to non-North American corporate issuers in connection with their general and special meetings of stockholders. Our corporate issuer services include ShareLink

®

, which provides complete project management for the beneficial and registered proxy process.

We also provide registrar, stock transfer and record-keeping services. Our strategy in the transfer agency business is to address the needs public companies have expressed for lower cost, more reliable
stockholder record maintenance and communication services. We intend to accomplish this by leveraging our existing investor communications and securities processing capabilities to enable us to deliver enhanced transfer agency services to corporate
issuers. In addition, we can offer issuers and their shareholders the ability to migrate their shareholders’ holdings from registered to beneficial ownership, thereby creating efficiencies for issuers and greater convenience for their
shareholders.

Our Shareholder Forum

TM

solution is an online venue that offers public companies the ability to host structured, controlled communication with
their shareholders on a timely and regular basis. Validated shareholders can submit questions, answer surveys in preparation of the annual meeting and year-round, and communicate in various ways with a corporation. Our Virtual Shareholder
Meeting

TM

service provides corporate issuers in a number
of states with the ability to host their annual meeting electronically on the Internet, either on a stand-alone basis, or in conjunction with their physical annual meeting. As the entity that provides beneficial shareholder proxy processing on
behalf of many banks and brokerage firms, we can provide shareholder validation and voting to companies that want to hold virtual meetings.

Mutual Fund Offerings

.

We provide a full range of tools that enable mutual funds to communicate with large audiences of investors efficiently, reliably, and often with substantial
cost savings. Our solutions allow mutual funds to centralize all investor communications through one resource. We also provide printing and mailing of regulatory reports, prospectuses and proxy materials, as well as proxy solicitation services. In
addition, we distribute marketing communications and informational materials and create on-demand enrollment materials for mutual fund investors. Our position in the industry enables us to manage the entire communication process with both registered
and beneficial stockholders. Our Access Data SalesVision

®

platform provides comprehensive data aggregation and
data management solutions. SalesVision is software delivered as a service and assists mutual funds in processing commission and distribution payments, monitoring their compliance with regulatory requirements, and assembling shareholder and
intermediary data in a form to better drive their sales strategy and marketing programs.



In addition, we provide mutual fund processing services for third party administrators,
financial advisors, banks and wealth management professionals through our subsidiary Matrix, which was acquired in fiscal year 2011. Our back-office, trust, custody, trading and mutual fund settlement services are integrated into our product suite,
thereby strengthening our role as a provider of data processing and distribution channel solutions to the mutual fund industry.

Securities Processing Solutions

Transactions involving securities and other financial market instruments originate with an investor, who places an order with a broker who in turn routes that order to an appropriate market for execution.
At that point, the parties to the transaction coordinate payment and settlement of the transaction through a clearinghouse. The records of the parties involved must then be updated to reflect completion of the transaction. Tax, custody, accounting
and record-keeping requirements must be complied with in connection with the transaction and the customer’s account information must correctly reflect the transaction. The accurate processing of trading activity and custody activity requires
effective automation and information flow across multiple systems and functions within the brokerage firm and across the systems of the various parties that participate in the execution of a transaction.

Our securities processing solutions automate the transaction lifecycle of equity, mutual fund, fixed income, and option securities
trading operations, from order capture and execution through trade confirmation, settlement, custody and accounting. Our services facilitate the automation of straight-through-processing operations and enable financial institutions to efficiently
and cost-effectively consolidate their books and records, gather and service assets under management, focus on their core businesses, and manage risk. With our multi-currency capabilities, we support trading activities on a global basis.

In September 2011, we acquired Paladyne, a provider of buy-side technology solutions for the global investment management industry.
Paladyne provides front-, middle-, and back-office solutions such as Order Management, Data Warehousing, Reporting and Portfolio Accounting to hedge funds, investment managers and the providers that service this space (prime brokers, hedge fund
administrators and custodians). The scope of Paladyne’s client base includes start-up or emerging managers through some of the largest global hedge fund complexes and global administrators. We have integrated our business process
outsourcing expertise with the Paladyne technology solutions to offer a set of managed services to the buy-side of the industry. Paladyne has enhanced the asset classes we service and expanded our global footprint and market coverage.

In March 2010, we entered into an Information Technology Services Agreement (the “IT Services Agreement”) with
International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”), under which IBM provides certain aspects of our information technology infrastructure. The migration of our data center processing from ADP to IBM was completed in August 2012.

Our securities processing services represented approximately 27%, 29%, and 28% of our total Revenues in fiscal years 2013,
2012, and 2011, respectively. These services include the following:

North American Processing Services

.

We provide a set of sophisticated, multi-currency systems that support real-time processing of securities transactions in North American equities, options, fixed income securities, and mutual funds. Brokerage Processing Services
(“BPS”) is our core multi-currency back-office processing system that supports real-time processing of transactions in the U.S. markets. BPS handles everything from order management to clearance/settlement and custody, and assists our
clients in meeting their regulatory reporting and other back-office requirements. BPS is provided on a hosted ASP basis. We also offer a version of BPS for processing Canadian securities. In addition to our BPS offering, we provide specialized
transaction processing tools and services for small to mid-market financial firms in Canada. We also provide state-of-the-art fixed income transaction processing capabilities and support for front-, middle-, and back-office functions. Our securities
processing services can be integrated with our web-based desktop applications, wealth management tools, enterprise workflow, automated inquiry reporting and record-keeping services.



International Processing Services

.

We provide advanced multi-currency
transaction processing solutions for institutional and retail securities operations, corporate actions, and business process outsourcing services such as data cleansing. Our Global Processing Solution is our integrated delivery of multiple
securities processing products and services to create a comprehensive system that is capable of processing transactions in equity, option, mutual fund, and fixed income securities in established and emerging markets, at any time. Its advanced
real-time processes automate the securities transaction lifecycle from order capture and execution through confirmation, settlement, and accounting.

Business Process Outsourcing Services

.

We also provide business process outsourcing services relating to a variety of securities clearing, record-keeping, and custody-related
functions. Our clients execute and clear their securities transactions and engage us to perform a number of related administrative back-office functions, such as record-keeping and reconciliations. In this capacity, we are not the broker-dealer of
record.

Broadridge’s Integrated Solutions

Our core systems for processing equity, option, and mutual fund transactions in the U.S. markets can also be combined with our specialized systems for processing fixed income and international securities
transactions. These specialized securities processing services can be fully integrated with business process outsourcing services. In addition, our clients can integrate our securities processing and business process outsourcing services with our
other services including: (i) the processing of trade confirmations and account statements, delivered in paper or electronically; (ii) equity and mutual fund prospectus processing; (iii) automated workflow tools that help our clients
streamline their securities processing and operations activities; and (iv) a full suite of wealth management products including data aggregation tools, end-customer websites, broker desktop, financial planning and modeling tools, performance
reporting and portfolio accounting.

Clients

We serve a large and diverse client base in the financial services industry including retail and institutional brokerage firms, global banks, mutual funds, annuity companies, institutional investors,
specialty trading firms, clearing firms, third party administrators, and hedge funds. We also provide services to corporate issuers.

In fiscal year 2013, we:

•

processed approximately 85% of the outstanding shares in the U.S. in the performance of our proxy services;

•

processed approximately two billion investor communications through either paper or electronic channels;

•

processed on average over $5 trillion in equity and fixed income trades per day of U.S. and Canadian securities, including approximately 60% of U.S.
fixed income trades; and

•

provided fixed income trade processing services to 15 of the 21 primary dealers of fixed income securities in the U.S.

In fiscal year 2013, we derived approximately 25% of our consolidated revenues from five clients. Our largest single client accounted for
approximately 6% of our consolidated revenues.

Competition

We operate in a highly competitive industry. Our Investor Communication Solutions business competes with companies that provide investor communication and corporate governance solutions including transfer
agents who handle communication services to registered (non-beneficial) securities holders, proxy advisory firms, proxy solicitation firms and other proxy services providers. We also face competition from numerous firms in the compiling and printing
of transaction confirmations and account statements. Our Securities



Processing Solutions business principally competes with brokerage firms that perform their trade processing in-house, and with numerous other outsourcing vendors. Our back-office support services
offered through this segment also compete with very large financial institutions that manage their own back-office record-keeping operations. In many cases, clients engage us only to perform certain functions, such as back-office processing, and do
not outsource their other functions such as clearing operations support that we would also perform for them.

Technology

We have several information processing systems which serve as the core foundation of our technology platform. We leverage these systems in
order to provide our services. We are committed to maintaining extremely high levels of quality service through our skilled technical employees and the use of our technology within an environment that seeks continual improvement.

Our mission-critical applications are designed to provide high levels of availability, scalability, reliability, and flexibility. They
operate on industry standard enterprise architecture platforms that provide high degrees of horizontal and vertical scaling. This scalability and redundancy allows us to provide high degrees of system availability. In March 2010, we entered into the
IT Services Agreement with IBM, under which IBM performs a broad range of technology services including supporting our mainframe, midrange, open systems, network and data center operations, as well as providing disaster recovery services. We have
the option of incorporating additional services into the agreement over time. The IT Services Agreement expires on June 30, 2022. We have the right to renew it for up to an additional 12-month term. Our principal data center systems and
applications had previously been operated and managed by ADP. The migration of our data center processing from ADP to IBM was completed in August 2012.

We have the right to terminate the IT Services Agreement for several reasons including for cause, for convenience, or in the event of a change of ownership control of IBM. However, several of the grounds
for termination of the IT Services Agreement by Broadridge require us to pay a termination fee to IBM. IBM also has certain termination rights in the event of a material breach of the Company’s obligations under the IT Services Agreement and
its failure to cure.

Most of our systems and applications process in Tier III+ and Tier IV data centers. Tier III+ and Tier
IV data centers employ multiple active power and cooling distribution paths, redundant components, and are capable of providing 99.995% availability. Tier III+ and Tier IV data centers provide infrastructure capacity and capability to permit any
planned activity without disruption to the critical load, and can sustain at least one worst-case, unplanned failure or event with no critical load impact. Our geographically dispersed processing centers also provide disaster recovery and business
continuity processing.

To further demonstrate our commitment to maintaining the highest levels of quality service and client
satisfaction within an environment that fosters continual improvement, our data centers are International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 9001:2000 certified. In addition, Broadridge’s core applications and
facilities for the provision of our proxy, U.S. equity and fixed income securities processing services, and IBM’s data centers are ISO 27001 certified. This security standard specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing,
operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and improving a documented Information Security Management System within the context of the organization’s overall business risks. It specifies the requirements for the implementation of security
controls customized to the needs of individual organizations. This standard addresses confidentiality, access control, vulnerability, business continuity, and risk assessment.

Product Development.

Our products and services are designed with reliability, availability, scalability, and flexibility so that we can fully meet our clients’ processing needs. These
applications are built in a manner which allows us to meet the breadth and depth of requirements of our financial services industry clients in a highly efficient manner. We continually upgrade, enhance, and expand our existing products and services
taking into account input from clients, industry-wide initiatives and regulatory changes affecting our clients.



Intellectual Property.

We own registered marks for our trade name and own or
have applied for trademark registrations for many of our services and products. We regard our products and services as proprietary and utilize internal security practices and confidentiality restrictions in contracts with employees, clients, and
others for protection. We believe that we hold all proprietary rights necessary to conduct our business.

Employees

At June 30, 2013, we had approximately 6,400 employees. None of our employees is subject to collective bargaining agreements
governing their employment with our company. We believe that our employee relations are good.

Regulation

The securities and financial services industries are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions. As a matter
of public policy, regulatory bodies in the U.S. and the rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of investors participating in those markets.

In the U.S., the securities and financial services industries are subject to regulation under both federal and state laws. At
the federal level, the SEC regulates the securities industry, along with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”), the various stock exchanges, and other SROs. Our Investor Communication Solutions and Securities
Processing Solutions businesses are generally not directly subject to federal, state, or foreign laws and regulations that are specifically applicable to financial institutions. However, as a provider of services to financial institutions and
issuers of securities, our services are provided in a manner to assist our clients in complying with the laws and regulations to which they are subject, such as our proxy distribution, processing, and voting services. As a result, the services we
provide may change as applicable SEC, FINRA and SRO regulations are revised. For example, in 2007 the SEC amended the proxy rules to allow public companies to follow a “notice and access” model of proxy material delivery. The SEC’s
notice and access rules caused us to develop and offer a number of new and additional services.

On July 14, 2010, the
SEC voted unanimously to issue for public comment a concept release (the “Concept Release”) focusing on a wide range of topics related to the U.S. proxy system. The Concept Release was organized by the three general topics on which the SEC
sought public input: (1) ensuring the accuracy, transparency, and efficiency of the voting process, (2) enhancing shareholder communication and participation, and (3) addressing the relationship between voting power and economic
interest. The comment period on the Concept Release ended in 2010. The SEC may, but is not necessarily required to, engage in rulemaking with respect to the topics addressed by the Concept Release. In September 2010, the NYSE formed the Proxy Fee
Advisory Committee made up of issuers, broker-dealers and investors to review the NYSE proxy distribution fees. In May 2012, the Proxy Fee Advisory Committee issued its recommendations on the fees paid by issuers for the distribution of proxy
materials to beneficial shareholders. The proposed changes in fees are subject to SEC approval. We will monitor any future actions taken by the SEC, the SROs or other participants in the proxy process with respect to the Concept Release and the
NYSE’s fee proposal. If changes are made to the U.S. proxy system, we expect to continue to adapt our business practices and service offerings to assist our clients in fulfilling their obligations under any new or modified legal requirements
and industry practices.

Certain of our securities processing operations are periodically reviewed by the U.S. Federal
Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”) under its authority to examine financial institutions’ technology service providers. Examinations by the FFIEC cover areas such as data integrity and data security. A sufficiently
unfavorable review from the FFIEC could result in our clients not being allowed to use our services.

Our business process
outsourcing and mutual fund processing services are performed by a registered broker-dealer. As a registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA, it is subject to regulations concerning many aspects of its business, including trade practices, capital
requirements, record retention, money laundering prevention, the



protection of customer funds and customer securities, and the supervision of the conduct of directors, officers and employees. A failure to comply with any of these laws, rules or regulations
could result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, or the suspension or revocation of SEC or FINRA authorization granted to allow the operation of its business or disqualification of its directors, officers or employees. In
addition, as a registered broker-dealer, it is required to participate in the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”) for the benefit of customers. In addition, MG Trust Company, LLC (“MG Trust Company

®

”), a subsidiary of Matrix, is a Colorado State non-depository trust company whose primary business is to
provide cash agent, custodial and directed or non-discretionary trust services to institutional customers. MG Trust Company operates pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Colorado Division of Banking.

In addition, our business process outsourcing services are subject to regulatory oversight by the SEC and FINRA. The recent economic
turmoil has resulted in increased regulatory scrutiny of the securities industry including the outsourcing of regulatory functions. This oversight could result in the future enactment of more restrictive laws or rules with respect to business
process outsourcing. We will monitor any future actions taken by the SEC and FINRA, and if new requirements are enacted, we expect to adapt our business practices and service offerings to assist our clients in fulfilling their obligations under any
new or modified legal requirements and industry practices. In addition, if we expand our business process outsourcing services into other countries in the future, we will be required to comply with the regulatory controls of each country in which we
conduct business.

Our transfer agency business, Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc., is subject to certain rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC, including without limitation, with respect to registration with the SEC, annual reporting, examination, internal controls, proper disposal of shareholder information and obligations relating to its
operations. Our transfer agency business has been formally approved by the NYSE to act as a transfer agent or registrar for issuers of NYSE listed securities and is subject to certain NYSE requirements concerning operational
standards. Furthermore, it is also subject to U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and postal regulations, as well as certain provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Federal Trade Commission’s regulations with
respect to maintenance of information security safeguards.

Privacy and Information Security Regulations

The processing of personal information is required to provide our services. Data privacy laws and regulations in the U.S. and foreign
countries apply to the collection, transfer, use, storage, and destruction of personal information. In the U.S., the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which applies to financial institutions, applies to certain aspects of our business process
outsourcing services, mutual fund processing and transfer agency businesses and to the services that involve data processing for financial institutions, and applies indirectly to our other businesses through contractual commitments with our clients
and through industry standards. In addition, state privacy and information security laws, and consumer protection laws, which apply to businesses that collect or process personal information, also apply directly to our businesses. These laws may
require notification to affected individuals, state officers, and consumer reporting agencies in the event of a security breach that results in unauthorized access to or disclosure of certain non-public personal information. These regulations and
laws also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through internal policies and procedures.

Similar data
privacy laws related to the collection, transfer, use, and storage of personal information exist outside of the U.S., such as the European Union’s 95/46 EC Directive of the European Parliament, Canada’s Personal Information Protection and
Electronic Documents Act, individual European national laws, and data privacy laws of other countries. In some cases, these laws may be more restrictive and may require different compliance requirements than the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the U.S.
state privacy laws or consumer protection laws, and may impose additional duties on companies.

There has been increased
public attention regarding the corporate use of personal information, accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection, information security and consumer privacy.



The law in these areas is not consistent or settled. While we believe that Broadridge is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities, the legal, political, and business environments in these
areas are rapidly changing, and subsequent legislation, regulation, litigation, court rulings, or other events could expose Broadridge to increased program costs, liability, and possible damage to our reputation.

Other

Our
businesses, both directly and indirectly, rely on the Internet and other electronic communications gateways. We intend to expand our use of these gateways. To date, the use of the Internet has been relatively free from regulatory restraints.
However, governmental agencies within the U.S. and other jurisdictions are beginning to address regulatory issues that may arise in connection with the use of the Internet. Accordingly, new regulations or interpretations may be adopted that
constrain our own and our clients’ abilities to transact business through the Internet or other electronic communications gateways.

Seasonality

Processing
and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors in equity securities and mutual funds comprises a large portion of our Investor Communication Solutions business. We process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and
annual reports during our fourth fiscal quarter (the second quarter of the calendar year). The recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies and mutual funds.
Historically, this has caused our revenues, operating income, net earnings, and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other quarter. The seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate
future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows on a fiscal quarter-by-quarter basis.

ITEM 1A.

Risk Factors

You should
carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated by reference herein. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the following
information identifies the material risk factors affecting our company. However, additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.



If any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, they could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

Consolidation in the financial services
industry could adversely affect our revenues by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and could make us increasingly dependent on a more limited number of clients.

There has been and continues to be merger, acquisition, and consolidation activity in the financial services industry. In recent years,
the economic slowdown and in particular, its impact on the financial services industry, resulted in increased mergers or consolidations of our clients. Mergers or consolidations of financial institutions could reduce the number of our clients and
potential clients. If our clients merge with or are acquired by other firms that are not our clients, or firms that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce the use of our services. In addition, it is possible that the larger
financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations could decide to perform in-house some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business
and results of operations.

A large percentage of our revenues are derived from a small number of clients in the financial services
industry.

In fiscal year 2013, we derived approximately 25% of our consolidated revenues from our five largest clients
and approximately 60% of the revenues of our Securities Processing Solutions segment from the 15 largest clients in that segment. Our largest single client accounted for approximately 6% of our consolidated revenues. While these clients generally
work with multiple business segments, the loss of business from any of these clients due to merger or consolidation, financial difficulties or bankruptcy, or the termination or non-renewal of contracts would have a material adverse effect on our
revenues and results of operations. Also, in the event a client experiences financial difficulties or bankruptcy resulting in a reduction in their demand for our services or loss of the client’s business, in addition to losing the revenue from
that client, the Company would be required to write-off any investments made by the Company in connection with that client. Under a number of our contracts, our clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us and to consider
whether to renew their contracts or engage one of our competitors to provide services. If we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates with favorable terms, particularly with these clients, our revenues from such renewals and the associated
earnings could be negatively impacted. In addition, the current economic slowdown and its specific impact on the financial services industry, has resulted in increased pricing pressure, particularly with respect to our Securities Processing
Solutions business.

The financial services industry has experienced increasing scrutiny by regulatory authorities in recent years and
further changes in legislation or regulations may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or may reduce our profitability.

The legislative and regulatory environment of the financial services industry has recently undergone significant change and may undergo further change in the future. The SEC, FINRA, various stock
exchanges, and other U.S. and foreign governmental or regulatory authorities continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws and regulations. These legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely
affect the way in which we conduct our business and may make our business less profitable. Also, changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by those entities may adversely affect our business.

Our Investor Communication Solutions and Securities Processing Solutions businesses are generally not directly subject to federal, state,
or foreign laws and regulations that are specifically applicable to financial institutions. However, as a provider of services to financial institutions and issuers of securities, our services are particularly sensitive to changes in laws and
regulations governing our clients and the securities markets. In 2010, the SEC issued the Concept Release focused on a wide range of topics related to the U.S. proxy system.



The SEC may, but is not necessarily required to, engage in rulemaking with respect to the topics addressed by the Concept Release. In September 2010, the NYSE formed the Proxy Fee Advisory
Committee made up of issuers, broker-dealers and investors to review the NYSE proxy distribution fees. In May 2012, the Proxy Fee Advisory Committee issued its recommendations on the fees paid by issuers for the distribution of proxy materials to
beneficial shareholders. The proposed changes in fees are subject to SEC approval. We will monitor any future actions taken by the SEC, the SROs or other participants in the proxy process with respect to the Concept Release and the NYSE’s fee
proposal.

Certain of our securities processing operations are periodically reviewed by the FFIEC under its authority to
examine financial institutions’ technology service providers. Examinations by the FFIEC cover areas such as data integrity and data security. A sufficiently unfavorable review from the FFIEC could result in our clients not being allowed to use
our services.

In addition, our business process outsourcing, mutual fund processing and transfer agency solutions as well as
the entities providing those services are subject to regulatory oversight. Our provision of these services must comply with applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, FINRA, and various stock exchanges, state securities commissions, and other
regulatory bodies charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities markets and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors participating in these markets. If we fail to comply with any applicable regulations in
performing those services, we could lose our clients, be subject to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings, censures and fines, our reputation could be harmed and we could be limited in our ability to obtain new clients. Our
ability to comply with these regulations depends largely upon the maintenance of an effective compliance system which can be time consuming and costly, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel.

There has been increased public attention regarding the corporate use of personal information, accompanied by legislation and regulations
intended to strengthen data protection, information security and consumer privacy. The law in these areas is not consistent or settled. While we believe that Broadridge is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities, the legal, political and
business environments in these areas are rapidly changing, and subsequent legislation, regulation, litigation, court rulings or other events could expose Broadridge to increased program costs, liability, and possible damage to our reputation.

Our clients in the financial services industry are subject to increasing regulation and oversight by regulators, which could adversely
affect our ability to conduct our business or may reduce our profitability.

We provide technology solutions to a large
and diverse client base in the financial services industry including retail and institutional brokerage firms, global banks, mutual funds, annuity companies, institutional investors, specialty trading firms, independent broker-dealers, and clearing
firms. These clients are generally subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions. The current legislative and regulatory environment may impact the way that our clients do business in a way that could adversely impact us.
For example, new regulations governing our clients could result in significant expenditures that could cause them to reduce their use of our services, seek to renegotiate existing agreements, or cease or curtail their operations, all of which could
adversely impact our business. In addition, the financial services industry has experienced increased scrutiny in recent years and penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities, including the SEC, FINRA, securities exchanges, state attorneys
general and international regulators, have increased accordingly. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies, could result in fines, limitations on business activity or suspension or expulsion from the industry, any of which could have a
material adverse effect upon our clients. Adverse regulatory actions that change our clients’ businesses or adversely affect their operating results or financial condition could decrease their ability to purchase, or their demand for, our
products and services, thus causing loss of business from these clients. The loss of business from our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.



Our revenues may decrease due to declines in the levels of participation and activity in the
securities markets.

We generate significant revenues from the transaction processing fees we earn from our services.
These revenue sources are substantially dependent on the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets. The number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients and our clients’ customer trading volumes
reflect the levels of participation and activity in the markets, which are impacted by market prices, and the liquidity of the securities markets, among other factors. Over the past several years, the U.S. and foreign securities markets have
experienced significant volatility. Sudden sharp or gradual but sustained declines in market participation and activity can result in reduced investor communications activity, including reduced proxy and event-driven communications processing such
as mutual fund proxy, mergers and acquisitions and other special corporate event communications processing, and reduced trading volumes. The occurrence of any of these events would likely result in reduced revenues and decreased profitability from
our business operations.

Security breaches or cybersecurity attacks could adversely affect our ability to operate, could result in
personal information being misappropriated, and may cause us to be held liable or suffer harm to our reputation.

We
process and transfer the personal and account information of customers of financial institutions and investors in public companies and mutual funds. In certain circumstances, vendors such as our data center services provider also have access to such
information. We maintain systems and procedures including encryption, authentication technology, and transmission of data over private networks to protect against unauthorized access to electronic information and cybersecurity attacks, and we
require our vendors to have adequate security if they have access to personal information. However, despite those safeguards, it is possible that unauthorized individuals could improperly access our systems or improperly obtain or disclose the
personal information of our clients’ customers, investors in public companies and mutual funds, or our employees. It is also possible that a vendor could intentionally or inadvertently disclose such information. Any security breach resulting in
the unauthorized use or disclosure of personal information could result in interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients, or the loss of critical or sensitive information, and we could be liable to parties who are
financially harmed by those breaches. Our liability risk is anticipated in our services agreements with our clients and our insurance coverage. However, we may not be adequately protected against all possible losses through the terms of our services
agreements and our insurance coverage. In addition, we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of information security breaches or to respond to or alleviate problems caused by such breaches. Furthermore, a material security breach
could cause us to lose revenues, lose clients or cause damage to our reputation.

We purchase a significant portion of our data center
services, including disaster recovery capabilities, from a third party data center services provider, and if our data center services provider fails to adequately perform the data center services in the manner necessary to meet our clients’
needs, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be harmed.

IBM provides us with data center
services under the IT Services Agreement that include supporting our mainframe, midrange, open systems, network and data center operations, as well as disaster recovery services. As a result, we currently purchase a significant portion of our data
center services, including disaster recovery capabilities, from IBM. If IBM fails to adequately perform the data center services in the manner necessary to meet our clients’ needs, our business, financial condition and results of operations may
be harmed. Some of these risks are anticipated and covered through service level credits, termination rights, and indemnification clauses in the IT Services Agreement. However, we may not adequately be protected against all possible losses through
the terms of the IT Services Agreement.

In the event of a disaster, our disaster recovery and business continuity plans may fail, which
could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations.

Our operations are dependent on our
ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe, natural disaster, or severe weather including events resulting from unauthorized security breach, power loss,



telecommunications failure, terrorist attack, or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. We have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place
in the event of system failure due to any of these events and we test our plans regularly. In addition, our outsourced data center services provider also has disaster recovery plans and procedures in place. However, we cannot be certain that our
plans, or those of our outsourced data center services provider, will be successful in the event of a disaster. If our disaster recovery or business continuity plans are unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario, we could potentially lose client
data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients, and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures. Our liability risk is anticipated in our services agreements
with our clients and our insurance coverage. However, we may not be adequately protected against all possible losses through the terms of our services agreements and our insurance coverage. In addition, such failures could cause us to lose revenues,
lose clients or damage our reputation.

Any slowdown or failure of our computer or communications systems or those of our outsourced
data center services provider could impact our ability to provide services to our clients and support our internal operations and could subject us to liability for losses suffered by our clients or their customers.

Our services depend on our ability to store, retrieve, process, and manage significant databases, and to receive and process transactions
and investor communications through a variety of electronic systems and media. Our systems, those of our outsourced data center services provider, or any other systems with which ours interact could slow down significantly or fail for a variety of
reasons, including:

•

computer viruses or undetected errors in internal software programs or computer systems;

•

inability to rapidly monitor all system activity;

•

inability to effectively resolve any errors in internal software programs or computer systems once they are detected;

•

heavy stress placed on systems during peak times; or

•

power or telecommunications failure, fire, flood or any other disaster.

While we monitor system loads and performance and implement system upgrades to handle predicted increases in trading volume and
volatility, we cannot assure you that we will be able to predict future volume increases or volatility accurately or that our systems and those of our data center services provider will be able to accommodate these volume increases or volatility
without failure or degradation. Moreover, because we have outsourced our data center operations, the operation and performance of the data center involve factors beyond our control. Any significant degradation or failure of our computer systems,
communications systems or any other systems in the performance of our services could cause our clients or their customers to suffer delays in their receipt of our services. These delays could cause substantial losses for our clients or their
customers, and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures. Our liability risk is anticipated in our services agreements with our clients and our insurance coverage. However, we may not be adequately protected against
all possible losses through the terms of our services agreements and our insurance coverage. In addition, such failures could cause us to lose revenues, lose clients or damage our reputation.

Operational errors in the performance of our services could lead to liability for claims, client loss and result in reputational damage.

The failure to properly perform our services could result in our clients and/or certain of our subsidiaries being subjected to censures,
fines, or other sanctions by applicable regulatory authorities, and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those errors. Our liability risk is anticipated in our services agreements with our clients and our insurance coverage.
However, we may not be adequately protected against all possible losses through the terms of our services agreements and our insurance coverage. In addition, such errors could cause us to lose revenues, lose clients or damage our reputation.



General economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that are beyond our
control may contribute to reduced levels of activity in the securities markets, which could result in lower revenues from our business operations.

The number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients, the level of investor communications activity we process on behalf of our clients, trading volumes, market prices, and
liquidity of the securities markets are affected by general national and international economic and political conditions, and broad trends in business and finance that result in changes in participation and activity in the securities markets. These
factors include:

•

economic, political and market conditions;

•

legislative and regulatory changes;

•

the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital;

•

the level and volatility of interest rates;

•

currency values and inflation; and

•

national, state, and local taxation levels affecting securities transactions.

These factors are beyond our control and may contribute to reduced levels of participation and activity in the securities markets. Our
revenues have historically been largely driven by transaction processing based on levels of participation and activity in the securities markets. Accordingly, any significant reduction in participation and activity in the securities markets would
likely result in lower revenues from our business operations.

If the operational systems and infrastructure that we depend on fail to
keep pace with our growth, we may experience operating inefficiencies, client dissatisfaction and lost revenue opportunities.

The growth of our business and expansion of our client base may place a strain on our management and operations. We believe that our current and anticipated future growth will require the implementation
of new and enhanced communications and information systems, the training of personnel to operate these systems, and the expansion and upgrade of core technologies. While many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional growth without
redesign or replacement, we may nevertheless need to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate growth. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to predict the timing or rate of this growth
accurately or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure on a timely basis.

Our growth has required and will continue
to require increased investments in management personnel and systems, financial systems and controls, and office facilities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to manage or continue to manage our future growth successfully. If we fail to
manage our growth, we may experience operating inefficiencies, dissatisfaction among our client base, and lost revenue opportunities.

If we are unable to respond to the demands of our existing and new clients, our ability to reach our revenue goals or maintain our profitability
could be diminished.

The global financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex and integrated
infrastructures and products, new and changing business models and rapid technological and regulatory changes. Our clients’ needs and demands for our products and services evolve with these changes. Our future success will depend, in part, on
our ability to respond to our clients’ demands for new services, capabilities and technologies on a timely and cost-effective basis, to adapt to technological advancements and changing regulatory standards, and to address our clients’
increasingly sophisticated requirements.



Intense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and
profitability.

The markets for our products and services continue to evolve and are highly competitive. We compete
with a number of firms that provide similar products and services. In addition, our securities processing solutions compete with our clients’ in-house capabilities to perform competitive functions. Our competitors may be able to respond more
quickly to new or changing opportunities, technologies, and client requirements and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities, offer more attractive terms to clients and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we will be
able to offer or adopt. In addition, we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies, including international providers of similar products and services to ours. There can be no assurances
that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors. If we fail to compete effectively, our market share could decrease and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially harmed.

Our business, financial position, and results of operations could be harmed by adverse rating actions by credit rating agencies.

If the credit ratings of our outstanding indebtedness are downgraded, or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade
may occur, our business, financial position, and results of operations could be adversely affected and perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged. A downgrade would have the effect of increasing our borrowing costs, and could decrease
the availability of funds we are able to borrow, adversely affecting our business, financial position, and results of operations. In addition, a downgrade could adversely affect our relationships with our clients. For further information with
respect to our borrowing costs, see Note 13, “Borrowings” to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We may be unable to attract and retain key personnel.

Our continued
success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel such as our senior management and other qualified personnel to conduct our business. The market for such experienced senior managers and other qualified personnel is extremely
competitive. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required key personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our recruiting and retention costs increase
significantly, our operations and financial results could be materially adversely affected.

The inability to identify, obtain and
retain important intellectual property rights to technology could harm our business.

Our success depends in part upon
the development and acquisition of systems and applications to conduct our business. Our success will increasingly depend in part on our ability to identify, obtain and retain intellectual property rights to technology, both for internal use as well
as for use in providing services to our clients, either through internal development, acquisition or licensing from others, or alliances with others. Our inability to identify, obtain and retain rights to certain technology on favorable terms and
conditions would make it difficult to conduct business, or to timely introduce new and innovative products and services, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our products and services, and the products and services provided to us by third parties, may infringe upon intellectual property rights of third
parties, and any infringement claims could require us to incur substantial costs, distract our management, or prevent us from conducting our business.

Although we attempt to avoid infringing upon known proprietary rights of third parties, we are subject to the risk of claims alleging infringement of third-party proprietary rights. If we infringe upon
the rights of third parties, we may be unable to obtain licenses to use those rights on commercially reasonable terms. Additionally,



third parties that provide us with products and services that are integral to the conduct of our business may be subject to similar allegations, which could prevent them from continuing to
provide these products and services to us. In either of these events, we would need to undertake substantial reengineering in order to continue offering our services and we may not succeed in doing so. In addition, any claim of infringement could
cause us to incur substantial costs defending the claim, even if the claim is invalid, and could distract our management from our business. Furthermore, a party making such a claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages.
A judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from conducting our business.

Acquisitions and
integrating such acquisitions create certain risks and may affect operating results.

From time to time, we engage in,
and expect to continue to engage in, business acquisitions. The acquisition and integration of businesses involve a number of risks. The core risks are in the areas of:

•

valuation: negotiating a fair price for the business based on inherently limited due diligence reviews;

•

integration: managing the complex process of integrating the acquired company’s people, products, technology, and other assets so as to realize
the projected value of the acquired company and the synergies projected to be realized in connection with the acquisition; and

•

legacy issues: protecting against actions, claims, regulatory investigations, losses, and other liabilities related to the predecessor business.

Also, the process of integrating these businesses may disrupt our business and divert our resources. These
risks may arise for a number of reasons including, for example:

•

finding suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms;

•

competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirors;

•

incurring unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with such acquisitions;

•

devoting unanticipated financial and management resources to an acquired business;

•

borrowing money from lenders or selling equity or debt securities to the public to finance future acquisitions on terms that may be adverse to us;

•

entering markets where we have minimal prior experience; and

•

experiencing decreases in earnings as a result of non-cash impairment charges.

In addition, international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including, for example:

•

geographically separated organizations, systems, and facilities;

•

integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures;

•

complying with foreign regulatory requirements;

•

enforcing intellectual property rights in some foreign countries; and

•

general economic and political conditions.

We operate internationally and our operations could be adversely impacted by local legal, economic, political and other conditions.

A portion of our revenue is generated outside the U.S. and in recent years, we have expanded our operations and acquired businesses
outside the U.S. Also, our business is highly dependent on the global financial services industry and exchanges and market centers around the world. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which we operate, or inadequate enforcement of
laws or policies such as those protecting intellectual property,



could affect our business and the company’s overall results of operations. Our operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries, particularly in those
with developing economies, and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation and currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and non-U.S. currencies. In addition, our operations and our ability to deliver our services to our clients
could be adversely impacted if there is instability, disruption or destruction in certain geographic regions including as a result of natural or man-made disasters, wars, terrorist activities, or any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or
other local or global health issue.

Our mutual fund processing services may be exposed to risk from our counterparties and third
parties.

In the normal course of business, our mutual fund processing services involve the settlement of transactions
on behalf of our customers and third parties. With these activities, we may be exposed to risk in the event our customers, other broker-dealers, banks, clearing organizations, or depositories are unable to fulfill contractual obligations and the
mutual fund counterparty is not able to cancel the transaction.

Our revenues are subject to seasonal variations because we process and
distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports in our fourth fiscal quarter.

Processing and
distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors in equity securities and mutual funds comprises a large portion of our Investor Communication Solutions business. We process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and
annual reports during our fourth fiscal quarter. The recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies and mutual funds. Historically, this has caused our revenues,
operating income, net earnings, and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other fiscal quarter. The seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the
results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows on a fiscal quarter-by-quarter basis.

None.

ITEM 2.

Properties.

We operate
our business from 49 facilities. We own a 20,000 square foot facility in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, where we perform certain product development functions. We also own a 36,000 square foot facility in Wheat Ridge, Colorado, where we perform
securities processing services. We lease three facilities in Edgewood, New York, with a combined space of 643,065 square feet which are used in connection with our Investor Communication Solutions business. We lease space at 44 additional
locations, subject to customary lease arrangements, including a 68,000 square foot facility in Lake Success, New York, that serves as our corporate headquarters as well as the location of our business process outsourcing services business. Our
leases expire on a staggered basis. We believe our facilities are currently adequate for their intended purposes and are adequately maintained.

ITEM 3.

Legal Proceedings.

In
the normal course of business, the Company is subject to claims and litigation. While the outcome of any claim or litigation is inherently unpredictable, the Company believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not, individually or in
the aggregate, result in a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

ITEM 5.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

Our common stock began trading “regular way” on the NYSE under the symbol “BR” on April 2, 2007. There were
14,150 stockholders of record of the Company’s common stock as of July 31, 2013. This figure excludes an estimate of the indeterminate number of beneficial holders whose shares may be held of record by brokerage firms and clearing
agencies. The following table presents the high and low closing prices of the Company’s common stock on the NYSE as well as the cash dividends per share of common stock declared during the fiscal quarters indicated:

Dividend Policy

We expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock. On August 7, 2013, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend by $0.03 per share to $0.21 per share, an increase in our annual
dividend amount from $0.72 to $0.84 per share. However, the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and will depend upon many factors, including our financial
condition, earnings, capital requirements of our businesses, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant.

As a holding company with no material liquid assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries, our ability to pay dividends will
be dependent on our receiving dividends from our operating subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries through which we provide our business process outsourcing and mutual fund processing services, are regulated and may be subject to restrictions on their
ability to pay dividends to us.



Performance Graph

The following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return on Broadridge common stock from June 30, 2007 to June 30, 2013 with the comparable cumulative return of (i) the S&P
400 MidCap Index, and (ii) the S&P 400 Information Technology Index. The graph assumes $100 was invested on June 30, 2007 in our common stock and in each of the indices and assumes that all cash dividends are reinvested. The table
below the graph shows the dollar value of those investments as of the dates in the graph. The comparisons in the graph are required by the SEC and are not intended to forecast or be indicative of future performance of our common stock.

The following performance graph and related information shall not be deemed “soliciting material” or to be “filed”

DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY AND BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Broadridge is a leading global provider of investor communications and technology-driven solutions to banks, broker-dealers, mutual funds
and corporate issuers. Our systems and services include investor communication solutions, and securities processing and business process outsourcing services. In short, we provide the infrastructure that helps the financial services industry
operate. With over 50 years of experience, we provide financial services firms with advanced, dependable, scalable and cost-effective integrated systems. Our systems help reduce the need for clients to make significant capital investments in
operations infrastructure, thereby allowing them to increase their focus on core business activities. Our operations are classified into two business segments: Investor Communication Solutions and Securities Processing Solutions.

Investor Communication Solutions

A large portion of our Investor Communication Solutions business involves the processing and distribution of proxy materials to investors in equity securities and mutual funds, as well as the facilitation
of related vote processing. ProxyEdge, our innovative electronic proxy delivery and voting solution for institutional investors and financial advisors, helps ensure the participation of the largest stockholders of many companies. We also provide the
distribution of regulatory reports and corporate action/reorganization event information, as well as tax reporting solutions that help our clients meet their regulatory compliance needs. In addition, we provide financial information distribution and
transaction reporting services to both financial institutions and securities issuers. These services include the processing and distribution of account statements and trade confirmations, traditional and personalized document fulfillment and content
management services, marketing communications, and imaging, archival and workflow solutions that enable and enhance our clients’ communications with investors. All of these communications are delivered through paper or electronic channels.

In addition, Broadridge provides corporate issuers with registered proxy services. Three years ago, Broadridge entered the
transfer agency business through its acquisition of a provider of registrar, stock transfer and record-keeping services.



Securities Processing Solutions

We offer a suite of advanced computerized real-time transaction processing services that automate the securities transaction lifecycle,
from desktop productivity tools, data aggregation, performance reporting, and portfolio management to order capture and execution, trade confirmation, settlement, and accounting. Our services help financial institutions efficiently and
cost-effectively consolidate their books and records, gather and service assets under management, focus on their core businesses, and manage risk. With multi-currency capabilities, our Global Processing Solution supports real-time global trading of
equity, option, mutual fund, and fixed income securities in established and emerging markets. In addition, our business process outsourcing services allow broker-dealers to outsource certain administrative functions relating to clearing and
settlement, from order entry to trade matching and settlement, while maintaining their ability to finance and capitalize their business.

ACQUISITIONS

Assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations were recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the respective acquisition dates based upon their estimated fair values at such dates. The results of operations of
businesses acquired by the Company were included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Earnings since their respective dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the underlying assets acquired
and liabilities assumed was allocated to Goodwill.

There were no acquisitions in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013.

Acquisitions completed by the Company with an aggregate purchase price of greater than $15.0 million during the fiscal years
ended June 30, 2012, and 2011, were as follows:

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, the Company acquired
one business in the Securities Processing Solutions segment:

Paladyne Systems, Inc.

In September 2011, the Company acquired Paladyne, a provider of buy-side technology solutions for the global investment management
industry. The purchase price was $72.4 million, net of cash acquired of $8.3 million. Net liabilities assumed were $15.4 million. This acquisition resulted in $64.0 million of goodwill. Intangible assets acquired, which totaled $23.8 million,
consist primarily of acquired software technology and customer relationships, which are being amortized over a seven-year life and ten-year life, respectively. This acquisition was not material to the Company’s consolidated operations,
financial position, or cash flows.

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, the Company acquired three businesses in
the Investor Communication Solutions segment. A summary of each acquisition is as follows:

NewRiver, Inc.

In August 2010, the Company acquired NewRiver Inc. (“NewRiver”), a leader in mutual fund electronic
investor disclosure solutions. The purchase price was $77.6 million, net of cash acquired. This acquisition resulted in $47.8 million of goodwill, after post-closing adjustments for deferred taxes. Intangible assets acquired, which totaled $27.3
million, consist primarily of customer relationships and software technology, which are being amortized over an eight-year and seven-year life, respectively. This acquisition was not material to the Company’s operations, financial position, or
cash flows.

Forefield, Inc.

In December 2010, the Company acquired Forefield Inc. (“Forefield”), a leading provider of real-time sales, education and client communication solutions for financial institutions and their
advisors. The purchase price



was $18.3 million, net of cash acquired. This acquisition resulted in $11.1 million of goodwill, after post-closing adjustments for deferred taxes. Intangible assets acquired, which totaled $6.8
million, primarily consist of customer relationships and software technology which are being amortized over a seven-year and a five-year life, respectively. This acquisition was not material to the Company’s operations, financial position, or
cash flows.

Matrix Financial Solutions, Inc.

In January 2011, the Company acquired Matrix Financial Solutions, Inc. (“Matrix”), a provider of mutual fund processing services
for third party administrators, financial advisors, banks and wealth management professionals. Matrix’s back-office, trust, custody, trading and mutual fund settlement services are integrated into Broadridge’s solution suite; thereby
strengthening our role as a provider of data processing and distribution channel solutions to the mutual fund industry. The purchase price was $197.6 million, net of cash acquired.

This acquisition resulted in $154.7 million of goodwill, after post-closing adjustments for deferred taxes. Goodwill primarily resulted
from the Company’s expectation of sales growth and cost synergies from the integration of Matrix’s technology and product offerings with the Company’s technology and operations to provide an expansion of products and market reach.
Intangible assets acquired, which totaled $71.5 million, consist of customer relationships, software technology, trademarks and non-compete agreements, which are being amortized over a ten-year, seven-year, five-year and three-year life,
respectively. This acquisition was not material to the Company’s operations, financial position, or cash flows.

DIVESTITURES

In November 2009, the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary Ridge Clearing & Outsourcing Solutions, Inc.
(“Ridge”), entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Penson Worldwide, Inc. (“PWI”) and Penson Financial Services, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of PWI (“PFSI,” referred
to together with PWI as “Penson”), to sell substantially all contracts of the securities clearing clients of Ridge to PFSI.

On June 25, 2010, the Company completed the sale of the contracts of substantially all of the securities clearing clients of Ridge to PFSI for an aggregate purchase price of $35.2 million. The
purchase price paid to Broadridge consisted of (i) a five-year subordinated note from PWI (the “Seller Note”) in the principal amount of $20.6 million bearing interest at an annual rate equal to the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate
(“LIBOR”) plus 550 basis points, and (ii) 2,455,627 shares of PWI’s common stock (representing 9.5% of PWI’s outstanding common stock as of May 31, 2010), at the June 25, 2010 closing price of PWI’s common
stock of $5.95 per share (the “Seller Shares”). As a result of this transaction, we no longer provide securities clearing services for correspondent broker-dealers but continue to provide business process outsourcing services aligned with
the Securities Processing Solutions business. See Note 8, “Impairment and Other Charges, Net” to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion on the Seller Note and
the Seller Shares.

Concurrent with entering into the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company entered into a master services
agreement with PWI (the “Outsourcing Services Agreement”) for an eleven-year term expiring in December 2022. Under the Outsourcing Services Agreement, Ridge provided securities processing and back-office support services to PFSI, including
services for the clients acquired from Ridge and PWI’s existing clients. On June 5, 2012, the Company entered into a ten-year master services agreement (the “Apex MSA”) with Apex Clearing Corporation (“Apex Clearing”)
under which Broadridge will perform outsourcing services for Apex Clearing consistent with the securities processing and back-office support services it had previously performed for Penson. The Apex MSA was part of a series of related transactions
involving Broadridge, Penson, PEAK6 Investments,



L.P. (“PEAK6”) and Apex Clearing Holdings LLC (“Apex Holdings”), an entity created by Penson and PEAK6 to provide clearing and related services to Penson’s U.S.
securities correspondents. As part of the series of related transactions, Broadridge transferred ownership of its broker-dealer subsidiary, Ridge, to Apex Holdings and Ridge was renamed Apex Clearing Corporation. Penson’s U.S. broker-dealer
subsidiary, PFSI, then sold its U.S. clearing contracts to Apex Clearing.

In addition, on June 5, 2012, Broadridge,
Ridge (prior to its transfer to Apex Holdings) and Broadridge Financial Solutions (Canada), Inc. entered into a termination and mutual release agreement with Penson, PFSI and Penson Financial Services Canada, Inc. (“PFSC”) (the
“Termination Agreement”), thereby terminating certain schedules including the U.S. schedule (the “U.S. Schedule”) to the Outsourcing Services Agreement. See Note 7, “Discontinued Operations” to our Consolidated
Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion on the impact of the Termination Agreement.

The Termination Agreement: (i) terminated the schedules under the Outsourcing Services Agreement, including the U.S. Schedule, other than to the extent necessary to provide any transition services
that may be required under the Apex MSA and for Broadridge to continue to service Penson’s Canadian subsidiary, PFSC; and (ii) terminated, discharged and released in full Penson’s obligations, including all obligations to make
principal and interest payments, under the Seller Note. The Termination Agreement also provided that Penson and Broadridge mutually release all claims arising under the Outsourcing Services Agreement, provided that Broadridge will retain claims of
up to $20 million under the Outsourcing Services Agreement against PFSC while Penson retained all of its rights under the Outsourcing Services Agreement to defend any such claims against PFSC.

See Note 7, “Discontinued Operations” to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K for detailed information on discontinued operations.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.
(“GAAP”). These financial statements present the consolidated position of the Company. These financial statements include the entities in which the Company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest and various entities in
which the Company has investments recorded under the cost and equity methods of accounting. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

In presenting the Consolidated Financial Statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures. Estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment
and available information. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. In management’s opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results
reported. The results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

We continually evaluate the accounting
policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. The estimates are based on historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management.
Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.

Goodwill

.

We review the carrying value of all our goodwill in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) No. 350, “Intangibles—Goodwill and
Other” (“ASC No. 350”), by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values. We are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment.
When determining fair value, we utilize a discounted future cash flow approach using various assumptions, including projections of revenues based on



assumed long-term growth rates, estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business’ weighted-average cost of capital. The principal factors used in the
discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows, the weighted-average cost of capital and the terminal value growth rate assumptions. The weighted-average cost of capital takes into account the relative
weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and long-term debt). Our estimates of long-term growth and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of external sources, and are developed as
part of our routine, long-range planning process. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. We had $778.4 million of goodwill as of June 30, 2013. Given the
significance of our goodwill, an adverse change to the fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our earnings.

The Company performs a sensitivity analysis under Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in ASC No. 350, assuming hypothetical reductions in the fair values of our reporting units. A
10% change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows, discount rates, or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would not result in an impairment of our goodwill.

Income Taxes

.

We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC No. 740, “Income Taxes,” which
establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and
assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our
Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). The Company is subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS, state and foreign
tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements. As of June 30, 2013, we had estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $22.8
million of which $1.9 million expires in 2017 through 2027 and $20.9 million which has an indefinite utilization period. In addition, the Company has estimated U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $54.6 million,
which expire in 2018 through 2032. We have recorded valuation allowances of $12.5 million and $14.7 million at June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, because the Company does not believe that it is more likely than not that it will be able
to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to net operating and capital loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings.

Share-based Payments

.

ASC No. 718 “Compensation—Stock Compensation” requires the measurement of stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the
award on the date of grant. We determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option-pricing model. The binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest
rate and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of our stock price and other factors. Similarly, the dividend
yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk-free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture
assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. Determining
these assumptions are subjective and complex, and therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options. A hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility
assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2013 stock option grants would result in approximately a $1.4 million change in total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2013 grants, which would be amortized
over the vesting period. A hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2013 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.2 million change in the total pre-tax
stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2013 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. A hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2013 stock



option grants would result in approximately a $0.1 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2013 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting
period. A hypothetical one-half percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2013 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.5 million change in the total pre-tax
stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2013 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period.

IBM INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY SERVICES AGREEMENT

In March 2010, the Company and IBM entered into the IT Services Agreement, under which IBM
provides certain aspects of the Company’s information technology infrastructure that were previously provided by ADP. Under the IT Services Agreement, IBM will provide a broad range of technology services to the Company including supporting its
mainframe, midrange, server, network and data center operations, as well as providing disaster recovery services. The Company has the option of incorporating additional services into the agreement over time. The IT Services Agreement expires on
June 30, 2022. The Company has the right to renew the initial term of the IT Services Agreement for up to one additional 12-month term.

During the course of the migration to IBM, the Company incurred total migration costs of $85.6 million as part of establishing an operable IBM data center. $30.9 million of these costs were expensed,
$24.6 million in fiscal year 2012 and $6.3 million in fiscal year 2011. $54.7 million of these costs were capitalized, with $5.9 million amortized through June 30, 2013. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, the Company
recorded total expenses of $96.3 million and $24.6 million, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings related to this agreement.

The migration of our data center processing from ADP to IBM was completed in August 2012. The Company realized approximately $15.0 million in cost savings, net of deferred cost amortization, in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2013, and is anticipating that it will realize approximately $25.0 million in average annual cost savings, net of deferred cost amortization, over the term of the IT Services Agreement beginning in the fiscal year ending
June 30, 2014.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

“Restructuring Charges” represent severance costs, the impact of one-time system
development costs for Apex and Penson Canada, and a one-time cost to restructure and outsource certain processing related to our desktop applications.

“Restructuring and Impairment Charges, net” referred to herein represent the Restructuring Charges defined above and the following charges that were referred to as “Penson Charges,
net” in the prior fiscal year:

•

“Penson Transition costs” represent transition costs incurred in fiscal year 2013 related to the June 2012 termination and mutual release
agreement with Penson and PFSC terminating the Penson outsourcing services contract, including the transfer of the Ridge entity to Apex Holdings.

•

“Penson OTTI charge” refers to the charge that resulted after the Company reviewed its investment in the PWI common stock for impairment.
Based on the Company’s review, factoring in the level of decline in the fair value of the PWI common stock, management determined that the market value of the PWI common stock may not equal or exceed the cost basis of our investment within a
reasonable period of time. After consideration of the severity and duration of this decline in fair value as well as the reasons for the decline in value, the Company recorded an “other than temporary” impairment charge of $12.5 million
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012.

•

“Penson Note Receivable impairment charge” refers to the charge the Company recorded as a result of a restructuring support agreement
Broadridge and Ridge entered into with PWI and certain of its subsidiaries on March 13, 2012. The restructuring support agreement provided for proposed transactions related to the restructuring of Penson’s outstanding indebtedness,
including the note receivable in the principal amount of $20.6 million issued by PWI to Broadridge as part of the consideration in the sale of the Ridge clearing contracts to Penson. As part of PWI’s proposed debt restructuring, Broadridge
agreed to cancel this note receivable in exchange for additional shares of PWI’s common stock, and the Company recorded a $21.4 million charge at June 30, 2012, which included $0.8 million of accrued interest on the note receivable.

•

“Penson Deferred Costs impairment charge” refers to the charge the Company recorded as a result of the termination of the U.S. Schedule to
the Outsourcing Services Agreement on June 5, 2012. Upon termination of this agreement, Broadridge determined that a charge for impairment was appropriate on Broadridge’s deferred client conversion and start-up costs associated with the
Outsourcing Services Agreement. The charge taken by the Company on the deferred costs was $47.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, representing all deferred costs related to the Outsourcing Services Agreement with Penson.

•

“Eliminated obligation to pay or credit Penson fees” refers to Broadridge’s obligation to pay or credit to Penson fees in the amount of
$15.1 million related to a third party vendor’s services that were replaced by the Outsourcing Services Agreement that was extinguished with the termination of the U.S. Schedule to the Outsourcing Services Agreement on June 5, 2012.

•

“Penson Shutdown costs” refers to costs of $8.2 million including severance, legal and other costs associated with the Penson transaction
consummated on June 5, 2012 including the transfer of the Ridge entity to Apex Holdings.

The following
definitions describe the Company’s Revenues:

Fee revenues in the Investor Communication Solutions segment are derived
from both recurring and event-driven activity. In addition, the level of recurring and event-driven activity we process directly impacts distribution revenues. While event-driven activity is highly repeatable, it may not recur on an annual basis.
The types of services we provide that comprise event-driven activity are:

•

Mutual Fund Proxy: The proxy and related services we provide to mutual funds when certain events occur requiring a shareholder vote including changes
in directors, sub-advisors, fee structures, investment restrictions, and mergers of funds.



•

Mutual Fund Communications: Mutual fund communications services consist primarily of the distribution on behalf of mutual funds of supplemental
information required to be provided to the annual mutual fund prospectus as a result of certain triggering events such as a change in portfolio managers. In addition, mutual fund communications consist of notices and marketing materials such as
newsletters.

•

Proxy Contests and Specials, Corporate Actions, and Other: The proxy services we provide in connection with shareholder meetings driven by special
events such as proxy contests, mergers and acquisitions, and tender/exchange offers.

Event-driven fee
revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process. Event-driven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements, resulting in fluctuations in the timing and
levels of event-driven fee revenue. As such, the timing and level of event-driven activity and its potential impact on revenues and earnings is difficult to forecast.

Generally, mutual fund proxy activity has been subject to a greater level of volatility than the other components of event-driven activity. During fiscal year 2013, mutual fund proxy fee revenues were 54%
higher than the prior fiscal year while during fiscal years 2012 and 2011, mutual fund proxy revenues were 28% and 74% lower, respectively, than their prior fiscal years. Although it is difficult to forecast the levels of event-driven activity, we
expect that the portion of fee revenues derived from mutual fund proxy activity may continue to experience volatility in the future.

Revenues derived from sales are a component of “Net New Business,” which is defined herein as our closed sales less client losses. Closed sales represent anticipated revenues for new client
contracts that were signed by Broadridge during the periods referenced. A sale is considered closed when the Company has received the signed client contract. For recurring revenue closed sales, the amount of the closed sale is generally a
reasonable estimate of annual revenues based on client volumes or activity, excluding pass-through revenues such as distribution revenues. Event-driven revenue closed sales primarily occur in our Investor Communication Solutions segment. The amount
of the event-driven revenue closed sale is generally a reasonable estimate of production revenues based on client volumes or activity, excluding pass-through revenues such as distribution revenues. Broadridge’s determination of the amount
of a closed sale is based on the client’s estimate of transaction volumes and activity levels, as our fees are largely based on transaction volume and activity levels. The inherent variability of transaction volumes and activity levels can
result in some variability of amounts reported as closed sales. Larger recurring revenue closed sales can take up to 12 to 24 months to convert to revenues, particularly for the services provided by our Securities Processing Solutions segment. The
majority of event-driven revenue closed sales are usually recognized during the year the contract is signed.

The Company
tracks actual revenue achieved during the first year that the client contract is fully implemented and compares this to the amount that was included in the Company’s previously reported closed sales amount. The Company adjusts the current year
closed sales amount for any difference between the prior year’s reported closed sales amount and the actual revenue achieved in the first year of the applicable contract. Closed sales were adjusted by $(5.9) million, $(3.1) million and
$0.9 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Recurring revenue closed sales were adjusted by $(6.5) million, $(3.1) million and $0.9 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and
2011, respectively. Event-driven revenue closed sales were adjusted by $0.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013.



ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS

Fiscal Year 2013 Compared to Fiscal Year 2012

The table below presents Consolidated Statements of Earnings from continuing operations data for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods:

Revenues

.

Revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 were $2,430.8
million, an increase of $127.3 million, or 6%, compared to $2,303.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. The $127.3 million increase was driven by higher recurring fee revenues of $56.9 million, higher distribution revenues of $50.3
million and higher event-driven fee revenues of $23.6 million, mainly due to higher mutual fund proxy and supplemental prospectus activity. The positive contribution from recurring fee revenues reflected higher Net New Business and to a lesser
extent, gains from an Acquisition partially offset by lower internal growth. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted revenues by $3.5 million.

Closed sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 were $157.5 million, an increase of $8.8 million, or 6%, compared to $148.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. Recurring
revenue closed sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 were $120.8 million, an increase of $0.6 million compared to $120.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. Event-driven closed sales for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2013 were $36.7 million, an increase of $8.2 million, or 29%, compared to $28.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012.

Total Expenses

.

Total expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 were $2,107.6 million, an increase of $5.0 million compared to $2,102.6 million for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2012. The increase reflects higher Cost of revenues of $52.7 million or 3%, higher Selling, general and administrative expenses of $23.7 million, or 8%, offset by impairment charges, net of $74.2 million in the prior period. Other
expenses, net increased $2.8 million or 21%.

Cost of revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 were $1,767.8
million, an increase of $52.7 million, or 3%, compared to $1,715.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. The increase reflects higher variable costs of $45.2 million on higher fee revenues, higher cost of distribution revenues of
$41.3 million, higher restructuring costs of $18.2 million and costs of $4.5 million related to acquisitions. These costs were partially offset by IBM Migration costs incurred in the prior year of $24.6 million, savings related to the migration of
the data center to IBM of $16.2 million and lower investment spend of $8.3 million. Distribution



cost of revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 were $662.3 million, an increase of $41.3 million, or 7%, compared to $621.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012.
Distribution cost of revenues consists primarily of postage related expenses. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates decreased cost of revenues by $5.5 million.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 were $323.6 million, an increase of $23.7 million, or 8%, compared to $299.9 million for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2012. The 8% increase was mainly due to higher costs related to higher sales and marketing expenses of $13.2 million, strategic initiatives of $4.0 million and the impact of a one-time non-recurring credit in the prior year of $2.4
million.

There were no impairment charges for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. Impairment charges, net for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 were $74.2 million.

Other expenses, net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013
were $16.2 million, an increase of $2.8 million, compared to $13.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. The increase is primarily driven by $1.8 million of interest expenses to settle certain income tax adjustments related to tax
years 2007 through 2012 as a result of the settlement and execution of an Advance Pricing Agreement (“APA”) with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and Canadian Revenue Authority (“CRA”), along with higher
interest expenses on our

Long-term

borrowings of $0.5 million. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates increased Other expenses, net by $0.5 million.

Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes

. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 were $323.2 million, an increase of $122.3 million, or 61%, compared to $200.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. The increase is mainly due to higher Revenues, increased margins driven by the
mix of business, impairment charges and IBM Migration costs in the prior period and cost containment. Margin increased from 8.7% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 to 13.3% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013.

Provision for income taxes

. Provision for income taxes and effective tax rates for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013
were $111.1 million and 34.4%, respectively, compared to $75.9 million and 37.8%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, respectively. The change in the Company’s effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the recognition this
fiscal year of certain prior year foreign tax credits, changes in the geographical mix of income and last fiscal year’s valuation allowance on capital tax losses related to the PWI common stock and write-off of certain state net operating loss
carryforwards.

Net earnings from continuing operations and Basic and Diluted earnings per share from continuing
operations

.

Net earnings from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 were $212.1 million, an increase of $87.1 million, or 70%, compared to $125.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. The
increase in Net earnings from continuing operations reflects higher revenues, increased margins driven by the mix of business, impairment charges and IBM Migration costs recorded in the prior year and cost containment.

Basic and Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 were $1.74, an increase of
$0.73, or 72%, and $1.69, an increase of $0.71, or 72%, respectively, compared to $1.01 and $0.98 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, respectively. Restructuring and Impairment Charges, net decreased Basic and Diluted earnings per share by
$0.10 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. The IBM Migration costs and Restructuring and Impairment Charges, net decreased diluted earnings per share in the prior year by $0.12 and $0.45 respectively.



Fiscal Year 2012 Compared to Fiscal Year 2011

The table below presents Consolidated Statements of Earnings from continuing operations data for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012
and 2011, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods:

Revenues

.

Revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 were $2,303.5
million, an increase of $136.6 million, or 6%, compared to $2,166.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. The $136.6 million increase was driven by higher recurring fee revenues of $139.6 million and higher distribution revenues
of $0.3 million, partially offset by lower event-driven fee revenues, which declined from $135.0 million to $131.9 million, or $3.1 million, mainly due to lower mutual fund proxy activity. The positive contribution from recurring fee revenues
reflected higher Net New Business, revenues from internal growth, gains from Acquisitions, and the Outsourcing Services Agreement. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates were unfavorably impacted by $0.2 million. Revenues from Acquisitions
and the Outsourcing Services Agreement contributed $109.8 million.

Closed sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012
were $148.7 million, an increase of $15.0 million, or 11%, compared to $133.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. Recurring revenue closed sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 were $120.2 million, an increase of $6.8
million, or 6%, compared to $113.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011.

Total Expenses

.

Impairment Charges contributed $105.5 million, or 51%, of the $205.4 million increase in Total expenses. Costs related to our Acquisitions and the Outsourcing Services Agreement constituted $87.0 million, or 42%, of the increase in Total expenses.
The remaining increases to Total expenses constitute costs related to our core business operations. These items are discussed in detail in the following paragraphs:

Cost of revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 were $1,715.1 million, an increase of $98.0 million, or 6%, compared to $1,617.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. The
increase reflects costs of $40.1 million related to Acquisitions and the Outsourcing Services Agreement, distribution costs of $8.0 million, increased IBM Migration costs of $18.3 million, Restructuring Charges of $6.7 million, and other variable
costs of $35.4 million. Distribution cost of revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 were $621.0 million, an



increase of $7.5 million, or 1%, compared to $613.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. Distribution cost of revenues consists primarily of postage related expenses.
Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates decreased cost of revenues by $2.8 million.

Selling, general and
administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 were $299.9 million, an increase of $29.9 million, or 11%, compared to $270.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. The 11% increase was mainly due to increased
costs related to Acquisitions of $16.0 million, and higher selling expenses of $10.4 million on higher closed sales. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates decreased Selling, general and administrative expenses by $1.0 million.

Impairment and other charges, net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 were $74.2 million as a result of the Penson OTTI charge,
the Penson Note Receivable impairment charge, the Penson Deferred Costs impairment charge, the Eliminated obligation to pay or credit Penson fees, and the Penson Shutdown costs.

Other expenses, net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 were $13.4 million, an increase of $3.3 million, compared to $10.1
million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. The increase is primarily driven by higher interest expense on our Long-term borrowings of $3.4 million. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates slightly decreased Other expenses, net by
$1.4 million.

Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes

. Earnings from continuing operations
before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 were $200.9 million, a decrease of $68.8 million, or 26%, compared to $269.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. The decrease is mainly due to higher Total expenses
which more than offset the increase in Revenues. As discussed above, higher Total expenses were driven by the IBM Migration costs and Restructuring and Impairment Charges. Margin decreased from 12.4% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 to
8.7% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. The impact of the IBM Migration costs, and Restructuring and Impairment Charges was 460 basis points on the Margin for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012.

Provision for income taxes

. Provision for income taxes and Effective tax rates for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012
were $75.9 million and 37.8%, respectively, compared to $97.9 million and 36.3%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, respectively. The change in the Company’s Effective tax rate was attributable to a valuation allowance on capital tax
losses related to the PWI common stock, a write-off of certain state net operating loss carryforwards and changes in the geographical mix of income.

Net earnings from continuing operations and Basic and Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations

.

Net earnings from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2012 were $125.0 million, a decrease of $46.8 million, or 27%, compared to $171.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. The decrease in Net earnings from continuing operations reflects lower Earnings from continuing
operations, as discussed above, including the impact of the IBM Migration costs, and Restructuring and Impairment Charges.

Basic and Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 were $1.01, a decrease of
$0.37, or 27%, and $0.98, a decrease of $0.36, or 27%, respectively, compared to $1.38 and $1.34 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, respectively. The IBM Migration costs, and Restructuring and Impairment Charges decreased diluted earnings
per share by $0.12 and $0.45, respectively.

ANALYSIS OF REPORTABLE SEGMENTS

Broadridge has two reportable operating business segments: (1) Investor Communication Solutions and (2) Securities Processing
Solutions. Ridge’s securities clearing business is reflected in discontinued operations (see Note 1, “Basis of Presentation” and Note 7, “Discontinued Operations” to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of
Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for detailed information on discontinued operations), and the business process outsourcing services business is now reported as part of the Securities Processing Solutions business segment. This change is
reflected in all prior periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



The primary components of “Other” are IBM Migration costs, Restructuring and
Impairment Charges, and the elimination of intersegment revenues and profits as well as certain unallocated expenses. Foreign exchange is a reconciling item between the actual foreign exchange rates and budgeted foreign exchange rates.

Certain corporate expenses, as well as certain centrally managed expenses, are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable
manner. Because the Company compensates the management of its various businesses on, among other factors, segment profit, the Company may elect to record certain segment-related expense items of an unusual or non-recurring nature in consolidation
rather than reflect such items in segment profit.

contributed $0.3 million, and were partially offset by lower event-driven fee revenues, which declined from $135.0 million to $131.9 million, or $3.1 million. The positive contribution from recurring fee revenues were driven primarily by Net New
Business, internal growth, and Acquisitions. The decrease in event-driven fee revenues was primarily due to lower mutual fund proxy activity. Distribution revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 were $704.4 million, an increase of $0.3
million, compared to $704.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. Position growth was positive 1% for annual equity proxy and positive 9% for mutual fund interim communications, resulting in a net increase in pieces processed

Adjusted Net Earnings from Continuing Operations

We define Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations as Net earnings from continuing operations, net of taxes excluding all items associated with Acquisition Amortization and Other Costs,
Restructuring and Impairment Charges, net, and IBM Migration costs. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations is not a measure defined in accordance with GAAP and should not be construed as an alternative to net income (loss), as determined
in accordance with GAAP.

We use Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations as a financial measure for a number of
reasons, including:

•

in communications with our board of directors concerning our consolidated financial performance;

•

we believe it is an enterprise level performance measure commonly reported and widely used by analysts and investors; and

•

for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget.

We are reporting our Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations to exclude the impact of these items from our GAAP results because
these items are significant and we believe this information helps our investors understand the effect of these non-recurring items on our reported results and therefore, will provide a better



representation of our actual performance. Our presentation of Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected
by unusual or non-recurring items.

Set forth below is a reconciliation of Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations
(Non-GAAP) to the comparable GAAP measure:

we expect cash generated by our operations, together with existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and borrowings from the capital markets, to be sufficient to cover cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic
acquisitions, dividends and common stock repurchases. We do not rely on short-term borrowings to meet our liquidity needs.

As
of June 30, 2013, $91.8 million of the $266.0 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate
these funds. However, our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations.

On
December 28, 2012, Broadridge, the IRS and the CRA entered into an APA relating to tax years 2007 through 2012. Under the APA, a net $50.0 million of cash was transferred from two of the Company’s Canadian subsidiaries to the Broadridge
U.S. parent company during the Company’s third fiscal quarter of 2013. All tax effects pertaining to this APA were accrued in the prior fiscal year.



At June 30, 2013, the Company had $524.5 million of outstanding
Long-term debt, consisting of a $400.0 million five-year term loan facility and unsecured senior notes of $124.5 million principal amount. The senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equally with the Company’s
other senior indebtedness. Interest is payable semiannually on June 1

st

and December 1

st

each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 6.125%.

On September 22,
2011, the Company entered into a $990.0 million senior unsecured credit facility, consisting of a $490.0 million five-year term loan facility (the “Fiscal 2012 Term Loan”) and a $500.0 million five-year revolving credit facility (the
“Fiscal 2012 Revolving Credit Facility”) (collectively the “Fiscal 2012 Credit Facilities”). Borrowings under the Fiscal 2012 Credit Facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus 125 basis points. The Fiscal 2012 Revolving Credit
Facility also has an annual facility fee equal to 15 basis points, on the unused portion of the facility, which totaled $0.8 million in fees for the fiscal ended June 30, 2013, and $0.6 million in fees for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2012. The Company incurred $3.0 million in debt issuance costs to establish the Fiscal 2012 Credit Facilities, of which $0.1 million of these costs were expensed as incurred and $2.9 million of these costs have been capitalized in Other non-current
assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are being amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method, over the terms of these facilities. As of June 30, 2013 and 2012, $1.0 million and
$0.4 million, respectively, had been amortized related to the Fiscal 2012 Credit Facilities.

The Fiscal 2012 Term Loan
contains a repayment schedule that requires the Company to make minimum principal repayments on the loan of $12.3 million, on a quarterly basis, commencing with the first payment which was due on March 31, 2013, and the final payment due on
June 30, 2016, for a total repayment of $171.5 million before the balance of the loan becomes due in September 2016. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, the Company repaid $90.0 million of the $490.0 million of borrowings under the
Fiscal 2012 Term Loan. Under the terms of the Fiscal 2012 Term Loan, any prepayment of a term borrowing shall be applied to reduce the subsequent scheduled repayment, in direct order of maturity, with no prepayment penalty. At June 30, 2013,
the Company had met the repayment requirements on the Fiscal 2012 Term Loan through September 30, 2014. Under the terms of the Fiscal 2012 Term Loan agreement, as a portion of the outstanding borrowing is paid down, the total borrowing capacity
is reduced commensurately, leaving a borrowing capacity of $400.0 million at June 30, 2013. The weighted-average interest rate on the Fiscal 2012 Term Loan was 1.47% and 1.54% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

The Fiscal 2012 Credit Facilities are subject to covenants, including financial covenants consisting of a leverage ratio and
an interest coverage ratio. At June 30, 2013, the Company is not aware of any instances of any non-compliance with the financial covenants of the Fiscal 2012 Credit Facilities. The carrying value of the Fiscal 2012 Term Loan approximates fair
value at June 30, 2013 and 2012.

In May 2007, the Company completed an offering of $250.0 million in aggregate principal
amount of senior notes (the “Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes”). The Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes will mature on June 1, 2017 and bear interest at a rate of 6.125% per annum. Interest on the Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes is payable
semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes were issued at a price of 99.1% (effective yield to maturity of 6.251%). The indenture governing the Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes contains certain
covenants including covenants restricting the Company’s ability to create or incur liens securing indebtedness for borrowed money and to enter into certain sale-leaseback transactions. At June 30, 2013, the Company is not aware of any
instances of non-compliance with the financial covenants of the indenture governing the Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes. The indenture also contains covenants regarding the purchase of the Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes upon a change of control triggering event.
The Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equally with the Company’s other senior indebtedness. The Company may redeem the Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes in whole or in part at any time before their
maturity. The Company incurred $1.9 million in debt issuance costs to establish the Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes. These costs have been capitalized and are being amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective
interest method, over the ten-year term. At June 30, 2013 and June 30, 2012, the accumulated amortization related to the Senior Notes was



$1.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, the Company purchased $125.0 million principal amount of the Senior Notes (including $1.0 million
unamortized bond discount) pursuant to a cash tender offer for such notes. The fair value of the fixed-rate Senior Notes at June 30, 2013 and June 30, 2012 was $138.2 million and $137.6 million, respectively, based on quoted market
prices.

Please refer to Note 13, “Borrowings” to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion.

Based upon current and anticipated levels of operation,
management believes that the Company’s cash on hand and cash flows from operations, combined with borrowings available under credit facilities, will be sufficient to enable the Company to meet its current and anticipated cash operating
requirements, capital expenditures and working capital needs. Please refer to the discussion of net cash flows provided by financing activities in the following section for further discussion of the Company’s financing activities.

Cash Flows

Net cash
flows provided by operating activities were $270.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, a decrease of $19.7 million, compared to $290.6 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. The decrease in cash provided by
operating activities is primarily due to changes in working capital resulting from the timing of accounts receivable collections and vendor payments.

Net cash flows used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 were $52.0 million, a decrease of $58.5 million, compared to $110.5 million of net cash flows used in investing
activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. The decrease reflects lower spending of $72.4 million on acquisitions during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, slightly offset by
higher capital expenditures in the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year.

Net cash flows used in financing
activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 were $273.2 million, an increase of $184.5 million, compared to $88.7 million of net cash flows used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. The increased use of
cash reflects an increase in the purchases of common stock of $186.9 million coupled with an increase of $7.7 million in dividends paid in the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year, slightly offset by an $11.7 million increase in
proceeds from the exercise of stock options in the current fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year.

Income Taxes

Before the spin-off from our former parent company Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (“ADP”), the Company’s taxable income
was included in separate income tax returns filed with the appropriate taxing jurisdictions, except for U.S. federal and certain state and foreign jurisdictions in which the Company’s taxable income is included in the income tax returns of ADP
or an ADP affiliate. Subsequent to the spin-off, the Company files its own U.S. federal, state and foreign returns.

The
provision for income taxes is computed as if the Company filed on a combined stand-alone or separate tax return basis, as applicable. The provision for income taxes does not reflect the Company’s inclusion in the tax returns of ADP or an ADP
affiliate. Certain income taxes of the Company were paid by ADP or an ADP affiliate on behalf of the Company.

The Company,
headquartered in the U.S., is routinely examined by the IRS and is also routinely examined by the tax authorities in the U.S. states and foreign countries in which it conducts business. The tax years under audit examination vary by tax jurisdiction.
With respect to U.S. federal income taxes, the Company was a member of the ADP U.S. federal income tax consolidated group through March 30, 2007. As a member of the ADP U.S. federal income tax consolidation, the Company is included in any open
IRS examinations of ADP for



periods up to and including March 30, 2007. As a member of the ADP U.S. federal income tax consolidated group and pursuant to a tax allocation agreement between the Company and ADP, the U.S.
federal income tax payable of the Company for the period ended March 30, 2007, will be assumed by ADP. In addition, any items of income or expense successfully challenged by the IRS attributable to the business operations of the Company for tax
periods ended March 30, 2007 or earlier, will be tax liabilities assumed by ADP. Correspondingly, any items of income or expense attributable to the business operations of the Company for tax periods ended March 30, 2007 or earlier, which
are settled favorably with the IRS by ADP will remain with ADP. Accordingly, the Company has not established any tax reserves or tax assets with respect to U.S. federal income taxes for the tax periods through March 30, 2007.

The tax allocation agreement between the Company and ADP also extends to the Company’s U.S. state income tax and most foreign income
tax liabilities and tax assets. Thus, for any foreign or U.S. state income tax liabilities or tax assets relating to tax periods ended March 30, 2007 or earlier attributable to the Company’s business operations, depending on the tax
jurisdiction, ADP will either make payments directly to the appropriate tax authorities or reimburse the Company for tax payments the Company made to the tax authorities that related to tax liabilities subject to the tax allocation agreement to the
extent that such tax liabilities are in excess of amounts provided for in respect of such income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company including the Notes thereto, as of June 30, 2013. Similarly, to the extent that there are
any tax refunds attributable to the Company’s business operations in a particular tax jurisdiction for the period ended March 30, 2007 or earlier, ADP will either receive such refund directly from the appropriate tax authorities or receive
reimbursement from the Company for the refund received by the Company that is subject to the tax allocation agreement.

The
Company regularly considers the likelihood of assessments in each of the jurisdictions resulting from examinations. To the extent the Company determines it has potential tax assessment in particular tax jurisdictions and that such assessments are
not covered by the tax allocation agreement, the Company has established tax reserves which it believes are adequate in relation to the potential assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted when there is more information available, when an
event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position has expired. The resolution of tax matters should not have a material effect on the financial condition
of the Company or on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Earnings for a particular future period.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

The Company sponsors a Supplemental Officer Retirement Plan (the “Broadridge SORP”). The Broadridge SORP is a
defined benefit plan pursuant to which the Company will pay supplemental pension benefits to certain key officers upon retirement based upon the officers’ years of service and compensation. The amount charged to expense for the Broadridge SORP
was $3.4 million, $2.4 million and $1.6 million during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Broadridge SORP is currently unfunded, and the benefit obligation under this plan was $17.0 million, $15.7 million and
$11.1 million at June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

The Company also sponsors a Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan (the “Broadridge SERP”). The Broadridge SERP is a defined benefit plan pursuant to which the Company will pay supplemental pension benefits to certain key executives upon retirement based upon the executives’ years of
service and compensation. The amount charged to expense for the Broadridge SERP was $0.5 million, $0.3 million and $0.2 million during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Broadridge SERP is currently unfunded,
and the benefit obligation under this plan was $1.5 million, $1.3 million and $0.6 million at June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.



Other Post-retirement Benefit Plan

The Company sponsors an Executive Retiree Health Insurance Plan. It is a post-retirement benefit plan pursuant to which the Company helps
defray the health care costs of certain eligible key executive retirees and qualifying dependents, based upon the retirees’ age and years of service, until they reach the age of 65. The amount charged to expense under this plan was $0.2
million, $0.3 million and $0.4 million during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The plan is currently unfunded, and the benefit obligation under this plan was $3.0 million, $2.8 million and $3.1 million at
June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations to third parties as of June 30, 2013 and the effect such obligations are
expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:

(1)

These amounts represent the principal repayments of Long-term debt and are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 30, 2013, we had $524.5 million
of outstanding debt consisting of $400.0 million of a term loan facility and $124.5 million in Senior Notes. See Note 13, “Borrowings” to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
for additional information about our Borrowings and related matters. Excludes future cash payments related to interest expense as the term loan facility is variable rate and the interest payments will ultimately be determined by the rates in effect
during each period.

(2)

Includes estimated future interest payments on our long-term debt assuming a 1.5% interest rate on the term loan facility and 6.125% interest rate on the Senior Notes.

(3)

Included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment leases. We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and
equipment. The majority of our lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Certain facility and equipment leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future
adjustments in price indices. Our future operating lease obligations could change if we exit certain contracts and if we enter into additional operating lease agreements.

(4)

These amounts represent various software license agreements. We enter into software licenses in the normal course of business.

(5)

Purchase obligations relate to payments to IBM related to the IT Services Agreement entered into in March 2010 that expires in June 2022, and purchase and maintenance
agreements on our software, equipment and other assets.

(6)

Due to the uncertainty related to the timing of the reversal of uncertain tax positions, only the uncertain tax benefit related to certain settlements have been
provided in the table above. The Company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates related to the timing of the remaining unrecognized tax benefits expected to be paid. See Note 16, “Income Taxes” to our Consolidated Financial
Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail.



The Company entered into a data center outsourcing services agreement with ADP before the
Company’s spin-off from ADP in March 2007 (the “ADP Agreement”) under which ADP provided the Company with data center services. The ADP Agreement expired on June 30, 2012. The Company entered into a short-term extension of the
ADP Agreement which expired in August 2012. At June 30, 2013, the Company has no further obligation to ADP for data center services. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company recorded expenses of $5.8
million, $111.4 million and $110.4 million, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings related to the ADP Agreement.

In March 2010, the Company and IBM entered into an IT Services Agreement, under which IBM provides certain aspects of the Company’s information technology infrastructure that were previously provided
under the ADP Agreement. Under the IT Services Agreement, IBM provides a broad range of technology services to the Company including supporting its mainframe, midrange, server, network and data center operations, as well as providing disaster
recovery services. The Company has the option of incorporating additional services into the agreement over time. The migration of the data center processing from ADP to IBM was completed in August 2012. The IT Services Agreement expires on
June 30, 2022. The Company has the right to renew the initial term of the IT Services Agreement for up to one additional 12-month term. Commitments remaining under this agreement at June 30, 2013 are $496.3 million through fiscal year
2022, the final year of the contract. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company recorded expenses of $96.3 million, $24.6 million and $6.3 million, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings related to
this agreement. The Company capitalized $2.0 million and $47.0 million of costs related to the build out of the IBM data center in Other non-current assets in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Other Commercial Commitments

Immediately before the separation from ADP, certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries established unsecured, uncommitted lines of credit with banks. There were no outstanding borrowings under
these lines of credit at June 30, 2013.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

It is not the Company’s business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. However, the Company is exposed to market
risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The Company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and,
when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company uses derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. The Company was not a party to any derivative financial
instruments at June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011. In the normal course of business, the Company also enters into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the Company’s products and services.
The Company does not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties, or collateral arrangements.

ITEM 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.

1981 Marcus Avenue

Lake Success, NY 11042

We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income,
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2013. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. We also have audited the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2013, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule
and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our
audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper
management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.



In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
June 30, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements
taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2013,
based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission

NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

A. Description of Business

. Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (“Broadridge” or the
“Company”), a Delaware corporation, is a leading global provider of investor communication solutions and securities processing and business process outsourcing services to the financial services industry. The Company classifies its
continuing operations into the following two reportable segments:

•

Investor Communication Solutions

—A large portion of Broadridge’s Investor Communication Solutions business involves the processing and
distribution of proxy materials to investors in equity securities and mutual funds, as well as the facilitation of related vote processing. ProxyEdge, its innovative electronic proxy delivery and voting solution for institutional investors and
financial advisors, helps ensure the participation of the largest stockholders of many companies. Broadridge also provides the distribution of regulatory reports and corporate action/reorganization event information, as well as tax reporting
solutions that help its clients meet their regulatory compliance needs. In addition, Broadridge provides financial information distribution and transaction reporting services to both financial institutions and securities issuers. These services
include the processing and distribution of account statements and trade confirmations, traditional and personalized document fulfillment and content management services, marketing communications, and imaging, archival and workflow solutions that
enable and enhance its clients’ communications with investors. All of these communications are delivered through paper or electronic channels. In addition, Broadridge provides registered proxy services as well as registrar, stock transfer and
record-keeping services to corporate issuers.

In August 2010, Broadridge acquired NewRiver, Inc., a leader
in mutual fund electronic investor disclosure solutions. In December 2010, Broadridge acquired Forefield, Inc., a leading provider of real-time sales, education, and client communication solutions for financial institutions and their advisors. In
January 2011, Broadridge acquired Matrix Financial Solutions, Inc., an independent provider of mutual fund processing solutions for the defined contribution market.

•

Securities Processing Solutions

—Broadridge offers a suite of advanced computerized real-time transaction processing services that automate
the securities transaction lifecycle, from desktop productivity tools, data aggregation, performance reporting, and portfolio management to order capture and execution, trade confirmation, settlement, and accounting. Broadridge’s services help
financial institutions efficiently and cost-effectively consolidate their books and records, gather and service assets under management, focus on their core businesses, and manage risk. With multi-currency capabilities, its Global Processing
Solution supports real-time global trading of equity, option, mutual fund and fixed income securities in established and emerging markets. In addition, its business process outsourcing services allow broker-dealers to outsource certain
administrative functions relating to clearing and settlement, from order entry to trade matching and settlement, while maintaining their ability to finance and capitalize their businesses.

In September 2011, Broadridge acquired Paladyne Systems, Inc., a provider of buy-side technology solutions for the global investment
management industry.

B. Basis of Presentation

. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.”) (“GAAP”). These financial statements present the consolidated position of the Company. These financial statements include the entities in
which the Company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest and various entities in which the Company has investments recorded under both the cost and equity methods of accounting. Intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated.



NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. Use of Estimates.

The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes thereto. The most significant assumptions are employed in estimates used in determining the fair value and potential
impairment of goodwill, useful lives and potential impairment of intangible assets, recoverability of deferred tax assets and determination of uncertain tax positions. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

B. Revenue Recognition.

The Company’s revenues are primarily generated from fees for providing services. Revenues are
recognized for the two reportable segments as follows:

•

Investor Communication Solutions

—Revenues are generated from processing and distributing investor communications as well as vote processing
and tabulation. The Company typically enters into agreements with clients to provide services on a fee for service basis. Fees received from the rendering of services are recognized as revenue in the period in which the services have been provided
and when collectability is reasonably assured.

•

Securities Processing Solutions

—Revenues are generated from fees for transaction processing. Client service agreements often include
up-front consideration as well as a recurring fee for transaction processing. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic (“ASC”) No. 605 “Revenue Recognition” up-front implementation fees are deferred and
recognized on a straight-line basis over the longer of the respective service term of the contract or the expected customer relationship period which commences after client acceptance when the processing term begins. Fees received from processing
and outsourcing services are recognized as revenue in the period in which the services have been rendered and when collectability is reasonably assured.

C. Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Investment securities with an original maturity of 90 days or less are considered cash equivalents. The fair value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates
carrying value due to their short term nature.

D. Financial Instruments.

Substantially all of the financial
instruments of the Company other than Long-term debt are carried at fair values, or at carrying amounts that approximate fair values because of the short maturity of the instruments. The carrying value of the Company’s long-term variable-rate
term loan facility approximates fair value because these instruments reflect market changes to interest rates. The carrying value of the Company’s long-term fixed-rate senior notes represents the face value of the long-term fixed-rate senior
notes net of the unamortized discount. The fair value of the Company’s long-term fixed-rate senior notes is based on quoted market prices. See Note 13, “Borrowings,” for a further discussion of the Company’s long-term fixed-rate
senior notes.

E. Property, Plant and Equipment.

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over
the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. The estimated useful lives of assets are as
follows:

Equipment

3 to 5 years

Buildings

10 years

Furniture and fixtures

3 to 7 years

F. Available-For-Sale Equity Securities.

Available-for-sale equity securities are non-derivatives
that are reflected in Other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, unless management intends to dispose of the investment within twelve months of the end of the reporting period, in which case they are reflected in Other current
assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These investments are in entities over which the Company does not have control, joint control, or significant influence. Investments are initially recognized and carried at fair value. Unrealized holding
gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale securities are excluded



from earnings and are included in Other comprehensive income (loss), net. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in Other expenses, net and, when applicable, are
reported as a reclassification adjustment, net of tax, as a component of Other comprehensive income (loss), net.

Declines in
the fair value of available-for-sale securities below their cost that are other-than-temporary result in write-downs of the individual securities to their fair value. The related write-downs are included in earnings as realized losses. In estimating
other-than-temporary impairment losses, management considers (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and (3) the intent
and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.

G. Inventories.

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (determined on a first-in, first-out basis) or market. Inventory balances of $8.4 million and $8.6 million, consisting of forms and
envelopes used in the mailing of proxy materials to our customers, are reflected in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

H. Deferred Client Conversion and Start-Up Costs.

Direct costs that are incurred to set up or convert a client’s systems to
function with the Company’s technology are generally deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis which commences after client acceptance when the processing term begins. To the extent deferred costs exceed related implementation fee
revenues, such excess costs are amortized over the service term of the contract. Deferred costs up to the amount of the related implementation fees are recognized and capitalized over the longer of the respective service term of the contract or
expected customer relationship period. These deferred costs are reflected in Other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. See Note 11, “Other non-current assets,” for a further
discussion.

I. Deferred Data Center Costs.

Data center costs relate to conversion costs associated with our principal
data center systems and applications. Costs directly related to the activities necessary to make the data center usable for its intended purpose are deferred and amortized over the life of the contract on a straight-line basis commencing on the
date the data center has achieved full functionality. These deferred costs are reflected in Other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. See Note 11, “Other non-current
assets”.

J. Goodwill.

The Company accounts for its goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with ASC
No. 350, “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other” (“ASC No. 350”), which states that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at the reporting
unit level at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment. The Company tests for goodwill impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, using the March 31 financial statement balances. If
impairment exists, a write-down to fair value (measured by discounting estimated future cash flows) is recorded.

The Company
performs a sensitivity analysis under Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in ASC No. 350, assuming hypothetical reductions in the fair values of the reporting units. A 10% change in our estimates of projected future operating
cash flows, discount rates, or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would not result in an impairment of our goodwill.

K. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.

In accordance with ASC No. 360, “Property, Plant and Equipment—Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“ASC No. 360”), long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of
assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its expected estimated future
cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized primarily on a straight-line basis over their estimated
useful lives and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC No. 360.



L. Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions.

The assets and liabilities of the
Company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars based on exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the periods. Currency transaction gains or losses
are included in Other expenses, net. Gains or losses from balance sheet translation are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income.

M. Stock-Based Compensation.

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC No. 718, “Compensation—Stock Compensation,” by recognizing the measurement
of stock-based compensation expense in Net earnings based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. For stock options issued, the fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option pricing model.
The binomial model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, risk-free interest rate, and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities,
historical volatility of the Company’s stock price, and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk-free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at
the time of grant. The binomial model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the
period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.

N. Internal Use Software.

Expenditures for major
software purchases and software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a three- to five-year period on a straight-line basis. For software developed or obtained for internal use, the Company capitalizes these costs
in accordance with the provisions of ASC No. 350-40, “Internal Use Software.” The Company’s policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining
internal use computer software. In addition, the Company also capitalizes payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects. The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with
respect to these employees is limited to direct time spent on such projects. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance, and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred. The Company
also expenses internal costs related to minor upgrades and enhancements, as it is impractical to separate these costs from normal maintenance activities.

O. Income Taxes.

The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be determined based on the expected future income tax
consequences of events that have been recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the temporary differences are
expected to reverse.

P. Advertising Costs.

Advertising costs are expensed at the time the advertising takes place.
Selling, general and administrative expenses include advertising costs of $2.4 million, $2.0 million and $3.0 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Q. New Accounting Pronouncements.

In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting
Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2013-02, “Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income” (“ASU No. 2013-02”). ASU No. 2013-02 requires entities to provide information about
the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. In addition, entities are required to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified
out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period. For amounts not required to be
reclassified in their entirety to net income, entities are required to cross-reference to other disclosures under GAAP that provide additional



detail about those amounts. ASU No. 2013-02 will become effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014. The adoption of ASU No. 2013-02 is not expected to have a
material impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

In July 2012, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2012-02, “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other: Testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment” (“ASU No. 2012-02”). The revised standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of testing
indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment by providing entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The approach is similar to the guidance in
ASU No. 2011-08 for goodwill impairment testing. ASU No. 2012-02 is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012 and early adoption is permitted. ASU No. 2012-02
will become effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014. The adoption of ASU No. 2012-02 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial
condition.

In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (ASC Topic
350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment” (“ASU No. 2011-08”), which amends guidance for goodwill impairment testing. The amendment allows for entities to first assess qualitative factors in determining whether or not the fair value
of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. If an entity concludes from this qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then performing a two-step impairment test is
unnecessary. ASU No. 2011-08 became effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013. The adoption of ASU 2011-08 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial
condition.

In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, “Comprehensive Income (ASC Topic 220): Presentation of
Comprehensive Income” (“ASU No. 2011-05”), which amends current comprehensive income guidance. This accounting update eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of
stockholders’ equity. Instead, the Company must report comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income which contains two sections, net income and other comprehensive income, or in two separate but
consecutive statements. ASU 2011-05 is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. In December 2011, the FASB issued an update to ASU No. 2011-05. The update, ASU
No. 2011-12, “Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassification of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05” (“ASU
No. 2011-12”), deferred the effective date of certain presentation requirements within ASU No. 2011-05. ASU No. 2011-05 became effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013. The adoption of ASU 2011-05 did
not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial condition as it only required a change in the format of the Company’s presentation of Comprehensive Income.

R. Subsequent Events.

In preparing the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, in accordance with ASC No. 855,
“Subsequent Events,” the Company has reviewed events that have occurred after June 30, 2013, through the date of issuance of the Consolidated Financial Statements. During this period, the Company completed an acquisition in the
Investor Communications Solutions segment. Please see Note 20, “Subsequent Events.”

NOTE 3. EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated by dividing the Company’s Net earnings by the basic
Weighted-average shares outstanding for the periods presented.

Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur
if outstanding stock options at the presented date are exercisable and shares of restricted stock have vested.



As of June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the computation of diluted EPS did not include
2.8 million, 2.6 million and 2.4 million options to purchase Broadridge common stock, respectively, as the effect of their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

The following table sets forth the denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations:

The following table sets forth the computation of basic EPS utilizing Net earnings from continuing
operations and Net earnings for the fiscal year and the Company’s basic Weighted-average shares outstanding:

The following table sets forth the computation of diluted EPS utilizing Net earnings from continuing
operations and Net earnings for the fiscal year and the Company’s diluted Weighted-average shares outstanding:

NOTE 4. OTHER EXPENSES, NET

Other expenses, net consisted of the following:



NOTE 5. ACQUISITIONS

Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations were recorded on the Company’s Consolidated
Balance Sheets as of the respective acquisition dates based upon their estimated fair values at such dates. The results of operations of businesses acquired by the Company were included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Earnings since
their respective dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to Goodwill.

There were no acquisitions in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013.

Acquisitions completed by the Company with an aggregate purchase price of greater than $15.0 million during the fiscal years ended
June 30, 2012, and 2011, were as follows:

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, the Company acquired one
business in the Securities Processing Solutions segment:

Paladyne Systems, Inc.

In September 2011, the Company acquired Paladyne Systems, Inc. (“Paladyne”), a provider of buy-side technology solutions for the
global investment management industry. The purchase price was $72.4 million, net of cash acquired of $8.3 million. Net liabilities assumed were $15.4 million. This acquisition resulted in $64.0 million of goodwill. Intangible assets acquired,
which totaled $23.8 million, consist primarily of acquired software technology and customer relationships, which are being amortized over a seven-year life and ten-year life, respectively. The results of Paladyne’s operations were included in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Pro forma supplemental financial information is not provided as the impact of the acquisition was not material to operating results, financial position or cash flows of
the Company.

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, the Company acquired three businesses in the Investor
Communication Solutions segment. A summary of each acquisition is as follows:

NewRiver, Inc.

In August 2010, the Company acquired NewRiver, Inc. (“NewRiver”), a leader in mutual fund electronic investor disclosure
solutions. The purchase price was $77.6 million, net of cash acquired. This acquisition resulted in $47.8 million of goodwill, after post-closing adjustments for deferred taxes. Intangible assets acquired, which totaled $27.3 million, consist
primarily of customer relationships and software technology, which are being amortized over an eight-year and seven-year life, respectively. The results of NewRiver’s operations were included in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements from the date of acquisition. Pro forma supplemental financial information is not provided as the impact of the acquisition was not material to operating results, financial position or cash flows of the Company.

Forefield, Inc.

In December 2010, the Company acquired Forefield, Inc. (“Forefield”), a leading provider of real-time sales, education and client communication solutions for financial institutions and their
advisors. The purchase price was $18.3 million, net of cash acquired. This acquisition resulted in $11.1 million of goodwill, after post-closing adjustments for deferred taxes. Intangible assets acquired, which totaled $6.8 million, primarily
consist of customer relationships and software technology that are being amortized over a seven-year and a five-year life, respectively. The results of Forefield’s operations were included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
from the date of acquisition. Pro forma supplemental financial information is not provided as the impact of the acquisition was not material to operating results, financial position or cash flows of the Company.



Matrix Financial Solutions, Inc.

In January 2011, the Company acquired Matrix Financial Solutions, Inc. (“Matrix”). Matrix is a provider of mutual fund
processing services for third party administrators, financial advisors, banks and wealth management professionals. Matrix’s back-office, trust, custody, trading and mutual fund settlement services are integrated into Broadridge’s solution
suite; thereby strengthening our role as a provider of data processing and distribution channel solutions to the mutual fund industry. The purchase price was $197.6 million, net of cash acquired.

This acquisition resulted in $154.7 million of goodwill, after post-closing adjustments for deferred taxes. Goodwill primarily resulted
from the Company’s expectation of sales growth and cost synergies from the integration of Matrix’s technology and product offerings with the Company’s technology and operations to provide an expansion of products and market reach.
Intangible assets acquired, which totaled $71.5 million, consist of customer relationships, software technology, trademarks and non-compete agreements, and are being amortized over a ten-year, seven-year, five-year and three-year life, respectively.
The results of Matrix’s operations were included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Pro forma supplemental financial information is not provided as the impact of the acquisition was not material
to operating results, financial position or cash flows of the Company.

NOTE 6. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Accounting guidance on fair value measurements for certain financial assets and liabilities requires that assets and
liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:

In valuing assets and liabilities, the Company is required to maximize the use of quoted market prices
and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company calculates the fair value of its Level 1 and Level 2 instruments based on the exchange traded price of similar or identical instruments where available or based on other observable
instruments. These calculations take into consideration the credit risk of both the Company and its counterparties. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the
period.

In June 2013, the Company purchased certain available-for-sale securities in a non-public entity for which the lowest
level of significant inputs was unobservable. The Company used pricing models and similar techniques for which the determination of fair value required significant judgment by management. Accordingly, the Company classified the available-for-sale
securities as Level 3 in the table below.



The following tables set forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities at
June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period, segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy:

(1)

Money market funds includes MMDA account balances of $87.1 million and $120.9 million as of June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

The following table sets forth an analysis of changes during fiscal years 2013 and 2012 in Level 3 financial assets of the Company:

The Company did not incur any Level 3 fair value asset impairments during fiscal years 2013, 2012, and
2011. Changes in economic conditions or model based valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments between levels. The Company’s policy is to record transfers between levels if any, as of the beginning of the fiscal
year. For fiscal years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 there were no transfers between levels.

NOTE 7. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In November 2009, the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary Ridge Clearing & Outsourcing Solutions, Inc.
(“Ridge”) entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Penson Worldwide, Inc. (“PWI”) and Penson Financial Services, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of PWI (“PFSI,” referred
to together with PWI as “Penson”), to sell substantially all contracts of the securities clearing clients of Ridge to PFSI.



On June 25, 2010, the Company completed the sale of the contracts of substantially all
of the securities clearing clients of Ridge to PFSI for an aggregate purchase price of $35.2 million. The purchase price paid to Broadridge consisted of (i) a five-year subordinated note from PWI (the “Seller Note”) in the principal
amount of $20.6 million bearing interest at an annual rate equal to the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 550 basis points, and (ii) 2,455,627 shares of PWI’s common stock (representing 9.5% of PWI’s outstanding
common stock as of May 31, 2010), at the June 25, 2010 closing price of PWI’s common stock of $5.95 per share (the “Seller Shares”). The Company discontinued its securities clearing services business but continued to provide
business process outsourcing services aligned with the Securities Processing Solutions business.

Concurrent with entering
into the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company entered into an Outsourcing Services Agreement with PWI (the “Outsourcing Services Agreement”) for an eleven-year term expiring in December 2022. Under the Outsourcing Services Agreement,
Ridge provided securities processing and back-office support services to PFSI, including services for the clients acquired from Ridge and PWI’s existing clients. In January 2012, the Company completed the conversion of PWI’s U.S. and
Canadian businesses and at the time projected annual revenues under the original terms of the Outsourcing Services Agreement were approximately $50.0 million. On October 11, 2011, Broadridge entered into an amendment agreement with PWI
(the “Amendment Agreement”) to expand the scope of outsourcing support services that Ridge provided to PWI under the Outsourcing Services Agreement. The expanded services were expected to result in additional annual revenues to
Broadridge of $8.0 million over the remaining term of the Outsourcing Services Agreement. The Company expected to commence providing the expanded services to PWI at various dates, and expected these services to be completely transitioned by
July 1, 2013. Under the Amendment Agreement, in October 2011, Broadridge provided PWI with $7.0 million in consideration of the additional services and other amendments contemplated by the Amendment Agreement, and to defray the costs of
PWI associated with the conversion to the Broadridge platform. To the extent that the expanded services provided less than $8.0 million of annualized fees to Broadridge by July 1, 2013, PWI would have been obligated to pay Broadridge an
amount equal to the shortfall of such fees below $7.0 million by August 1, 2013. In addition, on October 11, 2011, PWI and Broadridge entered into an Amended and Restated Seller Note which converted the quarterly interest payment terms
under the original Seller Note to the payment of interest on the maturity date of the Seller Note effective July 1, 2011.

On March 13, 2012, Broadridge and Ridge entered into a restructuring support agreement (the “Restructuring Support
Agreement”) with Penson and certain holders of Penson’s outstanding indebtedness, which provided for proposed transactions related to the restructuring of Penson’s outstanding indebtedness (the “Restructuring”), including
the Seller Note held by Broadridge. The consummation of the Restructuring was subject to the approval and acceptance of Penson’s debt holders, among other parties, and other conditions.

The Restructuring Support Agreement provided that Penson would offer to exchange the Seller Note for newly issued shares of Penson common
stock which would have represented, together with Broadridge’s existing holdings in the Seller Shares, 9.9% of the outstanding common stock of Penson upon consummation of the Restructuring Support Agreement.

In addition, in connection with the Restructuring, Broadridge and Penson agreed to enter into an amendment to the Outsourcing Services
Agreement, which otherwise remained in place, to clarify or modify, as applicable, certain terms of the Outsourcing Services Agreement. The terms of this amendment were subject to the consummation of the Restructuring and the execution of a
definitive amendment to the Outsourcing Services Agreement, and the reasonable acceptance of the terms of such amendment by the holders of a majority in principal amount of Penson’s outstanding indebtedness. On May 17, 2012, the
Restructuring Support Agreement terminated automatically pursuant to its terms as PWI did not launch the proposed exchange offer as contemplated under the Restructuring Support Agreement.

On June 5, 2012, the Company entered into a ten-year master services agreement (the “Apex MSA”) with Apex Clearing
Corporation (“Apex Clearing”) under which Broadridge will perform outsourcing services for Apex Clearing consistent with the securities processing and back-office support services it had previously



performed for Penson. The Apex MSA was part of a series of related transactions involving Broadridge, Penson, PEAK6 Investments, L.P. (“PEAK6”) and Apex Clearing Holdings LLC
(“Apex Holdings”), an entity created by Penson and PEAK6 to provide clearing and related services to Penson’s U.S. securities correspondents. As part of the series of related transactions, Broadridge transferred ownership of its
broker-dealer subsidiary, Ridge, to Apex Holdings and Ridge was renamed Apex Clearing Corporation. Penson’s U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary, PFSI, then sold its U.S. clearing contracts to Apex Clearing. These related transactions were all
consummated on June 5, 2012.

The transfer of Ridge to Apex Holdings was made pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement
entered into by Broadridge and its subsidiary, Broadridge Securities Processing Solutions, Inc., on May 31, 2012 (the “Purchase and Sale Agreement”). Under the Purchase and Sale Agreement, Broadridge transferred ownership of Ridge,
excluding certain assets and liabilities relating to its ongoing outsourcing business, to Apex Holdings, for a purchase price approximately equal to the amount of regulatory net capital transferred with Ridge, an amount that was not material to
Broadridge. As a result of consummation of the transfer, Ridge is a wholly owned subsidiary of Apex Holdings and has been renamed Apex Clearing Corporation.

Broadridge’s fees under the Apex MSA are based on a percentage of Apex Clearing’s revenues, and the Apex MSA provides for a termination fee to be paid to Broadridge in the event it is terminated
by Apex Clearing for convenience during its term. In addition, Broadridge has agreed that in the event PFSI becomes incapable of performing transition outsourcing services for Apex Clearing under a transition services agreement between PFSI and Apex
Clearing during a transition period not to exceed 24 months, Broadridge will perform those transition outsourcing services.

In addition, on June 5, 2012, Broadridge, Ridge (prior to its transfer to Apex Holdings) and Broadridge Financial Solutions
(Canada), Inc. entered into a termination and mutual release agreement with Penson, PFSI and Penson Financial Services Canada, Inc. (“PFSC”) (the “Termination Agreement”), thereby terminating certain schedules including the U.S.
schedule (the “U.S. Schedule”) to the Outsourcing Services Agreement.

The Termination Agreement:
(i) terminated the schedules under the Outsourcing Services Agreement, including the U.S. Schedule, other than to the extent necessary to provide any transition services that may be required under the Apex MSA and for Broadridge to continue to
service Penson’s Canadian subsidiary, PFSC; and (ii) terminated, discharged and released in full Penson’s obligations, including all obligations to make principal and interest payments, under the Seller Note. The Termination Agreement
also provided that Penson and Broadridge mutually release all claims arising under the Outsourcing Services Agreement, provided that Broadridge retained claims of up to $20 million under the Outsourcing Services Agreement against PFSC while Penson
retained all of its rights under the Outsourcing Services Agreement to defend any such claims against PFSC.

On June 5,
2012, as a result of the termination of the U.S. Schedule to the Outsourcing Services Agreement, Broadridge made the determination to impair the deferred client conversion and start-up costs associated with the Outsourcing Services Agreement (the
“Deferred Costs”). The charge taken by the Company on the Deferred Costs was $47.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 (see Note 8, “Impairment and Other Charges, Net”), representing all deferred costs associated
with the Outsourcing Services Agreement with Penson. In addition, as a result of the termination of the U.S. Schedule to the Outsourcing Services Agreement on June 5, 2012, Broadridge’s obligation to pay or credit to Penson fees in the
amount of $15.1 million related to a third party vendor’s services that were replaced by the Outsourcing Services Agreement was extinguished (see Note 8, “Impairment and Other Charges, Net”).

For a period of time in fiscal years 2012 and 2011, the Company continued to generate cash flows and reported income statement activity
in Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes, associated with the securities clearing business. The activities that gave rise to these cash flows and income statement activities were transitional in nature.



The following summarized financial information related to the securities clearing services
business has been segregated from continuing operations and reported as discontinued operations:

NOTE 8. IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER CHARGES, NET

Fiscal Year 2012

Impairment and other charges, net of $74.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, included charges resulting from the termination of the U.S. schedule of the Outsourcing Services Agreement
with PWI (see Note 7, “Discontinued Operations”). The charges primarily included:

A $47.2 million impairment charge
for the deferred client conversion and start-up costs associated with the U.S. schedule of the Outsourcing Services Agreement, representing all deferred costs associated with PFSI. In reviewing these assets for impairment, management considered:
(1) the terms and conditions of the Outsourcing Services Agreement, (2) PWI’s progress toward its stated financial improvement plan and the anticipated improvement to its overall financial condition, (3) the outlook for
PWI’s business, and (4) the payment status of the Company’s trade account receivables with Penson. In addition, the Company used its best efforts to calculate the probability of the Company realizing potential weighted undiscounted
cash flows related to the Outsourcing Services Agreement based on the occurrence of a number of various scenarios. On June 5, 2012, as a result of the termination of the U.S. Schedule to the Outsourcing Services Agreement, Broadridge determined
that a material charge for impairment would be taken on the deferred costs associated with the Outsourcing Services Agreement.

A $12.5 million impairment charge for marketable securities relating to the Company’s investment in the common stock of PWI.
Included in Long-term investments during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 was the Company’s investment of 2,455,627 shares in the common stock of PWI (see Note 7, “Discontinued Operations”). In estimating other-than-temporary
impairment losses, management’s policy considered, but was not limited to, the following: (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value had been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of
the issuer, and (3) the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. Based on the Company’s review, factoring in the level of
decline in the fair value of the PWI common stock, management determined that the market value of the PWI common stock would not equal or exceed the cost basis of the Company’s investment within a reasonable period of time. After consideration
of the severity and duration of this decline in fair value, as well as the reasons for the decline in value, the Company determined that there was an “other-than-temporary” impairment (“OTTI”) related to the Company’s
investment in PWI common stock, for which the Company recorded a $12.5 million charge during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 and wrote down the cost basis of this investment to zero.



A $21.4 million impairment of a five-year subordinated note from PWI and $8.2 million of
shutdown costs. The five-year subordinated note refers to the Seller Note in the principal amount of $20.6 million issued by PWI to Broadridge as part of the consideration in the sale of the Ridge clearing contracts to Penson (see Note 7,
“Discontinued Operations”). On March 13, 2012, Broadridge and Ridge entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement with PWI and certain of its subsidiaries, which provided for proposed transactions related to the restructuring of
Penson’s outstanding indebtedness, including the Seller Note. As part of PWI’s debt restructuring, Broadridge agreed to cancel this note receivable in exchange for additional shares of PWI’s common stock, and the Company recorded a
$21.4 million charge during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, which included $0.8 million of accrued interest on the Seller Note. On May 17, 2012, the Restructuring Support Agreement terminated automatically pursuant to its terms as PWI
did not launch the proposed exchange offer as contemplated under the Restructuring Support Agreement.

These charges were
partially offset by a $15.1 million benefit associated with the extinguishment of Broadridge’s obligation to pay or credit to PWI fees related to a third party vendor’s services replaced by the Outsourcing Services Agreement. As a result
of the termination of the U.S. Schedule to the Outsourcing Services Agreement on June 5, 2012, this $15.1 million obligation was extinguished.

These charges are included in the Other segment (see Note 18, “Financial Data by Segment”).

NOTE 9. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET

Depreciation and amortization expense for Property, plant and equipment was $35.2 million, $36.3 million, and $36.1
million for the three fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Property, plant and equipment at cost and accumulated depreciation at June 30, 2013 and 2012 are as follows:

In fiscal year 2013 and 2012, Property, plant and equipment and Accumulated depreciation were each
reduced by $30.9 million and $14.8 million, respectively of asset retirements related to fully depreciated property, plant and equipment.



NOTE 10. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET

Changes in Goodwill for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 are as follows:

Foreign currency translation and other for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 includes a $9.3
million decrease to Goodwill related to the disposition of the non-controlling interest of a subsidiary related to the January 2011 acquisition of Matrix.

During fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company performed the required impairment tests of Goodwill under ASC No. 350 and determined that there was no impairment.

Intangible assets at cost and accumulated amortization at June 30, 2013 and 2012 are as follows:

In fiscal year 2013 and 2012, intangible assets and accumulated amortization were each reduced by
$4.6 million and $20.4 million, respectively of asset retirements related to fully depreciated intangibles.



Other intangibles consist primarily of purchased rights, covenants, patents, and trademarks
(acquired directly or through acquisitions). All of the intangible assets have finite lives and, as such, are subject to amortization. The weighted-average remaining useful life of the intangible assets is 5.4 years (3.9 years for software licenses
and 4.4 years for acquired software technology, 6.6 years for customer contracts and lists and 4.4 years for other intangibles). Amortization of intangibles totaled $34.2 million, $37.0 million, and $21.8 million for fiscal years 2013, 2012,
and 2011, respectively. Estimated remaining amortization expenses of the Company’s existing intangible assets for the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:

NOTE 11. OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS

Other non-current assets consisted of the following:

NOTE 12. ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES

Accrued expenses and other current liabilities consist of the following:

NOTE 13. BORROWINGS

Fiscal 2012 Credit Facilities:

On September 22, 2011, the Company entered into a $990.0 million senior
unsecured credit facility, consisting of a $490.0 million five-year term loan facility (the “Fiscal 2012 Term Loan”) and a $500.0 million five-year revolving credit facility (the “Fiscal 2012 Revolving Credit Facility”)
(collectively the “Fiscal 2012 Credit Facilities”). Borrowings under the Fiscal 2012 Credit Facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus 125 basis points. The Fiscal 2012 Revolving Credit Facility also has an annual facility fee equal



to 15 basis points, on the unused portion of the facility, which totaled $0.8 million in fees for the fiscal ended June 30, 2013, and $0.6 million in fees for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2012. The Company incurred $3.0 million in debt issuance costs to establish the Fiscal 2012 Credit Facilities, of which $0.1 million of these costs were expensed as incurred and $2.9 million of these costs have been capitalized in
Other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are being amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method, over the terms of these facilities. As of June 30, 2013 and
2012, $1.0 million and $0.4 million, respectively, had been amortized related to the Fiscal 2012 Credit Facilities.

The
Fiscal 2012 Term Loan contains a repayment schedule that requires the Company to make minimum principal repayments on the loan of $12.3 million, on a quarterly basis, commencing with the first payment which was due on March 31, 2013, and the
final payment due on June 30, 2016, for a total repayment of $171.5 million before the balance of the loan becomes due in September 2016. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, the Company repaid $90.0 million of the $490.0
million of borrowings under the Fiscal 2012 Term Loan. Under the terms of the Fiscal 2012 Term Loan, any prepayment of a term borrowing shall be applied to reduce the subsequent scheduled repayment, in direct order of maturity, with no prepayment
penalty. At June 30, 2013, the Company had met the repayment requirements on the Fiscal 2012 Term Loan through September 30, 2014. Under the terms of the Fiscal 2012 Term Loan agreement, as a portion of the outstanding borrowing is paid
down, the total borrowing capacity is reduced commensurately, leaving a borrowing capacity of $400.0 million at June 30, 2013. The weighted-average interest rate on the Fiscal 2012 Term Loan was 1.47% and 1.54% for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

The Fiscal 2012 Credit Facilities are subject to covenants, including financial
covenants consisting of a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. At June 30, 2013, the Company is not aware of any instances of any non-compliance with the financial covenants of the Fiscal 2012 Credit Facilities. The carrying value of
the Fiscal 2012 Term Loan approximates fair value at June 30, 2013 and 2012 which has been classified as a Level 2 financial liability (as defined in Note 6, “Fair Value of Financial Instruments”).

Senior Notes

: In May 2007, the Company completed an offering of $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes (the
“Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes”). The Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes will mature on June 1, 2017 and bear interest at a rate of 6.125% per annum. Interest on the Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on
June 1 and December 1 of each year. The Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes were issued at a price of 99.1% (effective yield to maturity of 6.251%). The indenture governing the Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes contains certain covenants including covenants
restricting the Company’s ability to create or incur liens securing indebtedness for borrowed money and to enter into certain sale-leaseback transactions. At June 30, 2013, the Company is not aware of any instances of non-compliance with
the financial covenants of the indenture governing the Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes. The indenture also contains covenants regarding the purchase of the Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes upon a change of control triggering event. The Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes are
senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equally with the Company’s other senior indebtedness. The Company may redeem the Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes in whole or in part at any time before their maturity. The Company incurred $1.9
million in debt issuance costs to establish the Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes. These costs have been capitalized and are being amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method, over the ten-year
term. At June 30, 2013 and June 30, 2012, the accumulated amortization related to the Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes was $1.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, the Company purchased $125.0
million principal amount of the Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes (including $1.0 million unamortized bond discount) pursuant to a cash tender offer for such notes. The fair value of the fixed-rate Fiscal 2007 Senior Notes at June 30, 2013 and
June 30, 2012 was $138.2 million and $137.6 million, respectively, based on quoted market prices and has been classified as a Level 1 financial liability (as defined in Note 6, “Fair Value of Financial Instruments”).



Available Capacity

: As of June 30, 2013, outstanding borrowings and available
capacity under the Company’s borrowing arrangements were as follows:

In addition, certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries established unsecured, uncommitted lines
of credit with banks. As of June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, no amounts were outstanding under these lines of credit.

NOTE 14. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Incentive Equity Awards

. The Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. 2007 Omnibus Award Plan (the “2007
Plan”) provides for the granting of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, phantom stock awards, stock bonuses and performance compensation awards to employees,
non-employee directors, and other key individuals who perform services for the Company. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC No. 718 which requires the measurement of stock-based compensation expense to be
recognized in Net earnings based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. In accordance with the 2007 Plan, the Company’s stock-based compensation consists of the following:

Stock Options:

Stock options are granted to employees at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company’s
common stock on the dates of grant. Stock options are generally issued under a graded vesting schedule, generally vest ratably over four years and have a term of 10 years. Compensation expense for stock options is recognized over the requisite
service period for each separately vesting portion of the stock option award.

Time-based Restricted Stock Units:

The Company has a time-based restricted stock unit (“RSU”) program under which RSUs representing the right to receive one share of the Company’s common stock for each vested RSU are granted. Time-based RSUs typically vest two and
one-half years from the date of grant. The Company records stock compensation expense for time-based RSUs on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

Performance-based Restricted Stock Units:

The Company has a performance-based RSU program under which RSUs representing the right to receive one share of the Company’s common stock for each
vested RSU are granted. RSUs vest upon the achievement, by the Company, of specific performance metrics. The Company records stock compensation expense for performance-based RSUs on a straight-line basis over the performance period, plus a
subsequent vesting period, which typically totals approximately two and one-half years from the date of grant.

Time-based
Restricted Stock:

The Company has a time-based restricted stock program under which shares of common stock can be issued to certain key employees. These shares are restricted as to transfer and in certain circumstances must be returned to the
Company at the original purchase price. The Company records stock compensation expense relating to the issuance of time-based restricted stock over the period during which the transfer restrictions exist, which is up to five years from the date of
grant. The value of the Company’s time-based restricted stock, based on market prices, is recognized as compensation expense over the restriction period on a straight-line basis. There are no shares of time-based restricted stock outstanding at
June 30, 2013.



Performance-based Restricted Stock:

The Company has performance-based restricted
stock programs under which shares of common stock can be issued to certain key employees upon the achievement of specific performance metrics. When it is probable that the performance metrics will be achieved, the Company records stock compensation
expense for performance-based restricted stock on a straight-line basis over the performance period, plus a subsequent vesting period, which typically totals approximately two and one-half years from the date of grant. Certain performance-based
equity awards granted to non-U.S. employees are to be settled in cash. The Company records a liability for these performance-based equity awards. The liability and the corresponding stock compensation expense are adjusted to reflect the
Company’s closing stock price as of the end of each reporting period. There are no shares of performance-based restricted stock outstanding at June 30, 2013.

The activity related to the Company’s incentive equity awards for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011 consisted of the following:

(a)

Stock options exercised during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011 had intrinsic values of $19.8 million, $9.7 million and $8.7 million,
respectively.

(b)

Time-based RSUs that vested during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011 had a total fair value of $22.1 million, $20.9 million and $20.6 million,
respectively. Performance-based RSUs that vested during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011 had a total fair value of $6.3 million, $6.7 million and $7.4 million, respectively.

(c)

As of June 30, 2013, the Company’s outstanding “in the money” stock options using the fiscal year-end share price of $26.58 (approximately
8.6 million shares) had an aggregate intrinsic value of $59.2 million. As of June 30, 2013, time-based RSUs and performance-based RSUs expected to vest using the fiscal year-end share price of $26.58 (approximately 1.9 million and
0.5 million shares, respectively) had an aggregate intrinsic value of $50.9 million and $14.3 million, respectively.



The tables below summarizes information regarding the Company’s outstanding and
exercisable stock options as of June 30, 2013:

Stock-based compensation expense of $27.1 million, $28.3 million, and $30.0 million was recognized in
earnings from continuing operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, as well as related tax benefits of $10.1 million, $10.4 million, and $11.3 million,
respectively.

As of June 30, 2013, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock
options and RSU awards amounted to $6.3 million and $26.3 million, respectively, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service periods of 3.2 years and 1.6 years, respectively.

In April 2013, the Company began reissuing treasury stock to satisfy stock option exercises and issuances under the Company’s RSU
awards. From time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase programs. The Company repurchased 9.7 million shares in fiscal year 2013 as compared to 2.2 million shares repurchased
in fiscal year 2012. The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit
plan activity, and market conditions.



The following table presents the assumptions used to determine the fair values of the stock
option grants using the Binomial options pricing model during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011:

NOTE 15. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

A. Defined Contribution Savings Plan.

The Company approved a Broadridge sponsored 401(k) savings plan covering
eligible full-time domestic employees of the Company. This plan provides a base contribution plus Company matching contributions on a portion of employee contributions. The costs recorded by the Company for this plan were $21.6 million, $20.4
million and $18.8 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

B. Defined Benefit
Pension Plans.

The Company sponsors a Supplemental Officer Retirement Plan (the “Broadridge SORP”). The Broadridge SORP is a defined benefit plan pursuant to which the Company will pay supplemental pension benefits to certain key
officers upon retirement based upon the officers’ years of service and compensation. The amount charged to expense for the Broadridge SORP was $3.4 million, $2.4 million and $1.6 million during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, 2012
and 2011, respectively. The Broadridge SORP is currently unfunded, and the benefit obligation under this plan was $17.0 million, $15.7 million and $11.1 million at June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

The Company also sponsors a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the “Broadridge SERP”). The Broadridge SERP is a defined
benefit plan pursuant to which the Company will pay supplemental pension benefits to certain key executives upon retirement based upon the executives’ years of service and compensation. The amount charged to expense for the Broadridge SERP was
$0.5 million, $0.3 million and $0.2 million during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Broadridge SERP is currently unfunded, and the benefit obligation under this plan was $1.5 million, $1.3 million and $0.6
million at June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

C. Other Post-retirement Benefit Plan.

The Company
sponsors an Executive Retiree Health Insurance Plan. It is a post-retirement benefit plan pursuant to which the Company helps defray the health care costs of certain eligible key executive retirees and qualifying dependents, based upon the
retirees’ age and years of service, until they reach the age of 65. The amount charged to expense under this plan was $0.2 million, $0.3 million and $0.4 million during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011,
respectively. The plan is currently unfunded, and the benefit obligation under this plan was $3.0 million, $2.8 million and $3.1 million at June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.



NOTE 16. INCOME TAXES

Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes shown below are based on the geographic location to which such
earnings are attributable.

The Provision for income taxes consists of the following components:

The Company’s effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 was 34.4% compared to
37.8% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. The change in the Company’s effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the recognition this fiscal year of certain prior year foreign tax credits, changes in the geographical mix of
income and last fiscal year’s valuation allowance on capital tax losses related to the PWI common stock and a write-off of certain state net operating loss carryforwards. The Company’s effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2012 was 37.8% compared to 36.3% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a $7.4 million one-time tax expense attributable to a valuation allowance on capital tax losses
related to the PWI common stock and a write-off of certain state net operating loss carryforwards in fiscal year ended June 30, 2012.



As of June 30, 2013, the Company had approximately $245.8 million of accumulated
earnings attributable to foreign subsidiaries. The Company considers such earnings as permanently reinvested outside the U.S. and, therefore, provides no additional taxes that could occur upon repatriation. It is not practicable to determine the
amount of income taxes payable in the event all such foreign earnings are repatriated.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net
tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. Significant
components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities at June 30, 2013 and 2012 were as follows:

The Company has estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $22.8 million as of
June 30, 2013 of which $1.9 million expires in 2017 through 2027 and of which $20.9 million has an indefinite utilization period. In addition, the Company has estimated U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $54.6
million which expire in 2018 through 2032.

The Company has recorded valuation allowances of $12.5 million and $14.7 million
at June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, because the Company does not believe that it is more likely than not that it will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to net operating and capital loss carryforwards of certain
subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings.

As of June 30, 2013 and 2012, the Company’s total amounts of
unrecognized tax benefits were $30.0 million and $62.6 million, respectively. The change relates to tax positions taken for the current and prior tax



year. The amount of the unrecognized tax benefits at June 30, 2013 that, if recognized, would affect the Company’s effective tax rate is approximately $19.1 million.

In the next twelve months, the Company expects to decrease its reserve for unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $3 million as a
result of statute of limitations expirations and certain potential state settlements.

The following table summarizes the
activity related to the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits:

The $36.7 million gross decrease for prior period tax positions related to the settlement and execution
of an Advance Pricing Agreement with the Internal Revenue Service and Canadian Revenue Authority and statute of limitation expirations.

The Company’s policy with respect to interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions is not to include them in income tax expense but include penalties as a component of other accrued
expenses and interest in interest expense. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company recognized approximately ($0.2) million, $1.0 million and $0.8 million, respectively, in interest and penalties.

The Company is continuously subject to U.S. Federal, state and foreign income tax exams for the periods beginning March 31, 2007
through June 30, 2013 with no current material examinations.

NOTE 17. CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES, AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to various claims and litigation. While the outcome of any
claim or litigation is inherently unpredictable, and with the exception of the matter described in the following paragraph, the Company believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a
material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

The Company entered into a data center
outsourcing services agreement with Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (“ADP”) before the Company’s spin-off from ADP in March 2007 (the “ADP Agreement”) under which ADP provided the Company with data center services. The ADP
Agreement expired on June 30, 2012. The Company entered into a short-term extension of the ADP Agreement which expired in August 2012. At June 30, 2013, the Company had no further obligation to ADP for data center services. For the
fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company recorded expenses of $5.8 million, $111.4 million and $110.4 million, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings related to the ADP Agreement.

In March 2010, the Company and International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”) entered into an Information Technology
Services Agreement (the “IT Services Agreement”), under which IBM provides certain aspects of the Company’s information technology infrastructure that were previously provided under the ADP Agreement. Under the IT Services Agreement,
IBM provides a broad range of technology services to the Company including supporting its mainframe, midrange, server, network and data center operations, as well as providing disaster recovery services. The Company has the option of incorporating
additional services into the agreement over time. The migration of the data center processing from ADP to IBM was completed in August 2012. The IT Services Agreement expires on June 30, 2022. The Company has the right to renew the



initial term of the IT Services Agreement for up to one additional 12-month term. Commitments remaining under this agreement at June 30, 2013 are $496.3 million through fiscal year
2022, the final year of the contract. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company recorded expenses of $96.3 million, $24.6 million and $6.3 million, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings related to
this agreement. The Company capitalized $2.0 million and $47.0 million of costs related to the build out of the IBM data center in Other non-current assets in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

The Company has obligations under the IT Services Agreement and related software maintenance agreements, various facilities and equipment
leases, and software license agreements. The total expenses related to the ADP Agreement, the IT Services Agreement and related software maintenance agreements were $102.1 million, $136.0 million, and $116.7 million in fiscal years 2013, 2012, and
2011, respectively. Total expenses related to facilities and equipment leases were $39.5 million, $43.1 million, $47.3 million in fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. Total expenses related to software license agreements were
$20.3 million, $24.3 million, and $17.3 million in fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.

The minimum
commitments under these obligations at June 30, 2013 as follows:

In addition to fixed rentals, certain leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and
contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices.

As of June 30, 2013, the Company had an
outstanding letter of credit for $1.0 million. This letter of credit was issued in May 2007 to guarantee certain claim payments to a third-party insurance company in the event the Company does not pay its portion of the claims. No amounts were drawn
on this letter of credit.

In addition, the Company has obligations under various facilities and equipment leases and software
license agreements.

It is not the Company’s business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. However, the
Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The Company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating
and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. The Company was not a party to
any derivative financial instruments as of June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In the normal course of business, the Company also enters into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the
Company’s products and services. The Company does not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties, or collateral arrangements.

cash agent, custodial and directed or non-discretionary trust services to institutional customers. MG Trust Company operates pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Colorado Division of Banking.

NOTE 18. FINANCIAL DATA BY SEGMENT

The Company classifies its operations into the following two reportable segments: (1) Investor Communication
Solutions and (2) Securities Processing Solutions. See Note 1, “Basis of Presentation” for a further discussion of the Company’s reportable segments. The primary components of “Other” are the elimination of intersegment
revenues and profits as well as certain unallocated expenses. Foreign exchange is a reconciling item between the actual foreign exchange rates and fiscal year 2013 budgeted foreign exchange rates. The prior fiscal years’ reportable segment
Revenues and Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes have been adjusted to reflect updated fiscal year 2013 budgeted foreign exchange rates, this adjustment represents a reconciling difference to Revenues and Earnings from continuing
operations before income taxes.

Certain corporate expenses, as well as certain centrally managed expenses, are allocated
based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner. Because the Company compensates the management of its various businesses on, among other factors, segment profit, the Company may elect to record certain segment related expense items of an unusual
or non-recurring nature in “Other” rather than reflect such items in segment profit.



Revenues and assets by geographic area are as follows (assets for the U.S. for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2011 includes the securities clearing activities formerly reported in the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment that were reported as assets of discontinued operations):

NOTE 19. QUARTERLY FINANCIAL RESULTS (UNAUDITED)

Summarized quarterly results of operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 are as follows:

NOTE 20. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Management
Report

Attached as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this Form 10-K are certifications of Broadridge’s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, which are required by Rule 13a-14(a) of the Exchange Act, as amended. This “Controls and Procedures” section should be read in conjunction with the Deloitte & Touche LLP audit and attestation
of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that appears in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as of June 30, 2013, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls as defined in Rule
13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2013 were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in
reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.

Management’s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting

It is the responsibility of Broadridge’s management to establish and
maintain effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance to Broadridge’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation of reliable financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Broadridge’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Broadridge; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of Broadridge are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of Broadridge; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Broadridge’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements of Broadridge.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even
those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Management has performed an assessment of the effectiveness of Broadridge’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2013 based upon criteria set forth in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

(1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management determined that Broadridge’s internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of June 30, 2013.



Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting
firm, has audited the effectiveness of the Company’s internal over financial reporting and has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which attestation report appears
in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
