PART I

ITEM I.        BUSINESS

PulteGroup, Inc.

PulteGroup, Inc. is a Michigan corporation organized in 1956.  We are one of the largest homebuilders in the United States ("U.S."), and our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “PHM”.  Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "PulteGroup", the "Company", "we", "us", and "our" used herein refer to PulteGroup, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  While our subsidiaries engage primarily in the homebuilding business, we also have mortgage banking operations, conducted principally through Pulte Mortgage LLC (“Pulte Mortgage”), and title operations.

Homebuilding, our core business, includes the acquisition and development of land primarily for residential purposes within the U.S. and the construction of housing on such land.  Homebuilding offers a broad product line to meet the needs of home buyers in our targeted markets.  Through our brands, which include Pulte Homes, Del Webb, and Centex (acquired through our merger with Centex Corporation ("Centex") in 2009), we offer a wide variety of home designs, including single-family detached, townhouses, condominiums, and duplexes at different prices and with varying levels of options and amenities to our major customer groups: entry-level, move-up, and active adult.  Over our history, we have delivered over

625,000

homes.

As of

December 31, 2013

, we conducted our operations in


markets located throughout


states.  For reporting purposes, our Homebuilding operations are aggregated into six reportable segments:

We also have a reportable segment for our financial services operations, which consist principally of mortgage banking and title operations.  Our Financial Services segment operates generally in the same geographic markets as our Homebuilding segments.

Financial information for each of our reportable business segments is included in

Note 5

to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Homebuilding Operations

Beginning in 2006 and continuing through 2011, the U.S. housing market experienced a significant decline in the demand for new homes as well as a sharp decline in overall residential real estate values.  U.S. new home sales in 2011 were the lowest since 1962.  As a result of this industry-wide downturn, we suffered net losses in each year between 2007 - 2011 from a combination of reduced operational profitability and significant asset impairments.  In response to these market conditions, we restructured our operations, including making significant reductions in employee headcount and overhead costs, and managed our business to generate cash, including curtailing our investments in inventory.  We used this positive cash flow to, among other things, increase our cash reserves as well as retire outstanding debt.

In 2012, new home sales in the U.S. increased for the first time since 2005.  In 2013, this trend continued as new home sales in the U.S. rose

16%

to approximately

428,000

homes, an approximate

40%

increase from the bottom of the housing cycle in 2011.  Additionally, mortgage interest rates remain near historic lows and the overall inventory of homes available for sale, especially new homes, remains low.  Although current industry volume remains low compared with historical levels, the improved environment and the actions we have taken contributed to our return to profitability in 2012 and a significant increase in our profitability in 2013.  In the long term, we continue to believe that the national publicly-traded builders will have a competitive advantage over local builders through their ability to leverage economies of scale, access to more reliable and lower cost financing through the capital markets, ability to control and entitle large land positions, and greater geographic and product diversification.  Among the national publicly-traded peer group, we believe that builders with broad geographic and product diversity, and sustainable capital positions will benefit as market conditions recover.  In the short-term, we expect that overall market conditions will continue to improve but that improvements will occur unevenly across our markets.  Our strategy to enhance shareholder value is centered around the following operational objectives:

•

Improving our inventory turns;

•

More effectively allocating the capital we invest in our business using a risk-based portfolio approach;

•

Enhancing revenues by:  establishing clear product offerings for each of our brands based on systematic, consumer-driven input, optimizing our pricing through the expanded use of options and lot premiums, and lessening our reliance on speculative home sales;

•

Reducing our house costs through common house plan management, value-engineering our house plans, and working with suppliers to reduce costs; and

•

Maintaining an efficient overhead structure.

Our Homebuilding operations are geographically diverse within the U.S.  As of

December 31, 2013

, we had


active communities.  Sales prices of unit closings during


ranged from less than

$100,000

to greater than

$1,200,000

, with

86%

falling within the range of

$100,000

to

$450,000

.  The average unit selling price in


was

$305,000

, compared with

$276,000

in


,

$259,000

in


,

$259,000

in


, and

$258,000

in


.  The increase in average selling price in recent years resulted from a number of factors, including improved market conditions and a shift in our sales mix toward move-up and active adult homebuyers.

Sales of single-family detached homes, as a percentage of total unit sales, were

85%

in


, compared with

81%

in


,

79%

in


,

79%

in


, and

77%

in


.  The increase in the percentage of single-family detached homes can be attributed to a weakened demand for townhouses, condominiums, and other attached housing, as prices for detached new homes have become more affordable for entry-level and active adult homebuyers.


Ending backlog, which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed, was

$1.9 billion

(

5,772

units) at

December 31, 2013

and

$1.9 billion

(

6,458

units) at

December 31, 2012

.  For each order in backlog, we have received a signed customer contract and customer deposit, which is refundable in certain instances.  Of the orders in backlog at

December 31, 2013

, substantially all are scheduled to be closed during


, though all orders are subject to potential cancellation by or final negotiations with the customer.  In the event of cancellation, the majority of our sales contracts stipulate that we have the right to retain the customer’s deposit, though we may choose to refund the deposit in certain instances.

Land acquisition and development

We acquire land primarily for the construction of homes for sale to homebuyers.  We select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing a feasibility study, which includes, among other things, soil tests, independent environmental studies and other engineering work, an evaluation of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements, and extensive market research that enables us to match the location with our product offering to targeted consumer groups.  We consider factors such as proximity to developed areas, population and job growth patterns and, if applicable, estimated development costs.  We frequently manage a portion of the risk of controlling our land positions through the use of land option contracts, which enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by land sellers until we have determined whether and when to exercise our option.  Our use of land option agreements reduces our financial risks associated with long-term land holdings.  We typically acquire land with the intent to complete sales of housing units within 24 to 36 months from the date of opening a community, except in the case of certain Del Webb active adult developments and other large master-planned projects for which the completion of community build-out requires a longer time period.  While our overall supply of controlled land is in excess of our short-term needs in many of our markets, some of our controlled land consists of long-term positions that will not be converted to home sales in the near term.  Accordingly, we remain active in our pursuit of new land investment.  We may also periodically sell select parcels of land to third parties for commercial or other development.  Additionally, we may determine that certain land assets no longer fit into our strategic operating plans.

Land is generally purchased after it is properly zoned and developed or is ready for development.  In the normal course of business, we dispose of owned land not required by our homebuilding operations through sales to appropriate end users.  Where we develop land, we engage directly in many phases of the development process, including:  land and site planning; obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals; and constructing roads, sewers, water and drainage facilities, and community amenities, such as parks, pools, and clubhouses.  We use our staff and the services of independent engineers and consultants for land development activities.  Land development work is performed primarily by independent contractors and local government authorities who construct sewer and water systems in some areas.  At

December 31, 2013

, we controlled

123,478

lots, of which

95,212

were owned and

28,266

were under option agreements.

Sales and marketing

We are dedicated to improving the quality and value of our homes through innovative architectural and community designs.  Analyzing various qualitative and quantitative data obtained through extensive market research, we stratify our potential customers into well-defined buyer groups.  Such stratification provides a method for understanding the business opportunities and risks across the full spectrum of consumer groups in each market.  Once the demands of potential buyers are understood, we link our home design and community development efforts to the specific lifestyle of each targeted consumer group.  Through our portfolio of brands, each serving unique consumer groups, we are able to provide a distinct experience to potential customers:

The move-up buyers in our Pulte Homes communities tend to place more of a premium on location and amenities.  These communities typically offer larger homes at higher price points.  Our Centex brand is targeted to entry-level buyers, and these homes tend to be smaller with product offerings geared toward lower average selling prices.  Through our Del Webb brand, we are better able to address the needs of active adults.  Our Del Webb brand offers both destination communities and “in place” communities, for those buyers who prefer to remain in their current geographic area.  These highly amenitized communities offer a variety of features, including golf courses, recreational centers, and educational classes, to the age fifty-five and over buyer to maintain an active lifestyle.  In order to make the cost of these highly amenitized communities affordable to the individual homeowner, Del Webb communities tend to be larger than entry-level or move-up communities.


We market our homes to prospective buyers through media advertising, illustrated brochures, Internet listings and link placements, mobile applications, and other advertising displays.  We have made significant enhancements in our tools and business practices to adapt our selling efforts to today's mobile customers.  In addition, our websites,

www.pulte.com, www.delwebb.com,

and

www.centex.com,

provide tools to help users find a home that meets their needs, investigate financing alternatives, communicate moving plans, maintain a home, learn more about us, and communicate directly with us.  There were approximately

9.2 million

unique visits to our websites during


, compared with approximately

8.0 million

in 2012.

To meet the demands of our various customers, we have established design expertise for a wide array of product lines.  We believe that we are an innovator in consumer-inspired home design, and we view our design capabilities as an integral aspect of our marketing strategy.  Our in-house architectural services teams and management, supplemented by outside consultants, create distinctive design features, both in exterior facades and interior options and features.  We typically offer a variety of potential options and upgrades, such as different flooring, countertop, and appliance choices, and design our base house and option packages to meet the needs of our customers as defined through rigorous market research.  Energy efficiency represents an important source of value for new homes compared with existing homes and represents a key area of focus for our home designs, including high efficiency HVAC systems and insulation, low-emissivity windows, solar power in certain geographies, and other energy-efficient features.

Typically, our sales teams, together with outside sales brokers, are responsible for guiding the customer through the sales process.  We are committed to industry-leading customer service through a variety of quality initiatives, including our customer care program, which ensures that homeowners are comfortable at every stage of the building process.  Fully furnished and landscaped model homes are generally used to showcase our homes and their distinctive design features.

Construction

The construction of our homes is conducted under the supervision of our on-site construction field managers.  Substantially all of our construction work is performed by independent subcontractors under contracts that, in many instances, cover both labor and materials on a fixed-price basis.  Using a selective process, we have teamed up with what we believe are premier subcontractors and suppliers to deliver all aspects of the house construction process.

Continuous improvement in our house construction process is a key area of focus.  We maintain efficient construction operations by using standard materials and components from a variety of sources and utilizing standard construction practices.  Beginning in 2011, we implemented an intensive effort to improve our product offerings and production processes through the following programs:

•

A 12-step product development process to introduce new features and technologies based on customer-validated data;

•

Common management of house plans in order to focus on building those house designs that customers value the most and that can be built at the highest quality and an efficient cost;

•

Value engineering our house plans to optimize house designs in terms of material content and ease of construction while still providing a clear value to the customer (value engineering eliminates items that add cost but that have little to no value to the customer); and

•

Working with our suppliers to establish the "should cost", a data driven, collaborative effort to reduce construction costs to what the associated construction activities or materials “should cost” in the market.

The availability of labor and materials at reasonable prices is becoming an increasing concern for certain trades and building materials in some markets as the supply chain responds to uneven industry growth.  Additionally, the cost of certain building materials, especially lumber, steel, concrete, copper, and petroleum-based materials, is influenced by changes in global commodity prices.  To minimize the effects of changes in construction costs, the contracting and purchasing of building supplies and materials generally is negotiated at or near the time when related sales contracts are signed with customers.  In addition, we leverage our size by actively negotiating certain materials on a national or regional basis to minimize production component cost.  We are also working to establish a more integrated system that can effectively link suppliers, contractors, and the production schedule.  However, we cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials and labor will be available at reasonable prices in the future.


Competition

The housing industry in the U.S. is fragmented and highly competitive.  While we are one of the largest homebuilders in the U.S., our national market share represented only approximately

4%

of U.S. new home sales in


.  In each of our local markets, there are numerous national, regional, and local homebuilders with whom we compete.  Additionally, new home sales have traditionally represented less than 15% of overall U.S. home sales (new and existing homes).  Therefore, we also compete with sales of existing house inventory, and any provider of housing units, for sale or to rent, including apartment operators, may be considered a competitor.  Conversion of apartments to condominiums further provides an alternative to traditional housing, as does manufactured housing.  We compete primarily on the basis of location, price, quality, reputation, design, community amenities, and our customers' overall sales and homeownership experiences.

Seasonality

Our homebuilding operating cycle historically reflected increased revenues, profitability, and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home closings.  While the challenging market conditions experienced in recent years lessened the seasonal variations of our results, we have experienced a return to a more traditional demand pattern as new orders were higher in the first half of the year and home closings increased in each quarter throughout the year.  If and when the homebuilding industry more fully recovers from the recent downturn, we believe these traditional seasonal patterns will continue.

Regulation and environmental matters

Our operations are subject to extensive regulations imposed and enforced by various federal, state, and local governing authorities.  These regulations are complex and include building codes, land zoning and other entitlement restrictions, health and safety regulations, labor practices, marketing and sales practices, environmental regulations, rules and regulations relating to mortgage financing and title operations, and various other laws, rules, and regulations.  Collectively, these regulations have a significant impact on the site selection and development of our communities, our house design and construction techniques, our relationships with customers, employees, and suppliers / subcontractors, and many other aspects of our business.  The applicable governing authorities frequently have broad discretion in administering these regulations, including inspections of our homes prior to closing with the customer in the majority of municipalities in which we operate.

Financial Services Operations

We conduct our financial services business, which includes mortgage and title operations, through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries.  Pulte Mortgage arranges financing through the origination of mortgage loans primarily for the benefit of our homebuyers.  We are a lender approved by the FHA and VA and are a seller/servicer approved by Government National Mortgage Association ("Ginnie Mae"), Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae"), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac"), and other investors.  In our conventional mortgage lending activities, we follow underwriting guidelines established by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and private investors.  We believe that our customers’ use of our in-house mortgage and title operations provides us with a competitive advantage by enabling more control over the quality of the overall home buying process for our customers while also helping us align the timing of the house construction process with our customers’ financing needs.

Operating as a captive business model primarily targeted to supporting our Homebuilding operations, the business levels of our Financial Services operations are highly correlated to Homebuilding.  During


,


, and


, we originated mortgage loans for

64%

,

67%

, and

61%

, respectively, of the homes we sold.  Such originations represented substantially all of our total originations in each of those years.  Our capture rate, which we define as loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding business excluding cash settlements, was

80.2%

in


,

81.9%

in


, and

78.5%

in


.

In originating mortgage loans, we initially use our own funds, including funds available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties, and subsequently sell such mortgage loans to third party investors in the secondary market.  Substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination, generally within 30 days.  We also sell the servicing rights for the loans we originate through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks and costs inherent in servicing loans. This strategy results in owning the servicing rights for only a short period of time.


The mortgage industry in the U.S. is highly competitive.  We compete with other mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide attractive mortgage financing to our homebuyers.  We utilize a centralized fulfillment center staffed with loan consultants to perform our mortgage underwriting, processing, and closing functions.  We believe centralizing both the fulfillment and origination of our loans improves the speed, efficiency, and quality of our mortgage operations, improving our profitability and allowing us to focus on providing attractive mortgage financing opportunities for our customers.

In originating and servicing mortgage loans, we are subject to the rules and regulations of the government-sponsored investors and other investors that purchase the loans we originate, as well as to those of other government agencies that have oversight of the government-sponsored investors or consumer lending rules in the U.S.  In addition to being affected by changes in these programs, our mortgage banking business is also affected by many of the same factors that impact our homebuilding business.

Our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements, including representations as to underwriting standards, the existence of primary mortgage insurance, and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan.  If a loan is determined to be faulty, we either repurchase the loan from the investors or reimburse the investors' losses (a "make-whole" payment).  Historically, our overall losses related to this risk were not significant.  Beginning in 2009, however, we experienced a significant increase in losses as a result of the high level of loan defaults and related losses in the mortgage industry and increasing aggressiveness by investors in presenting such claims to us.  To date, the significant majority of these losses relates to loans originated in 2006 and 2007, during which period inherently riskier loan products became more common in the mortgage origination market.  Given the volatility in the mortgage industry and the uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims, actual costs could differ from our current estimates.

Our subsidiary title insurance companies serve as title insurance agents and underwriters in select markets by providing title insurance policies and examination and closing services to buyers of homes we sell.  Historically, we have not experienced significant claims related to our title operations.

Financial Information About Geographic Areas

Substantially all of our operations are located within the U.S.  However, we have some non-operating foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, which are insignificant to our consolidated financial results.

Organization/Employees

All subsidiaries and operating units operate independently with respect to daily operations.  Homebuilding real estate purchases and other significant homebuilding, mortgage banking, financing activities, and similar operating decisions must be approved by the business unit’s management and/or corporate senior management.

At

December 31, 2013

, we employed

3,843

people, of which


people were employed in our Financial Services operations.  Except for a small group of employees in our St. Louis homebuilding division, our employees are not represented by any union.  Contracted work, however, may be performed by union contractors.  Our local and corporate management personnel are paid incentive compensation based on a combination of individual performance and the performance of the applicable business unit or the Company.  Each business unit is given a level of autonomy regarding employment of personnel, although our senior corporate management acts in an advisory capacity in the employment of subsidiary officers.  We consider our employee and contractor relations to be satisfactory.


ITEM 1A.        RISK FACTORS

Discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on Form 10-K should be read together with the risk factors set forth below. They describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are, or may become, subject.  These risks and uncertainties, together with other factors described elsewhere in this report, have the potential to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies, or prospects in a material and adverse manner.

Downward changes in general economic, real estate construction, or other business conditions could adversely affect our business or our financial results.

The residential homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors, such as the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of financing, and interest rate levels.  Adverse changes in any of these conditions generally, or in the markets where we operate, could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts, which could adversely affect the number of home deliveries we make or reduce the prices we can charge for homes, either of which could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings and would adversely affect our financial condition.

The homebuilding industry experienced a significant downturn in recent years.  Although industry conditions improved during 2012 and 2013, the overall U.S. economy, while improving, remains challenged and consumer demand in the industry remains volatile.  A deterioration in industry conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Beginning in 2006 and continuing through 2011, the U.S. housing market was unfavorably impacted by severe weakness in new home sales attributable to, among other factors, weak consumer confidence, tightened mortgage standards, significant foreclosure activity, a more challenging appraisal environment, higher than normal unemployment levels, and significant uncertainty in the global economy.  These conditions contributed to sharply weakened demand for new homes and heightened pricing pressures on new and existing home sales.  As a result of these factors, we experienced significant decreases in our revenues and profitability during the period 2007 - 2011.  We also incurred substantial impairments of our land inventory and certain other assets during this period.  During 2012 and 2013, overall industry new home sales increased, and we returned to profitability.  However, the overall demand for new homes remains below historical levels.  Accordingly, we can provide no assurances that the adjustments we have made in our operating strategy will be successful.

If the market value of our land and homes drops significantly, our profits could decrease.

The market value of land, building lots, and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions, and the measures we employ to manage inventory risk may not be adequate to insulate our operations from a severe drop in inventory values.  We acquire land for expansion into new markets and for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current markets.  If housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory, we may not be able to make profits similar to what we have made in the past, we may experience less than anticipated profits, and/or we may not be able to recover our costs when we sell and build homes.  When market conditions are such that land values are not appreciating, option arrangements previously entered into may become less desirable, at which time we may elect to forego deposits and pre-acquisition costs and terminate the agreement.  In the face of adverse market conditions, we may have substantial inventory carrying costs, we may have to write down our inventory to its fair value, and/or we may have to sell land or homes at a loss.


Our success depends on our ability to acquire land suitable for residential homebuilding at reasonable prices, in accordance with our land investment criteria.

The homebuilding industry is highly competitive for suitable land.  The availability of finished and partially finished developed lots and undeveloped land for purchase that meet our internal criteria depends on a number of factors outside our control, including land availability in general, competition with other homebuilders and land buyers for desirable property, inflation in land prices, zoning, allowable housing density, and other regulatory requirements.  Should suitable lots or land become less available, the number of homes we may be able to build and sell could be reduced, and the cost of land could be increased, perhaps substantially, which could adversely impact our results of operations.

Our long-term ability to build homes depends on our acquiring land suitable for residential building at reasonable prices in locations where we want to build.  In the past, we experienced significant competition for suitable land as a result of land constraints in many of our markets.  As competition for suitable land increases, and as available land is developed, the cost of acquiring suitable remaining land could rise, and the availability of suitable land at acceptable prices may decline.  Any land shortages or any decrease in the supply of suitable land at reasonable prices could limit our ability to develop new communities or result in increased land costs.  We may not be able to pass through to our customers any increased land costs, which could adversely impact our revenues, earnings, and margins.

We are subject to claims related to mortgage loans we sold in the secondary mortgage market that may be significant.

Our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements, including representations as to underwriting standards, the type of collateral, the existence of primary mortgage insurance, and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan.  We may also be required to indemnify underwriters that purchased and securitized loans originated by a former subsidiary of Centex for losses incurred by investors in those securitized loans based on similar breaches of representations and warranties.

To date, the significant majority of these losses relate to loans originated in 2006 and 2007, during which period inherently riskier loan products became more common in the origination market.  In 2006 and 2007, we originated $39.5 billion of loans, excluding loans originated by Centex's former subprime loan business sold by Centex in 2006.

In addition, we entered into an agreement in conjunction with the wind down of Centex’s mortgage operations, which ceased loan origination activities in December 2009, that provides a guaranty for one major investor of loans originated by Centex.  This guaranty provides that we will honor the potential repurchase obligations of Centex’s mortgage operations related to breaches of similar representations in the origination of a certain pool of loans.

The resolution of claims related to alleged breaches of these representations and warranties and repurchase claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, and could exceed existing estimates and accruals.  The repurchase liability we have recorded is estimated based on several factors, including the level of current unresolved repurchase requests, the volume of estimated probable future repurchase requests, our ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchase requests, and the severity of the estimated loss upon repurchase.  The factors referred to above are subject to change in light of market developments, the economic environment, and other circumstances, some of which are beyond our control.  Accordingly, there can be no assurance that such reserves will not need to be increased in the future.


Future increases in interest rates, reductions in mortgage availability, or other increases in the effective costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business and financial results.

A large majority of our customers finance their home purchases through mortgage loans, many through our mortgage bank.  Interest rates have been near historical lows for several years, which has made new homes more affordable.  Increases in interest rates or decreases in the availability of mortgage financing, however, could adversely affect the market for new homes.  Potential homebuyers may be less willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs or to obtain mortgage financing. Lenders may increase the qualifications needed for mortgages or adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk.  Even if potential customers do not need financing, changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing.  These factors could adversely affect the sales or pricing of our homes and could also reduce the volume or margins in our financial services business.  Our financial services business could also be impacted to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate through the various hedging strategies we employ.  These developments have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on the overall demand for new housing and thereby on the results of operations for our homebuilding business.

We also believe that the availability of FHA and VA mortgage financing is an important factor in marketing some of our homes.  The FHA has and may continue to impose stricter loan qualification standards, raise minimum down payment requirements, impose higher mortgage insurance premiums and other costs, and/or limit the number of mortgages it insures.  The liquidity provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to the mortgage industry is also critical to the housing market.  The impact of the federal government’s conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on the short-term and long-term demand for new housing remains unclear.  Any limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these agencies could adversely affect interest rates, mortgage financing, and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans.

Significant costs of homeownership include mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes, both of which are generally deductible for an individual’s federal and, in some cases, state income taxes.  Any changes to income tax laws by the federal government or a state government to eliminate or substantially reduce these income tax deductions, as has been considered from time to time, would increase the after-tax cost of owning a home.  Increases in real estate taxes by local governmental authorities also increase the cost of homeownership.  Any such increases to the cost of homeownership could adversely impact the demand for and sales prices of new homes.

Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to capital and cost of capital.

The capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility in recent years.  In many cases, the markets have exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity for issuers.  We may need credit-related liquidity for future growth and development of our business.  Without sufficient liquidity, we may not be able to purchase additional land or develop land, which could adversely affect our financial results.  At

December 31, 2013

, we had cash and equivalents of

$1.6 billion

as well as restricted cash totaling

$72.7 million

.  However, our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient, and in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all.

Another source of liquidity includes our ability to use letters of credit and surety bonds pursuant to certain performance-related obligations and as security for certain land option agreements and under various insurance programs.  The majority of these letters of credit and surety bonds are in support of our land development and construction obligations to various municipalities, other government agencies, and utility companies related to the construction of roads, sewers, and other infrastructure.  At

December 31, 2013

, we had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds totaling

$183.1 million

and

$958.3 million

, respectively.  Of these amounts outstanding,

$58.7 million

of the letters of credit were subject to cash-collateralized agreements while the remaining letters of credit and surety bonds were unsecured.  If we are unable to obtain letters of credit or surety bonds when required, or the conditions imposed by issuers increase significantly, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.


Competition for homebuyers could reduce our deliveries or decrease our profitability.

The housing industry in the U.S. is highly competitive.  We compete primarily on the basis of location, price, quality, reputation, design, community amenities, and our customers' overall sales and homeownership experiences.  We compete in each of our markets with numerous national, regional, and local homebuilders.  This competition with other homebuilders could reduce the number of homes we deliver or cause us to accept reduced margins in order to maintain sales volume.

We also compete with resales of existing or foreclosed homes, housing speculators, and available rental housing. Increased competitive conditions in the residential resale or rental market in the regions where we operate could decrease demand for new homes or unfavorably impact pricing for new homes.

Supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials could increase costs and delay deliveries.

The homebuilding industry is highly competitive for skilled labor and materials.  Additionally, the cost of certain building materials, especially lumber, steel, concrete, copper, and petroleum-based materials, is influenced by changes in global commodity prices.  Increased costs or shortages of skilled labor and/or materials could cause increases in construction costs and construction delays.  We may not be able to pass on increases in construction costs to customers and generally are unable to pass on any such increases to customers who have already entered into sales contracts as those sales contracts generally fix the price of the home at the time the contract is signed, which may be well in advance of the construction of the home.  Sustained increases in construction costs may, over time, erode our margins, and pricing competition may restrict our ability to pass on any such additional costs, thereby decreasing our margins.

Our income tax provision and tax reserves may be insufficient if a taxing authority is successful in asserting positions that are contrary to our interpretations and related reserves, if any.

Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and our reserves for federal, state, and local taxes.  In the ordinary course of business, there may be matters for which the ultimate outcome is uncertain.  Our evaluation of our tax matters is based on a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits, and effective settlement of audit issues.  Although we believe our approach to determining the tax treatment for such items is appropriate, no assurance can be given that the final tax authority review will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provision and related tax reserves.  Such differences could have a material adverse effect on our income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made and, consequently, on our financial position, cash flows, or net income for such period.

We are periodically audited by various federal, state, and local authorities regarding tax matters.  Our current audits are in various stages of completion; however, no outcome for a particular audit can be determined with certainty prior to the conclusion of the audit, appeal and, in some cases, litigation process.  As each audit is concluded, adjustments, if any, are recorded in our financial statements in the period determined.  To provide for potential tax exposures, we maintain tax reserves based on reasonable estimates of potential audit results.  If these reserves are insufficient upon completion of an audit, there could be an adverse impact on our financial position, cash flows, and results of operations.

We may not realize our deferred income tax assets.

As of

December 31, 2013

, we had deferred income tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, of

$2.2 billion

, against which we provided a valuation allowance of

$157.3 million

.  The ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income and executing tax planning strategies.  While we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred income tax assets, the valuation allowances are subject to change as facts and circumstances change.

Our ability to utilize net operating losses (“NOLs”), built-in losses (“BILs”), and tax credit carryforwards to offset our future taxable income would be limited if we were to undergo an “ownership change” within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “IRC”).  In general, an “ownership change” occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by “5-percent shareholders” (within the meaning of Section 382 of the IRC) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned by such “5-percent shareholders” at any time over the testing period.


An ownership change under Section 382 of the IRC would establish an annual limitation to the amount of NOLs, BILs, and tax credit carryforwards we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any single year.  The application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred tax assets attributable to our NOLs, BILs, and tax credit carryforwards. We have not experienced an ownership change as defined by Section 382.  To preserve our ability to utilize NOLs, BILs, and other tax benefits in the future without a Section 382 limitation, we adopted a shareholder rights plan, which is triggered upon certain transfers of our securities, and amended our by-laws to prohibit certain transfers of our securities.  Notwithstanding the foregoing measures, there can be no assurance that we will not undergo an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382.

As a result of the merger with Centex in August 2009, our ability to use certain of Centex’s pre-ownership change NOLs, BILs, and deductions is limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.  The applicable Section 382 limitation is approximately $67.4 million per year for NOLs, losses realized on built-in loss assets that are sold within 60 months of the ownership change (i.e. before August 2014), and certain deductions.  We do not believe that the Section 382 limitation will prevent the Company from using Centex's pre-ownership change NOL carryforwards and built-in losses or deductions.

The value of our deferred tax assets is also dependent upon the tax rates expected to be in effect at the time taxable income is expected to be generated.  A decrease in enacted corporate tax rates in our major jurisdictions, especially the U.S. federal corporate tax rate, would decrease the value of our deferred tax assets, which could be material.

We have significant intangible assets.  If these assets become impaired, then our profits and shareholders’ equity may be reduced.

We have significant intangible assets related to prior business combinations.  We evaluate the recoverability of  intangible assets whenever facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  If the carrying value of intangible assets is deemed impaired, the carrying value is written down to fair value.  This would result in a charge to our operating earnings.  If management’s expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly, impairments of the remaining intangible assets may occur.

Government regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects or affect our related financial services operations and adversely affect our business or financial results.

Our operations are subject to building, environmental, and other regulations imposed and enforced by various federal, state, and local governing authorities.  New housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools, parks, streets, and other public improvements.  These can cause an increase in the effective cost of our homes.

We also are subject to a variety of local, state, and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health, safety, and the environment.  The impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available. These matters may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance, remediation and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas.  More stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers, thereby increasing the cost of compliance.

Our financial services operations are also subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations.  These include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs and compliance with consumer lending and similar requirements such as disclosure requirements, prohibitions against discrimination, and real estate settlement procedures.  They also subject our operations to examination by applicable agencies, pursuant to which those agencies may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes.  For our homes to qualify for FHA or VA mortgages, we must satisfy valuation standards and site, material, and construction requirements of those agencies.

In January 2013, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau adopted new rules regarding the origination of mortgages, including the criteria for “qualified mortgages”, rules for lender practices regarding assessing borrowers’ ability to repay, and limitations on certain fees and incentive arrangements.  Such rules went into effect in January 2014.  While we have adjusted our operations to comply with the new rules, the impact such rules will have on our business remains unclear.  Additionally, many other rules required by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 have not yet been completed or implemented, which has created uncertainty in the overall U.S. financial services and mortgage industries as to their long-term impact.


Homebuilding is subject to warranty and other claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant.

As a homebuilder, we are subject to home warranty, construction defect, and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business.  We record warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built.  We have, and require our subcontractors to have, general liability, property, errors and omissions, workers compensation, and other business insurance.  These insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self-insured per occurrence and aggregate retentions, deductibles, and available policy limits.  We reserve for costs to cover our self-insured and deductible amounts under these policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits based on an analysis of our historical claims, which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported.  Because of the uncertainties inherent in these matters, we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage, our subcontractor arrangements, and our reserves will be adequate to address all our warranty and construction defect claims in the future.  Contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce, we may be responsible for applicable self-insured retentions, and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits.  Additionally, the coverage offered by and the availability of general liability insurance for construction defects are currently costly and limited.  We have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our self-insured retentions and claim reserves.  There can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted and become more costly.  Additionally, we are exposed to counterparty default risk related to our subcontractors and our and our subcontractors’ insurance carriers.

Natural disasters and severe weather conditions could delay deliveries, increase costs, and decrease demand for new homes in affected areas.

Our homebuilding operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather.  The occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new home deliveries, increase costs by damaging inventories, reduce the availability of materials, and negatively impact the demand for new homes in affected areas.  Furthermore, if our insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events, our earnings, liquidity, or capital resources could be adversely affected.

Inflation may result in increased costs that we may not be able to recoup.

Inflation can have a long-term impact on us because increasing costs of land, materials, and labor may require us to increase the sales prices of homes in order to maintain satisfactory margins.  However, we may not be able to raise home prices sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation and our margins could decrease.  In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which could have a negative impact on housing demand.

Information technology failures or data security breaches could harm our business.

We use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational activities and to maintain our business records.  Our computer systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches (through cyber-attacks from computer hackers and sophisticated organizations), catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates.  If our computer systems and our back-up systems are damaged, breached, or cease to function properly, we could suffer interruptions in our operations or unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information (including information about our homebuyers and business partners), which could require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues.

Future terrorist attacks against the U.S. or increased domestic and international instability could have an adverse effect on our operations.

A future terrorist attack against the U.S. could cause a sharp decrease in the number of new contracts signed for homes and an increase in the cancellation of existing contracts.  Accordingly, adverse developments in the war on terrorism, future terrorist attacks against the U.S., or increased domestic and international instability could adversely affect our business.

None.

ITEM 2.        PROPERTIES

Our homebuilding and corporate headquarters are located in leased office facilities at 100 Bloomfield Hills Parkway, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan 48304.  Pulte Mortgage leases its primary office facilities in Englewood, Colorado.  We also maintain various support functions in leased facilities near Phoenix, Arizona and Atlanta, Georgia.  Our homebuilding divisions and financial services branches lease office space in the geographic locations in which they conduct their day-to-day operations.

Because of the nature of our homebuilding operations, significant amounts of property are held as inventory in the ordinary course.  Such properties are not included in response to this Item.

ITEM 3.        LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are involved in various legal and governmental proceedings incidental to our continuing business operations, many involving claims related to certain construction defects.  The consequences of these matters are not presently determinable but, in our opinion, after consulting with legal counsel and taking into account insurance and reserves, the ultimate liability is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.  However, to the extent the liability arising from the ultimate resolution of any matter exceeds our estimates reflected in the recorded reserves relating to such matter, we could incur additional charges that could be significant.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

The underlying trends in U.S. housing point toward an ongoing multi-year recovery supported by favorable demographics, an improving economy, mortgage interest rates near historic lows, and limited supplies of new and existing home inventories.  Our results in 2013 showed significant improvement in the majority of our key operating metrics in the first half of the year, while demand conditions slowed for us in the second half of the year as consumers adjusted to higher home prices and a moderate rise in mortgage interest rates.  For the full year 2013, the overall improvement in market conditions, in concert with our own tactical actions, contributed to our seventh consecutive profitable quarter.  Home closings, revenues, average selling price, inventory turns, gross margin, overhead leverage, and income before income taxes all improved in 2013 compared with 2012.

Our net new orders declined

10%

in 2013 compared with 2012.  A lower number of active communities contributed to the decline in net new orders as we maintained

14%

fewer active communities in 2013 compared with 2012.  The lower active community count resulted from the close-out of a number of long-term projects and is consistent with our more disciplined land investment strategy.  In addition, demand slowed in the second half of 2013 in response to higher home prices and a rise in mortgage interest rates.  We will continue to calibrate sales pace in each community to improve our gross margins and maximize returns on invested capital.  We expect that this approach will continue to result in a moderation in our net new order volume in the short-term relative to overall growth in the U.S. homebuilding industry and relative to certain of our competitors.  While we believe higher mortgage interest rates are inevitable and may have a moderating effect on demand and pricing, we believe this impact will be outweighed in the long-term by other factors driving increased sales volume as overall new home sales in the U.S. remain low compared with historical levels.

The significant improvements reported for 2013 also allowed us to continue to enhance our financial position.  We generated significant positive cash flow from operations in each of the last two years via a combination of improved profitability and inventory management.  Our improved financial position provided additional flexibility to retire debt early and increase our planned future investments in new communities, while also paying a dividend and selectively repurchasing our common shares.  Specifically, we accomplished the following during 2013:

•

Increased our total cash balance to $1.7 billion;

•

Proactively reduced our outstanding debt by $461.4 million;

•

Increased our existing share repurchase authorization by $250.0 million and retired $127.7 million of shares;

•

Reinstated a quarterly dividend;

•

Increased our land investment spending to support future growth; and

•

Lowered our ratio of debt to total capitalization from 53.4% to 30.7%, in part due to the reversal of a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.

In the short-term, we will continue to focus on maximizing our operating margins, despite the possibility of rising house cost pressures from material and labor prices, by using our existing land assets more effectively, allocating capital more effectively, and aggressively controlling unsold "spec" inventory to enhance our balance sheet.  We believe we have positioned ourselves to deliver improved long-term returns.  In planning for the longer term, we continue to maintain confidence that we are in the early stages of a broad, sustainable recovery in the U.S. new home market.  While the U.S. macroeconomic environment continues to face challenges and each local market will experience varying results, we are continuing to pursue strategic land positions that meet our underwriting requirements in well-positioned submarkets and believe that sustained execution of our strategy will continue to result in increased profits and improved returns on invested capital over the housing cycle.


The following is a summary of our operating results by line of business ($000's omitted, except per share data):

•

The Homebuilding income (loss) before income taxes included charges related to the following items ($000's omitted):

For additional information on each of the above, see the applicable Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our Homebuilding operating results in 2013 and 2012 improved significantly from the loss experienced in 2011 due to higher revenues and gross margins, improved overhead leverage, and lower charges, as listed in the above table.

•

The increase in Financial Services income in


compared with


and


was primarily due to lower loan loss reserves.  There were

no

such loss reserves in


compared with

$49.0 million

in


and

$59.3 million

in


(see

Note 13

to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  Additionally, loan origination volume increased in 2013 compared with 2012 and 2011, primarily as the result of increased Homebuilding closings.  These favorable factors were partially offset in 2013 by margin compression caused by heightened competition in the mortgage industry compared with 2012.

•

The income tax benefit in


includes

$2.1 billion

related to the reversal of substantially all of the valuation allowance previously recorded against our deferred tax assets. See

Note 10

to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The income tax benefits in


and


were attributable primarily to the favorable resolution of certain federal and state income tax matters.


Homebuilding Operations

The following is a summary of income (loss) before income taxes for our Homebuilding operations ($000’s omitted):

(a)

Includes the amortization of capitalized interest.  Home sale cost of revenues also includes land impairments of

$2.9 million

,

$13.4 million

, and

$15.9 million

for


,


, and


, respectively.

(b)

Includes net realizable value adjustments for land held for sale of

$3.6 million

,

$1.5 million

, and

$9.8 million

for


,


, and


, respectively.

(c)

SG&A includes costs associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters totaling

$15.0 million

in 2013.

(d)

Includes the write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs for land option contracts we elected not to pursue of

$3.1 million

,

$2.3 million

, and

$10.0 million

in


,


, and


, respectively, and net losses related to the redemption of debt totaling

$26.9 million

,

$32.1 million

, and

$5.6 million

in


,


, and


, respectively.  Also includes charges resulting from a contractual dispute related to a previously completed luxury community totaling

$41.2 million

in 2013 and goodwill impairment charges of

$240.5 million

in


.

(e)

Net new order dollars represent a composite of new order dollars combined with other movements of the dollars in backlog related to cancellations and change orders.


Home sale revenues

Home sale revenues for 2013 were higher than 2012 by

$871.9 million

, or

19%

.  The increase was attributable to an

11%

increase in the average selling price combined with an

8%

increase in closings.  The increase in average selling price occurred in substantially all of our local markets and reflects an ongoing shift in our revenue mix toward move-up and active adult buyers and improved market conditions that have allowed for increased sale prices, including higher levels of house options and lot premiums.  The increase in closings reflected improved consumer demand for new homes in the majority of our local markets.

Home sale revenues for 2012 were higher than 2011 by

$601.7 million

, or

15%

.  The increase was attributable to a

7%

increase in the average selling price combined with an

8%

increase in closings.  The increase in average selling price reflected a shift in our revenue mix toward move-up and active adult buyers and improved market conditions.  The increase in closings was concentrated primarily in our North and Southwest segments.

Home sale gross margins

Home sale gross margins were

20.5%

in


, compared with

15.8%

in


and

12.8%

in


.  Gross margins during


and


benefited from lower land impairments of

$2.9 million

and

$13.4 million

, respectively, compared with

$15.9 million

in


.  Excluding the impact of land impairments and capitalized interest amortization, adjusted home sale gross margins improved to

25.2%

in


from

20.9%

in


and

17.9%

in


(see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for a reconciliation of adjusted home sale gross margins). The gross margin improvement was broad-based as substantially all of our operating divisions experienced higher gross margins in


compared with the prior year periods.  These improved gross margins reflect a combination of factors, including an improved pricing environment, shifts in the product mix of homes closed toward move-up and active adult buyers, better alignment of our product offering with consumer demand, and contributions from our strategic pricing and house cost reduction initiatives.

Land sales

We periodically elect to sell parcels of land to third parties in the event such assets no longer fit into our strategic operating plans or are zoned for commercial or other development.  Land sale revenues and their related gains or losses vary between periods, depending on the timing of land sales and our strategic operating decisions.  Land sales had margin contributions of

$9.9 million

,

$11.8 million

, and

$23.6 million

in


,


, and


, respectively.  These margin contributions included net realizable value adjustments related to land held for sale totaling

$3.6 million

,

$1.5 million

, and

$9.8 million

in


,


, and


, respectively.

SG&A

SG&A as a percentage of home sale revenues dropped to

10.5%

in


from

11.3%

in


, and

13.2%

in


.  The gross dollar amount of our SG&A increased

$54.0 million

, or

11%

, in


compared with


. SG&A includes

$15.0 million

of employee severance, retention, relocation, and related costs attributable to our previously announced relocation of our corporate headquarters. The remaining increases in gross overhead dollars were primarily due to variable costs related to the higher revenue volume combined with higher incentive compensation accruals resulting from the Company's improved operating performance.

The gross dollar amount of our SG&A decreased

$5.1 million

,  or

1%

, in


compared with


due to improved overhead leverage, partially offset by higher incentive compensation resulting from our improved operating results.

Equity in (earnings) loss of unconsolidated entities

Equity in (earnings) loss of unconsolidated entities was

$(1.0) million

,

$(3.9) million

, and

$(3.2) million

for


,


, and


, respectively.  The majority of our unconsolidated entities represent land development joint ventures.  As a result, the timing of income and losses varies between periods depending on the timing of transactions and circumstances specific to each entity.


Other expense, net

Other expense, net includes the following ($000’s omitted):

For additional information on each of the above, see the applicable Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Miscellaneous expense, net includes charges of

$41.2 million

in 2013 resulting from a contractual dispute related to a previously completed luxury community, and

$5.1 million

in 2012 and

$17.1 million

in 2011 related to the write-down of notes receivable.

Interest income, net

Interest income, net for 2013 decreased from the prior year based on the level of invested cash balances and low returns on invested cash available in the current interest rate environment.

Net new orders

Net new orders decreased

10%

in


compared with


primarily due to selling from

14%

fewer active communities in 2013 (


at

December 31, 2013

) combined with slowed demand in the second half of 2013 in response to higher home prices and a rise in mortgage interest rates.  The cancellation rate (canceled orders for the period divided by gross new orders for the period) was unchanged from 2012 to 2013 at

15%

.  Ending backlog units, which represent orders for homes that have not yet closed, decreased

11%

at

December 31, 2013

compared with

December 31, 2012

, due to the decrease in net new orders but only decreased by

2%

over the prior year period as measured in dollars due to the increase in our average selling price.

Net new order levels increased

25%

in 2012 compared with 2011 while selling from

4%

fewer active communities in 2012 (we had


active communities at

December 31, 2012

).  The cancellation rate was

15%

in 2012 compared with

19%

in 2011.  Ending backlog units increased

65%

at

December 31, 2012

compared with

December 31, 2011

due to the decrease in net new orders.

Homes in production

The following is a summary of our homes in production at

December 31, 2013

and


:

The number of homes in production at

December 31, 2013

was

10%

lower than at

December 31, 2012

.  The reduced level of homes in production is consistent with our lower active community count and our inventory management strategies.  Reducing our reliance on sales of spec homes is a component of our strategic pricing and inventory turns objectives, so we have focused on reducing the level of our spec home inventory, especially our completed specs ("final specs").


Controlled lots

The following is a summary of our lots under control at

December 31, 2013

and


:

Of our controlled lots,

95,212

and

103,060

were owned and

28,266

and

16,815

were under land option agreements at

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively.  While competition for well-positioned land has increased, we

continue to pursue strategic land positions that meet our underwriting requirements while also using our existing land assets more effectively.

The remaining purchase price under our land option agreements totaled

$1.4 billion

at

December 31, 2013

.  These land option agreements, which generally may be canceled at our discretion and in certain cases extend over several years, are secured by deposits and pre-acquisition costs totaling

$91.0 million

, of which only

$4.5 million

is refundable.


Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This report contains information about our home sale gross margins reflecting certain adjustments.  This measure is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the SEC's rules and should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, the comparable GAAP financial measure as a measure of our operating performance.  Management and our local divisions use this measure in evaluating the operating performance of each community and in making strategic decisions regarding sales pricing, construction and development pace, product mix, and other daily operating decisions.  We believe it is a relevant and useful measures to investors for evaluating our performance through gross profit generated on homes delivered during a given period and for comparing our operating performance to other companies in the homebuilding industry.  Although other companies in the homebuilding industry report similar information, the methods used may differ.  We urge investors to understand the methods used by other companies in the homebuilding industry to calculate gross margins and any adjustments thereto before comparing our measure to that of such other companies.

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the GAAP financial measure that management believes to be most directly comparable ($000's omitted):

(a)

Write-offs of capitalized interest related to land impairments are reflected in capitalized interest amortization.

Homebuilding Segment Operations

Our homebuilding operations represent our core business.  Homebuilding offers a broad product line to meet the needs of  homebuyers in our targeted markets.  As of

December 31, 2013

, we conducted our operations in


markets located throughout


states.  For reporting purposes, our Homebuilding operations are aggregated into six reportable segments:

We also have a reportable segment for our financial services operations, which consist principally of mortgage banking and title operations.  The Financial Services segment operates generally in the same markets as the Homebuilding segments.


The following table presents selected financial information for our reportable Homebuilding segments:

(a)

Other homebuilding includes the amortization of intangible assets, amortization of capitalized interest, and other items not allocated to the operating segments. Other homebuilding also includes: losses on debt retirements totaling

$26.9 million

,

$32.1 million

, and

$5.6 million

in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively; costs associated with the previously announced relocation of our corporate headquarters totaling

$15.4 million

in 2013; and charges resulting from a contractual dispute related to a previously completed luxury community totaling

$41.2 million

in 2013.

Financial Services Operations

We conduct our Financial Services operations, which include mortgage and title operations, through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries.  In originating mortgage loans, we initially use our own funds, including funds available pursuant to credit agreements with either third parties or with the Company.  Substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination, generally within 30 days.  We also sell the servicing rights for the loans we originate through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks and costs inherent in servicing loans.  This strategy results in owning the servicing rights for only a short period of time.  Operating as a captive business model primarily targeted to supporting our Homebuilding operations, the business levels of our Financial Services operations are highly correlated to Homebuilding.  Our Homebuilding customers continue to account for substantially all loan production.  We believe that our capture rate, which represents loan originations from our Homebuilding operations as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our Homebuilding operations, excluding cash closings, is an important metric in  evaluating the effectiveness of our captive mortgage business model.  The following table presents selected financial information for our Financial Services operations ($000’s omitted):


Revenues

Total Financial Services revenues during


decreased

12%

compared with


.  The decrease was primarily attributable to lower revenues per loan resulting from the increased competitiveness in the mortgage industry that occurred in 2013.  The decline in revenues per loan more than offset the higher loan origination volume.  Interest income, which is included in mortgage operations revenues, was moderately higher in


than in


due to the increase in loan originations.

Total Financial Services revenues during


increased

56%

compared with


due to a

19%

increase in loan origination volumes, an increase in average loan size, and improved loan pricing.  The increase in loan origination volumes was due to a higher capture rate, higher Homebuilding closing volumes, and fewer cash sales.  Interest income, which is included in mortgage operations revenues, was moderately higher in


than in


due to the increase in loan originations.

In recent years, the mortgage industry has experienced a significant overall tightening of lending standards and a shift toward agency production and fixed rate loans versus adjustable rate mortgages (“ARMs”) and unconventional loans.  The substantial majority of loan production during


,


, and


consisted of fixed rate loans, the majority of which are prime, conforming loans. The shift toward agency fixed-rate loans has contributed to profitability as such loans generally result in higher profitability due to higher servicing values and structured guidelines that allow for expense efficiencies when processing the loan. Additionally, historically low interest rates and the challenging regulatory environment has contributed to profitability by reducing the overall level of pricing competition in the market.  Recently, however, competition has increased in the industry, partially as the result of the mortgage industry's lower refinancing volume.  We expect this increased level of competition, and more challenging pricing environment, to continue for the foreseeable future.

Loan origination liabilities

Our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements, including representations as to underwriting standards, the existence of primary mortgage insurance, and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan.  If a loan is determined to be faulty, we either repurchase the loan from the investors or reimburse the investors' losses (a “make-whole” payment).

In recent years, we experienced a significant increase in losses as a result of the high level of loan defaults and related losses in the mortgage industry and increasing aggressiveness by investors in presenting such claims to us.  To date, the significant majority of these losses relates to loans originated in 2006 and 2007, during which period inherently riskier loan products became more common in the mortgage origination market.  During


and


, we recorded additional provisions for losses as a change in estimate primarily to reflect projected claim volumes in excess of previous estimates.  Losses related to loan origination liabilities totaled

$49.0 million

and

$59.3 million

in


and


, respectively, and are reflected in Financial Services expenses.  There were

no

such losses in


.  Given the volatility in the mortgage industry and the uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims, actual costs could differ from our current estimates.   See our

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

and

Note 13

to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.

We entered into an agreement in conjunction with the wind down of Centex's mortgage operations, which ceased loan origination activities in December 2009, that provides a guaranty for one major investor of loans originated by Centex.  This guaranty provides that we will honor the potential repurchase obligations of Centex's mortgage operations related to breaches of representations and warranties in the origination of a certain pool of loans.  Other than with respect to this pool of loans, our contractual repurchase obligations are limited to our mortgage subsidiaries, which are included in non-guarantor subsidiaries (see

Note 14

for a discussion of non-guarantor subsidiaries).


The mortgage subsidiary of Centex also sold loans to a bank for inclusion in residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBSs”) issued by the bank.  In connection with these sales, Centex's mortgage subsidiary entered into agreements pursuant to which it may be required to indemnify the bank for losses incurred by investors in the RMBSs arising out of material errors or omissions in certain information provided by the mortgage subsidiary relating to the loans and loan origination process.  In 2011, the bank notified us that it has been named defendant in two lawsuits alleging various violations of federal and state securities laws asserting that untrue statements of material fact were included in the registration statements used to market the sale of two RMBS transactions which included

$162 million

of loans originated by Centex's mortgage subsidiary.  Neither Centex's mortgage subsidiary nor the Company is named as a defendant in these actions. We cannot yet quantify Centex's mortgage subsidiary's potential liability as a result of these indemnification obligations.  We do not believe, however, that these matters will have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial position, or cash flows of the Company.  We are aware of six other RMBS transactions with similar indemnity provisions that include an aggregate

$116 million

of loans, and we are not aware of any current or threatened legal proceedings regarding those transactions.

Income before income taxes

The increased income before income taxes for


as compared with


was due to higher origination volumes and lower loss reserves related to loans originated in previous years, partially offset by less favorable loan pricing.

The income before income taxes for


as compared with the loss before income taxes in the prior year period was due to higher origination volumes, improved loan pricing, and lower loss reserves related to loans originated in previous years.

Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate is affected by a number of factors, the most significant of which are the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets and changes in our unrecognized tax benefits.  Due to the effects of these factors, our effective tax rates in


,


, and


are not correlated to the amount of our income or loss before income taxes.  The income tax benefit for


resulted from the reversal of substantially all of the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets while the income tax benefits for


and


resulted primarily from the favorable resolution of certain federal and state income tax matters.

We evaluate our deferred tax assets each period to determine if a valuation allowance is required based on whether it is "more likely than not" that some portion of the deferred tax assets would not be realized. The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income during future periods. We conduct our evaluation by considering all available positive and negative evidence.

Our income tax benefit for


includes

$2.1 billion

related to the reversal of substantially all of the valuation allowance previously recorded against our deferred tax assets.  In the third quarter of 2013, we evaluated the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and determined that the valuation allowance against substantially all of our federal deferred tax assets and a significant portion of our state deferred tax assets was no longer required.  When a change in valuation allowance is recognized in an interim period, a portion of the valuation allowance to be reversed must be allocated to the remaining interim periods. Accordingly, a portion of the remaining valuation allowance was reversed in the fourth quarter of 2013.  The components of the valuation allowance remaining at

December 31, 2013

relate primarily to state net operating losses that have not met the "more likely than not" realization threshold.

The principal positive evidence that led to the reversal of the valuation allowance in


included: (1) our emergence from a three-year cumulative loss in 2013; (2) the significant positive income we generated during 2012 and 2013, including seven consecutive quarters of pretax income as of December 31, 2013; (3) continued improvements in 2013 over recent years in other key operating metrics, including revenues, gross margin, and overhead leverage; (4) our forecasted future profitability; (5) improvement in our financial position; and (6) significant evidence that conditions in the U.S. housing industry are more favorable than in recent years and our belief that conditions will continue to be favorable over the long-term.  The following provides a further summary of the principal evidence considered in


:

•

Recent operating results

:  We generated significant pretax income in 2012 and 2013.  This included generating pretax income in seven consecutive quarters.  Excluding asset impairments, we have been profitable in nine out of the last ten quarters.  As a result of this improved profitability, we exited a three-year cumulative loss position in 2013, which had been a significant piece of negative evidence prior to 2013.


•

Future operating results

:  We have a strong backlog of orders that, combined with other factors, provides evidence of our ability to continue to be profitable for 2014 and beyond.  Based on detailed projections from each of our business units, we expect pretax earnings growth in the future, even if sales volumes remain at existing levels.

•

Financial position

:  We continue to generate significant cash flow from operations and had

$1.6 billion

of unrestricted cash and equivalents at

December 31, 2013

.  We have used our capital to both invest in our business and reduce our financial leverage.  During 2013, we increased our authorized investments in new communities via land acquisition and development, retired significant amounts of debt prior to the stated maturity dates, increased our authorized and actual common share repurchases, and reinstated a common share dividend.

•

Recovery period for deferred tax assets

:  For federal income tax purposes, we are allowed to carryforward net operating losses for 20 years and apply such losses to future taxable income to realize our federal deferred tax assets.  We believe that we will realize all of our federal net operating losses and will be able to absorb substantially all federal deductible temporary differences as they reverse in future years.

•

Operating actions taken

:  We have taken specific actions in recent years to improve our homebuilding operations, including: restructuring our overhead costs to align with current and projected volumes; improving inventory turns, including significant reductions in speculative home inventory; implementation of a robust risk-based portfolio approach to land acquisition approvals; monetization of under performing land assets; enhancing revenues through more strategic pricing, including establishing clear product offerings for each of our targeted consumer groups based on consumer-driven input, expanding the use of house options and lot premiums, and lessening our reliance on speculative home sales; and reducing our house construction costs through common house plan management, value-engineering house plans, and "should costing" our construction costs with our suppliers.

•

Risk of future asset impairments

:  The frequency and magnitude of asset impairments has decreased dramatically in recent years as assets have been written-down or sold and as industry conditions have improved.  While we remain at risk of future impairments if industry conditions worsen or if our strategy related to certain assets changes, we believe it unlikely that any future asset impairments would be at levels similar to those experienced during the U.S. housing industry downturn.

•

Sales trends

:  Our home closings and home sale revenues increased

8%

and

19%

, respectively, in


compared with 2012.  We also have a strong backlog of orders that is amongst the highest in the U.S. homebuilding industry at

$1.9 billion

as of

December 31, 2013

.  Additionally, the gross margin of orders within our backlog improved significantly from 2012 to 2013.  While our net new order units declined

10%

in


compared with 2012, this resulted primarily from an expected reduction in the number of our active communities, which are down

14%

at

December 31, 2013

from December 31, 2012.  The reduction in active communities and the lower level of net new orders is consistent with our expectations.

•

U.S. housing industry outlook

:  Various housing indices have shown significant improvement in recent periods.  U.S. single family new home sales of 306,000 in 2011 were at the lowest level since 1962, a drop of 76% from the 2005 cyclical peak of 1.3 million.  In 2013 and 2012, U.S. new home sales increased

16%

and 20%, respectively, over the prior year periods.  The general consensus among industry analysts is that new home sales will increase significantly in each of the next several years.  These forecasts are generally consistent with the 25-year average of approximately 735,000 annual new home sales.  New home sales experienced volatility in the second half of 2013 period as consumers adjusted to higher home prices and an increase in mortgage interest rates.  While we believe that higher interest rates are inevitable and may have a moderating effect on demand and pricing, we believe this impact will be outweighed by the other factors driving increased sales activity as overall new home sales remain low compared with historical levels.  Ultimately, we believe that any sustained rise in interest rates will be indicative of a stronger macroeconomic environment that will support a continued recovery in the homebuilding industry.

After careful evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence, and giving more weight to objectively verifiable evidence over more subjective evidence, we concluded as of September 30, 2013 and again as of

December 31, 2013

, that it was "more likely than not" that substantially all of our federal deferred tax assets and a significant portion of our state deferred tax assets would be realized.  Even if industry conditions weaken from current levels, we believe we will be able to adjust our operations to sustain long-term profitability.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

We finance our land acquisition, development, and construction activities and financial services operations by using internally-generated funds supplemented by credit arrangements with third parties and capital market financing.  We routinely monitor current and expected operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate accessing other available financing sources, including revolving bank credit and securities offerings.  Based on our current financial condition and credit relationships, we believe that our operations and borrowing resources are sufficient to provide for our current and foreseeable capital requirements.  However, we continue to evaluate the impact of market conditions on our liquidity and may determine that modifications are appropriate.

At

December 31, 2013

, we had unrestricted cash and equivalents of

$1.6 billion

and senior notes of

$2.1 billion

.  We also had restricted cash balances of

$72.7 million

, the substantial majority of which related to cash serving as collateral under certain letter of credit facilities.   Other financing sources include various letter of credit facilities and surety bond arrangements.

We follow a diversified investment approach for our cash and equivalents by maintaining such funds with a diversified portfolio of banks within our group of relationship banks in high quality, highly liquid, short-term investments, generally money market funds and federal government or agency securities.  We monitor our investments with each bank and do not believe our cash and equivalents are exposed to any material risk of loss.  However, there can be no assurances that losses of principal balance on our cash and equivalents will not occur.

Our ratio of debt to total capitalization, excluding our Financial Services debt, was

30.7%

at

December 31, 2013

, and

8.0%

net of cash and equivalents, including restricted cash.

During


, we retired prior to their scheduled maturity dates

$461.4 million

of senior notes. We recorded losses related to these transactions totaling

$26.9 million

.  Losses on these transactions included the write-off of unamortized discounts, premiums, and transaction fees and are reflected in other expense, net.  During


and 2011, we retired senior notes totaling

$592.4 million

and

$323.9 million

, respectively.

Credit agreements

We maintain separate cash-collateralized letter of credit agreements with a number of financial institutions.  Letters of credit totaling

$58.7 million

were outstanding under these agreements at

December 31, 2013

.  Under these agreements, we are required to maintain deposits with these financial institutions in amounts approximating the letters of credit outstanding.  Such deposits are included in restricted cash.

We also maintain an unsecured letter of credit facility that expires in

September 2014

.  This facility permits the issuance of up to

$150.0 million

of letters of credit for general corporate purposes in support of any wholly-owned subsidiary.  Letters of credit totaling

$124.4 million

were outstanding under this facility at

.

Pulte Mortgage

Pulte Mortgage provides mortgage financing for the majority of our home closings by utilizing its own funds and funds made available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties or through intercompany borrowings.  Pulte Mortgage uses these resources to finance its lending activities until the mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market, which generally occurs within 30 days.

Pulte Mortgage maintains a master repurchase agreement (the “Repurchase Agreement”) with third party lenders that expires in

September 2014

.  Effective January 2014, Pulte Mortgage voluntarily reduced the borrowing capacity under the Repurchase Agreement from

$150.0 million

to

$99.8 million

subject to certain sublimits.  We reduced the borrowing capacity in order to lower associated fees during seasonally low volume periods when the additional capacity is unnecessary.  Borrowings under the Repurchase Agreement are secured by residential mortgage loans available-for-sale.  The Repurchase Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants applicable to Pulte Mortgage, including quantitative thresholds related to net worth, net income, and liquidity.  At

December 31, 2013

, Pulte Mortgage had

$105.7 million

outstanding under the Repurchase Agreement and was in compliance with all of its covenants and requirements.  While there can be no assurances that the Repurchase Agreement can be renewed or replaced on commercially reasonable terms upon its expiration, we believe we have adequate liquidity to meet Pulte Mortgage's anticipated financing needs.


Stock repurchase programs

In July 2013, we increased our common share repurchase authorization to

$352.3 million

of common shares.  In


, we repurchased

7.2 million

shares under the repurchase authorization for a total of

$118.1 million

.  There were

no

repurchases under these programs during


or


.  Such repurchases are reflected as a reduction of common stock and retained earnings.  At

December 31, 2013

, we had remaining authorization to purchase

$234.3 million

of common shares.

Dividends

We reinstated our quarterly cash dividend in July 2013.  During 2013, we declared three cash dividends of $0.05 per common share each.

Cash flows

Operating activities

Our net cash provided by operating activities in


was

$881.1 million

, compared with

$760.1 million

and

$17.3 million

in


and


, respectively.  Generally, the primary drivers of our cash flow from operations are profitability and changes in inventory levels.  Our positive cash flow from operations for 2013 was primarily due to our income before income taxes of

$527.8 million

combined with a net decrease in inventories of

$265.1 million

and a reduction of

$28.4 million

in residential mortgage loans available-for-sale.  The inventory decrease resulted from a reduction in homes in production and lower land inventory consistent with the decline in the number of our active communities.

Our positive cash flow from operations for 2012 was primarily due to our net income of

$206.1 million

combined with a net decrease in inventories of

$455.2 million

.  The inventory decrease resulted from lower reinvestment in land inventory combined with a significant reduction in spec homes in production, partially offset by an increase in sold homes in production.

The net losses for 2011 were largely the result of non-cash asset impairments and insurance reserve adjustments, so the cash flows from operations primarily related to changes in working capital.  Our positive cash flow from operations in 2011 was primarily the result of a net decrease in inventories combined with income tax refunds, net of payments, of

$62.2 million

offset by financing Pulte Mortgage's lending operations, which reduced cash flows from operations by

$52.8 million

in 2011.

Investing activities

Investing activities are generally not a significant source or use of cash for us.  Net cash used in investing activities totaled

$46.0 million

in


, compared with net cash provided by investing activities of

$9.7 million

in


and net cash used in investing activities of

$93.6 million

in


.  The use of cash from investing activities in


was primarily due to

$28.9 million

of capital expenditures, a

$12.3 million

increase in residential mortgage loans held for investment, and a

$4.2 million

increase in the restricted cash we are required to maintain under our letter of credit facilities.

The positive cash flow from investing activities in


was primarily due to a

$28.7 million

decrease in the restricted cash we are required to maintain under our letter of credit facilities, which resulted from a reduction in letters of credit outstanding, offset by capital expenditures and investments in unconsolidated entities.

The use of cash from investing activities for 2011 was due to

$83.2 million

of restricted cash we were required to maintain related to our letter of credit facilities, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment related to the consolidation of certain facilities.


Financing activities

Net cash used in financing activities was

$659.6 million

in


, compared with net cash used of

$448.2 million

and

$324.0 million

in


and


, respectively.  During the last three years, we significantly reduced our outstanding senior notes through a variety of transactions, including scheduled maturities, open market repurchases, early redemptions as provided within indenture agreements, and tender offers.  Completion of these transactions required the use of

$479.8 million

,

$618.8 million

, and

$321.1 million

of cash in


,


, and


, respectively.  During 2013, we also repaid

$33.1 million

of borrowings under the Repurchase Agreement due to the lower balance of mortgages available-for-sale.  We borrowed

$138.8 million

under the Repurchase Agreement in 2012, the year in which it was put in place.  During 2011, we used internal funds to finance Pulte Mortgage's operations, the effects of which are reflected in cash flows from operating activities.  Cash used in financing activities for 2013 also reflects funds used to repurchase common shares and pay dividends, partially offset by funds provided by the issuance of common shares in connection with employee stock option exercises.

Inflation

We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of inflation because of higher land and construction costs.  Inflation may also increase our financing costs.  In addition, higher mortgage interest rates affect the affordability of our products to prospective homebuyers.  While we attempt to pass on to our customers increases in our costs through increased sales prices, market forces may limit our ability to do so.  If we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs, or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly, our revenues, gross margins, and net income could be adversely affected.

Seasonality

We experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry.  Historically, we have experienced increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home closings

.

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments

The following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of

December 31, 2013

:

(a)

Represents principal and interest payments related to our senior notes.

(b)

Represents limited recourse collateralized financing arrangements and related interest payments.

(c)

We do not have any payments due in connection with capital lease or long-term purchase obligations.

We are subject to certain obligations associated with entering into contracts (including land option contracts) for the purchase, development, and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business.  Option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise our option, which may serve to reduce our financial risks associated with long-term land holdings.  At

December 31, 2013

, we had

$91.0 million

of deposits and pre-acquisition costs relating to option agreements to acquire

28,266

homesites with a remaining purchase price of

$1.4 billion

.  We expect to acquire the majority of these lots within the next two years and the remainder thereafter.


At

December 31, 2013

, we had

$173.3 million

of gross unrecognized tax benefits and

$33.1 million

of related accrued interest and penalties.  We are currently under examination by various taxing jurisdictions and anticipate finalizing the examinations with certain jurisdictions within the next twelve months.  However, the final outcome of these examinations is not yet determinable.  The statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for tax years

.

The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of

December 31, 2013

:

(a)

$150.0 million

of the

$208.7 million

in 2014 represents the capacity of our unsecured letter of credit facility, of which

$124.4 million

was outstanding at

December 31, 2013

, while the remaining

$58.7 million

in


represents letters of credit outstanding under our cash-collateralized letter of credit agreements.

(b)

Represents the capacity of the Repurchase Agreement, of which

$105.7 million

was outstanding at December 31, 2013, and which expires in September 2014.  Effective January 2014, we voluntarily reduced the capacity from $150 million to $99.8 million.

(c)

The above table excludes an aggregate

$958.3 million

of surety bonds, which typically do not have stated expiration dates.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We use letters of credit and surety bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our homebuilding projects.  The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related homebuilding projects.  If the obligations related to a project are ongoing, annual extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a year-to-year basis.  At

December 31, 2013

, we had outstanding letters of credit of

$183.1 million

.  Our surety bonds generally do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed.  These bonds, which approximated

$1.0 billion

at

December 31, 2013

, are typically outstanding over a period of approximately three to five years.  Because significant construction and development work has been performed related to the applicable projects but has not yet received final acceptance by the respective counterparties, the aggregate amount of surety bonds outstanding is in excess of the projected cost of the remaining work to be performed.

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land option agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future.  At

December 31, 2013

, these agreements had an aggregate remaining purchase price of

$1.4 billion

.  Pursuant to these land option agreements, we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future, usually at predetermined prices.  In certain instances, we are required to record the land under option as if we own it.  At

December 31, 2013

, we recorded assets of

$24.0 million

as land, not owned, under option agreements.

At

December 31, 2013

, aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures was

$12.4 million

, of which our proportionate share was

$4.4 million

.  Of this amount, we provided limited recourse guaranties for

$0.8 million

at

December 31, 2013

.  See

Note 6

to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.


Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see

Note 1

of our Consolidated Financial Statements).  Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.  In preparing these consolidated financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements, giving due regard to materiality.

Revenue recognition

Homebuilding

– Homebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. In situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by Pulte Mortgage, our wholly-owned mortgage subsidiary, and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment, the profit on such sale is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a third-party investor has been completed.  If there is a loss on the sale of the property, the loss on such sale is recognized at the time of closing.

Financial Services

– Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors.  Servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance, or a contracted set fee in the case of certain sub-servicing arrangements, and are credited to income when related mortgage payments are received or the sub-servicing fees are earned.  Loan origination fees, commitment fees, and certain direct loan origination costs are recognized as incurred.  Expected gains and losses from the sale of residential mortgage loans and their related servicing rights are included in the measurement of written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through Financial Services revenues at the time of commitment.  Subsequent changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in Financial Services revenues as they occur.  Interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold.  Loans are placed on non-accrual status once they become greater than 90 days past due their contractual terms.  Subsequent payments received are applied according to the contractual terms of the loan.

Inventory

Inventory is stated at cost unless the carrying value is determined to not be recoverable, in which case the affected inventory is written down to fair value.  Cost includes land acquisition, land development, and home construction costs, including interest, real estate taxes, and certain direct and indirect overhead costs related to development and construction.  For those communities for which construction and development activities have been idled, applicable interest and real estate taxes are expensed as incurred.  Land acquisition and development costs are allocated to individual lots using an average lot cost determined based on the total expected land acquisition and development costs and the total expected home closings for the community.  The specific identification method is used to accumulate home construction costs.

We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories.  Each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development.  Interest expense is allocated over the period based on the timing of home closings.

Cost of revenues includes the construction cost, average lot cost, estimated warranty costs, and commissions and closing costs applicable to the home.  The construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home, plus an appropriate accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted construction costs.  This accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared with the amount accrued, and adjustments are made if needed.  Total community land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared with actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete.  The development cycles for our communities range from under one year to in excess of ten years for certain master planned communities.  Adjustments to estimated total land acquisition and development costs for the community affect the amounts costed for the community’s remaining lots.

We record valuation adjustments on land inventory when events and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired and when the cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts.  For communities that demonstrate indicators of impairment, we compare the expected undiscounted cash flows for these communities to their carrying value.  For those communities whose carrying values exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows, we calculate the fair value of the community.  Impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of the community’s inventory is less than its carrying value.


We generally determine the fair value of each community’s inventory using a combination of discounted cash flow models and market comparable transactions, where available.  These estimated cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates related to expected average selling prices and sale incentives, expected sales paces and cancellation rates, expected land development and construction timelines, and anticipated land development, construction, and overhead costs.  Such estimates must be made for each individual community and may vary significantly between communities.  Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, the significant volatility in demand for new housing, and the long life cycles of many communities, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates.

Residential mortgage loans available-for-sale

In accordance with ASC 825, “Financial Instruments” (“ASC 825”), we use the fair value option for our residential mortgage loans available-for-sale.  Election of the fair value option for residential mortgage loans available-for-sale allows a better offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions.  Changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in revenues as they occur.

Loan origination liabilities

Our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements, including representations as to underwriting standards, the existence of primary mortgage insurance, and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan.  If a loan is determined to be faulty, we either repurchase the loan from the investors or reimburse the investors' losses (a “make-whole” payment).

In recent years, we experienced a significant increase in losses related to repurchase requests as a result of the high level of loan defaults and related losses in the mortgage industry and increasing aggressiveness by investors in presenting such claims to us.  To date, the significant majority of these losses relates to loans originated in 2006 and 2007, during which period inherently riskier loan products became more common in the mortgage origination market.  In 2006 and 2007, we originated

$39.5 billion

of loans, excluding loans originated by Centex's former subprime loan business sold by Centex in 2006.  Because we generally do not retain the servicing rights to the loans we originate, information regarding the current and historical performance, credit quality, and outstanding balances of such loans is limited.  Estimating these loan origination liabilities is further complicated by uncertainties surrounding numerous external factors, such as various macroeconomic factors (including unemployment rates and changes in home prices), actions taken by third parties, including the parties servicing the loans, and the U.S. federal government in its dual capacity as regulator of the U.S. mortgage industry and conservator of the government-sponsored enterprises commonly known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which own or guarantee the majority of mortgage loans in the U.S.

Most requests received to date relate to make-whole payments on loans that have been foreclosed. Requests undergo extensive analysis to confirm the exposure, attempt to cure any identified defect, and, when necessary, determine our liability.  We establish liabilities for such anticipated losses based upon, among other things, the level of current unresolved repurchase requests, the volume of estimated probable future repurchase requests, our ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchase requests, and the severity of the estimated loss upon repurchase.  Determining these estimates and the resulting liability requires a significant level of management judgment.  We are generally able to cure or refute over

60%

of the requests received from investors such that we do not believe repurchases or make-whole payments will ultimately be required.  For those requests that we believe will result in repurchases or make-whole payments, actual loss severities are expected to approximate

50%

of the outstanding principal balance.

During


and


, we recorded provisions for losses as a change in estimate primarily to reflect projected claim volumes in excess of previous estimates.  Given the ongoing volatility in the mortgage industry, our lack of visibility into the current status of the review process of loans by investors, the claim volumes we continue to experience, changes in values of underlying collateral over time, and other uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims, actual costs could differ from our current estimates.  For example, if the total number of loans we are required to repurchase is ultimately 10% lower or higher than our current estimates, the amount of future losses could decrease or increase by approximately $13.0 million.


Intangible assets

We have recorded intangible assets related to tradenames acquired with the Centex merger completed in 2009 and the Del Webb merger completed in 2001, which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives.  The carrying values and ultimate realization of these assets are dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use.  If we determine that the carrying values of intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists.  If the carrying values of the intangible assets exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows, then we measure impairment as the difference between the fair value of the asset and the recorded carrying value.  To date, no impairments relating to tradenames have been recorded.  However, if our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly, or if our strategy related to the use of the intangible assets changes, the related intangible assets may become impaired.

Allowance for warranties

Home purchasers are provided with a limited warranty against certain building defects, including a one-year comprehensive limited warranty and coverage for certain other aspects of the home’s construction and operating systems for periods of up to ten years.  We estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized.  Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and the cost per claim.  We periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability for each geographic market in which we operate and adjust the amounts as necessary.  Actual warranty costs in the future could differ from our estimates.

Self-insured risks

We maintain, and require our subcontractors to maintain, general liability insurance coverage.  We also maintain builders' risk, property, errors and omissions, workers compensation, and other business insurance coverage.  These insurance policies protect us against a portion of the risk of loss from claims.  However, we retain a significant portion of the overall risk for such claims either through policies issued by our captive insurance subsidiaries or through our own self-insured per occurrence and aggregate retentions, deductibles, and claims in excess of available insurance policy limits.

Our general liability insurance includes coverage for certain construction defects.  While construction defect claims can relate to a variety of circumstances, the majority of our claims relate to alleged problems with siding, plumbing, foundations and other concrete work, windows, roofing, and heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems.  The availability of general liability insurance for the homebuilding industry and its subcontractors has become increasingly limited, and the insurance policies available require companies to maintain higher per occurrence and aggregate retention levels.  In certain instances, we may offer our subcontractors the opportunity to purchase insurance through one of our captive insurance subsidiaries or to participate in a project-specific insurance program provided by the Company.  Policies issued by the captive insurance subsidiaries represent self-insurance of these risks by the Company.  This self-insured exposure is limited by reinsurance policies that we purchase.  General liability coverage for the homebuilding industry is complex, and our coverage varies from policy year to policy year.  Our insurance coverage requires a per occurrence deductible up to an overall aggregate retention level.  Beginning with the first dollar, amounts paid on insured claims satisfy our per occurrence and aggregate retention obligations.  Any amounts incurred in excess of the occurrence or aggregate retention levels are covered by insurance up to our purchased coverage levels.  Our insurance policies, including the captive insurance subsidiaries' reinsurance policies, are maintained with highly-rated underwriters for whom we believe counterparty default risk is not significant.

At any point in time, we are managing over 1,000 individual claims related to general liability, property, errors and omission, workers compensation, and other business insurance coverage.  We reserve for costs associated with such claims (including expected claims management expenses) on an undiscounted basis at the time product revenue is recognized for each home closing and evaluate the recorded liabilities based on actuarial analyses of our historical claims.  The actuarial analyses calculate an estimate of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses, including estimates for incurred but not reported losses ("IBNR").  IBNR represents losses related to claims incurred but not yet reported plus development on reported claims.  These estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors, including changes in claims reporting and resolution patterns, third party recoveries, insurance industry practices, the regulatory environment, and legal precedent.  State regulations vary, but construction defect claims are reported and resolved over an extended period often exceeding ten years.  In certain instances, we have the ability to recover a portion of our costs under various insurance policies or from our subcontractors or other third parties.  Estimates of such amounts are recorded when recovery is considered probable.


The recorded reserves include loss estimates related to both (i) existing claims and related claim expenses and (ii) IBNR and related claim expenses.  Liabilities related to IBNR and related claim expenses represented approximately

78%

and

74%

of the total general liability reserves, which represent the vast majority of the total recorded reserves, at

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively.  The actuarial analyses that determine the IBNR portion of reserves consider a variety of factors, including the frequency and severity of losses, which are based on our historical claims experience supplemented by industry data.  The actuarial analyses of the reserves also consider historical third party recovery rates and claims management expenses.

Adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs.  Because the majority of our recorded reserves relates to IBNR, adjustments to reserve amounts for individual existing claims generally do not impact the recorded reserves materially.  However, changes in the frequency and timing of reported claims and the estimates of specific claim values can impact the underlying inputs and trends utilized in the actuarial analyses, which could have a material impact on the recorded reserves.

Our recorded reserves for all such claims totaled

$668.1 million

and

$721.3 million

at

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively, the vast majority of which relate to general liability claims.  Because of the inherent uncertainty in estimating future losses related to these claims, actual costs could differ significantly from estimated costs.  Based on the actuarial analyses performed, we believe the range of reasonably possible losses related to these claims is $600 million to $750 million.   While this range represents our best estimate of our ultimate liability related to these claims, due to a variety of factors, including those factors described above, there can be no assurance that the ultimate costs realized by us will fall within this range.

Income taxes

The provision for income taxes is calculated using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.  In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.  In determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns, judgment is required.  Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations or financial position.

Unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized for financial statement purposes.  We follow the provisions of ASC 740, “Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”), which prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.  Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions.  Our evaluations of tax positions consider a variety of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in law, correspondence with taxing authorities, and effective settlements of audit issues.  Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in income tax expense (benefit) in the period in which the change is made.  Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense (benefit).


ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are subject to interest rate risk on our rate-sensitive financings to the extent long-term rates decline. The following tables set forth, as of

December 31, 2013

and


, our rate-sensitive financing obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted-average interest rates, and estimated fair value ($000’s omitted).

Derivative instruments and hedging activities

Pulte Mortgage is exposed to market risks from commitments to lend, movements in interest rates, and canceled or modified commitments to lend.  A commitment to lend at a specific interest rate (an interest rate lock commitment) is a derivative financial instrument (interest rate is locked to the borrower).  The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor.  We are generally not exposed to variability in cash flows of derivative instruments for more than approximately


days.  In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float.

In order to reduce these risks, we use other derivative financial instruments, principally cash forward placement contracts on mortgage-backed securities and whole loan investor commitments, to economically hedge the interest rate lock commitment.  We enter into one of the aforementioned derivative financial instruments upon accepting interest rate lock commitments.  Changes in the fair value of interest rate lock commitments and the other derivative financial instruments are recognized in Financial Services revenues.  We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long-term mortgage rates of 50, 100, and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results.

PULTEGROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    Summary of significant accounting policies

Basis of presentation

PulteGroup, Inc. is one of the largest homebuilders in the U.S., and our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “PHM”.  Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "PulteGroup", the "Company", "we", "us", and "our" used herein refer to PulteGroup, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  While our subsidiaries engage primarily in the homebuilding business, we also have mortgage banking operations, conducted principally through Pulte Mortgage LLC (“Pulte Mortgage”), and title operations.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and include the accounts of PulteGroup, Inc. and all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries and variable interest entities in which PulteGroup, Inc. is deemed to be the primary beneficiary.  All significant intercompany accounts, transactions, and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Subsequent events

We evaluated subsequent events up until the time the financial statements were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

Cash and equivalents

Cash and equivalents include institutional money market investments and time deposits with a maturity of three months or less when acquired.  Cash and equivalents at

December 31, 2013

and


also included

$3.7 million

and

$8.1 million

, respectively, of cash from home closings held in escrow for our benefit, typically for less than five days, which are considered deposits in-transit.

Restricted cash

We maintain certain cash balances that are restricted as to their use.  Restricted cash consists primarily of deposits maintained with financial institutions under certain cash-collateralized letter of credit agreements (see

Note 7

).  The remaining balances relate to certain other accounts with restrictions, including customer deposits on home sales that are temporarily restricted by regulatory requirements until title transfers to the homebuyer.

Investments in unconsolidated entities

We have investments in a number of unconsolidated entities, including joint ventures, with independent third parties.  Some of these unconsolidated entities purchase, develop, and/or sell land and homes.  The equity method of accounting is used for unconsolidated entities over which we have significant influence; generally this represents ownership interests of at least 20% and not more than 50%.  Under the equity method of accounting, we recognize our proportionate share of the profits and losses of these entities.  Certain of these entities sell land to us.  In these situations, we defer the recognition of profits from such activities until the time the related homes are sold.  The cost method of accounting is used for investments in which we have less than a 20% ownership interest and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence.


PULTEGROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

We evaluate our investments in unconsolidated entities for recoverability in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 323, “Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures” (“ASC 323”).  If we determine that a loss in the value of the investment is other than temporary, we write down the investment to its estimated fair value.  Any such losses are recorded to equity in (earnings) loss of unconsolidated entities in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additionally, each unconsolidated entity evaluates its long-lived assets, such as inventory, for recoverability in accordance with ASC 360-10, “Property, Plant, and Equipment – Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“ASC 360-10”).  Our proportionate share of any such impairments is also recorded to equity in (earnings) loss of unconsolidated entities in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Evaluations of recoverability under both ASC 323 and ASC 360-10 are primarily based on projected cash flows.  Due to uncertainties in the estimation process and the significant volatility in demand for new housing, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates.  See

Note 6

.

Notes receivable

In certain instances, we may accept consideration for land sales or other transactions in the form of a note receivable.  Such receivables are reported net of allowance for credit losses within other assets.  The following represents our notes receivable and related allowance for credit losses ($000’s omitted):

We also record other receivables from various parties in the normal course of business, including amounts due from municipalities, insurance companies, and vendors.  Such receivables are generally reported in other assets.  See

Residential mortgage loans available-for-sale

in

Note 1

for a discussion of our receivables related to mortgage operations.

Intangible assets

Intangible assets consist of tradenames acquired in connection with the 2009 acquisition of Centex Corporation ("Centex") and the 2001 acquisition of Del Webb Corporation ("Del Webb").  These intangible assets were valued at the acquisition date and are being amortized over


-year lives.  The acquired cost and accumulated amortization of our intangible assets were

$259.0 million

and

$122.9 million

, respectively, at

December 31, 2013

, and

$259.0 million

and

$109.8 million

, respectively, at

December 31, 2012

.  Amortization expense totaled

$13.1 million

in


,


, and


and is expected to be

$13.1 million

in each of the next five years.

The ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use.  If we determine that the carrying values of intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists.  If the carrying values of the intangible assets exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows, then we measure impairment as the difference between the fair value of the asset and the recorded carrying value.  There were

no

impairments of tradenames during


,


, or


.

Property and equipment, net, and depreciation

Property and equipment are recorded at cost.  Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.  Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method based upon estimated useful lives as follows: model home furniture -

two

years; office furniture and equipment -

three

to

ten

years; and leasehold improvements - life of the lease.  Property and equipment are included in other assets and totaled

$53.1 million

net of accumulated depreciation of

$182.0 million

at

December 31, 2013

and

$44.2 million

net of accumulated depreciation of

$190.1 million

at

December 31, 2012

.  Depreciation expense totaled

$18.5 million

Employee benefits

We maintain defined contribution retirement plans that cover substantially all of our employees.  Company contributions to these plans were suspended during 2011 but reinstated in 2012.  Company contributions pursuant to the plans totaled

$11.0 million

and

$9.4 million

in


and


, respectively.

Other expense, net

Other expense, net consists of the following ($000’s omitted):

(a)

Includes charges of

$41.2 million

in


resulting from a contractual dispute related to a previously completed luxury community (see

Note 13

) and

$5.1 million

in 2012 and

$17.1 million

in 2011 related to the write-down of notes receivable.

Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders (the “Numerator”) by the weighted-average number of common shares, adjusted for unvested shares of restricted stock (the “Denominator”) for the period.  Computing diluted earnings per share is similar to computing basic earnings per share, except that the Denominator is increased to include the dilutive effects of stock options, unvested restricted stock, and other potentially dilutive instruments.  Any stock options that have an exercise price greater than the average market price are considered to be anti-dilutive and are excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation.  Our earnings per share excludes

9.6 million

and

16.6 million

stock options and other potentially dilutive instruments in


and


, respectively.  All stock options, unvested restricted stock, and other potentially dilutive instruments were excluded from the calculation during 2011 due to the net loss recorded during the period.

In accordance with ASC 260 "Earnings Per Share" ("ASC 260"), the two-class method determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to an earnings allocation formula that adjusts the Numerator for dividends or dividend equivalents and participation rights in undistributed earnings.  Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method.  The Company's outstanding restricted stock awards and deferred shares are considered participating securities.  The following table presents the earnings per share of common stock ($000's omitted, except per share data):


PULTEGROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Stock-based compensation

We measure compensation cost for restricted stock and restricted stock units at fair value on the grant date.  Fair value is determined based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date.  We recognize compensation expense for restricted stock and restricted stock units, the majority of which cliff vest at the end of three years, ratably over the vesting period.  For share-based awards containing performance conditions, we recognize compensation expense ratably over the vesting period when it is probable that the stated performance targets will be achieved and record cumulative adjustments in the period in which estimates change.  We measure compensation cost for stock options at fair value on the grant date and recognize compensation expense on the graded vesting method over the vesting period.  The graded vesting method provides for vesting of portions of the overall awards at interim dates and results in greater expense in earlier years than the straight-line method.  The fair value of our stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model.  Compensation expense related to our share-based awards is included in selling, general, and administrative expense, except for a small portion recognized in Financial Services expenses.  See

Note 9

.

Income taxes

The provision for income taxes is calculated using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.  In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.  In determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns, judgment is required.  Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations or financial position.


PULTEGROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized for financial statement purposes.  We follow the provisions of ASC 740, “Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”), which prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.  Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions.  Our evaluations of tax positions consider a variety of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in law, correspondence with taxing authorities, and effective settlements of audit issues.  Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in income tax expense (benefit) in the period in which the change is made.  Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense (benefit).  See

Note 10

.

Homebuilding revenue recognition

Homebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer.  In situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by Pulte Mortgage and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment, the profit on such sale is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a third-party investor has been completed.  If there is a loss on the sale of the property, the loss on such sale is recognized at the time of closing.  The amount of such deferred profits were not material at either

December 31, 2013

or

December 31, 2012

.

Sales incentives

When sales incentives involve a discount on the selling price of the home, we record the discount as a reduction of revenue at the time of house closing.  If the sales incentive requires us to provide a free product or service to the customer, the cost of the free product or service is recorded as cost of revenues at the time of house closing.  This includes the cost related to optional upgrades and seller-paid financing costs, closing costs, homeowners’ association fees, or merchandise.

Inventory

Inventory is stated at cost unless the carrying value is determined to not be recoverable, in which case the affected inventory is written down to fair value.  Cost includes land acquisition, land development, and home construction costs, including interest, real estate taxes, and certain direct and indirect overhead costs related to development and construction.  For those communities for which construction and development activities have been idled, applicable interest and real estate taxes are expensed as incurred.  Land acquisition and development costs are allocated to individual lots using an average lot cost determined based on the total expected land acquisition and development costs and the total expected home closings for the community.  The specific identification method is used to accumulate home construction costs.

Cost of revenues includes the construction cost, average lot cost, estimated warranty costs, and commissions and closing costs applicable to the home.  The construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home, plus an appropriate accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted construction costs.  This accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared with the amount accrued, and adjustments are made if needed.  Total community land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared with actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete.  The development cycles for our communities range from under one year to in excess of ten years for certain master planned communities.  Adjustments to estimated total land acquisition and development costs for the community affect the amounts costed for the community’s remaining lots.


PULTEGROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

We record valuation adjustments on land inventory when events and circumstances indicate that the related community may be impaired and when the cash flows estimated to be generated by the community are less than its carrying amount.  Such indicators include gross margin or sales paces significantly below expectations, construction costs or land development costs significantly in excess of budgeted amounts, significant delays or changes in the planned development for the community, and other known qualitative factors.  Communities that demonstrate potential impairment indicators are tested for impairment by comparing the expected undiscounted cash flows for the community to its carrying value.  For those communities whose carrying values exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows, we estimate the fair value of the community.  Impairment charges are recorded if the fair value of the community's inventory is less than its carrying value.  We determine the fair value of a community's inventory using a combination of market comparable land transactions, where available, and discounted cash flow models.  These estimated cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates related to expected average selling prices, expected sales paces, expected land development and construction timelines, and anticipated land development, construction, and overhead costs.  The assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models are specific to each community.  Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, the significant volatility in demand for new housing, and the long life cycles of many communities, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates.  See

Note 4

.

Land held for sale

We periodically elect to sell parcels of land to third parties in the event such assets no longer fit into our strategic operating plans or are zoned for commercial or other development.  Land held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell.  In determining the value of land held for sale, we consider recent offers received, prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions, and other factors.  See

Note 4

.

Land option agreements

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land option agreements in order to procure land for the construction of homes in the future.  Pursuant to these land option agreements, we generally provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future, usually at predetermined prices.  Such contracts enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties or unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether and when to exercise our option, which reduces our financial risks associated with long-term land holdings.  Option deposits and pre-acquisition costs (such as environmental testing, surveys, engineering, and entitlement costs) are capitalized if the costs are directly identifiable with the land under option, the costs would be capitalized if we owned the land, and acquisition of the property is probable.  Such costs are reflected in other assets and are reclassified to inventory upon taking title to the land.  We write off deposits and pre-acquisition costs when it becomes probable that we will not go forward with the project or recover the capitalized costs.  Such decisions take into consideration changes in local market conditions, the timing of required land purchases, the availability and best use of necessary incremental capital, and other factors.  We record any such write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs within other expense, net.  See

Note 4

.

If the entity holding the land under option is a variable interest entity (“VIE”), our deposit represents a variable interest in that entity.  If we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, we are required to consolidate the VIE.  Certain of our land option agreements are with entities considered VIEs.  In evaluating whether we are required to consolidate a VIE, we take into consideration that the VIE is generally protected from the first dollar of loss under our land option agreement due to our deposit.  Likewise, the VIE's gains are generally capped based on the purchase price within the land option agreement.  However, we generally have little control or influence over the operations of these VIEs due to our lack of an equity interest in them.  Additionally, creditors of the VIE typically have no recourse against us, and we do not provide financial or other support to these VIEs other than as stipulated in the land option agreements.  Our maximum exposure to loss related to these VIEs is generally limited to our deposits and pre-acquisition costs under the applicable land option agreements.  Historically, cancellations of land option agreements have resulted in write-offs of the related deposits and pre-acquisition costs but have not exposed us to the overall risks or losses of the applicable VIEs.

No

VIEs required consolidation at either

December 31, 2013

or

December 31, 2012

.


PULTEGROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Separately, certain land option agreements represent financing arrangements even though we generally have no obligation to pay these future amounts.  As a result, we recorded

$24.0 million

and

$31.1 million

at

December 31, 2013

and

December 31, 2012

, respectively, to land, not owned, under option agreements with a corresponding increase to accrued and other liabilities.  Such amounts represent the remaining purchase price under the land option agreements, some of which are with VIEs, in the event we exercise the purchase rights under the agreements.

The following provides a summary of our interests in land option agreements ($000’s omitted):

Start-up costs

Costs and expenses associated with opening new communities are expensed when incurred.

Allowance for warranties

Home purchasers are provided with a limited warranty against certain building defects.  We estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time the product revenue is recognized.

Self-insured risks

We maintain, and require the majority of our subcontractors to maintain, general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for certain construction defects.  We also maintain property, errors and omissions, workers compensation, and other business insurance coverage.  These insurance policies protect us against a portion of the risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self-insured per occurrence and aggregate retentions, deductibles, and available policy limits.  However, we retain a significant portion of the overall risk for such claims.  We reserve for these costs on an undiscounted basis at the time product revenue is recognized for each home closing and evaluate the recorded liabilities based on actuarial analyses of our historical claims, which include estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported.  Adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs.  In certain instances, we have the ability to recover a portion of our costs under various insurance policies or from our subcontractors or other third parties.  Estimates of such amounts are recorded when recovery is considered probable.  See

Note 13

.

Residential mortgage loans available-for-sale

Substantially all of the loans originated by us are sold in the secondary mortgage market within a short period of time after origination, generally within 30 days.  In accordance with ASC 825, “Financial Instruments” (“ASC 825”), we use the fair value option to record residential mortgage loans available-for-sale.  Election of the fair value option for these loans allows a better offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions.  We do not designate any derivative instruments as hedges or apply the hedge accounting provisions of ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging.”  See

Note 13

for discussion of the risks retained related to mortgage loan originations.


PULTEGROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Expected gains and losses from the sale of residential mortgage loans and their related servicing rights are included in the measurement of written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through Financial Services revenues at the time of commitment.  Subsequent changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in Financial Services revenues as they occur.  At

December 31, 2013

and


, residential mortgage loans available-for-sale had an aggregate fair value of

$287.9 million

and

$318.9 million

, respectively, and an aggregate outstanding principal balance of

$278.1 million

and

$305.3 million

, respectively.  The net gain (loss) resulting from changes in fair value of these loans totaled

$(1.2) million

and

$(0.2) million

for the years ended

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively.  These changes in fair value were substantially offset by changes in fair value of the corresponding hedging instruments.  Net gains from the sale of mortgages during


,


, and


were

$80.3 million

,

$109.2 million

, and

$59.1 million

, respectively, and have been included in Financial Services revenues.

Mortgage servicing rights

We sell the servicing rights for the loans we originate through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks and costs inherent in servicing loans.  This strategy results in owning the servicing rights for only a short period of time.  We recognize the fair value of our rights to service a mortgage loan as revenue at the time of entering into an interest rate lock commitment with a borrower.  Due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held, we do not amortize the servicing asset.  The servicing sales contracts provide for the reimbursement of payments made by the purchaser if loans prepay within specified periods of time, generally within


to


days after sale.  We establish reserves for this liability at the time the sale is recorded.  Such reserves were immaterial at

December 31, 2013

and


and are included in accrued and other liabilities.

Loans held for investment

We maintain a portfolio of loans that either have been repurchased from investors or were not saleable upon closing.  We have the intent and ability to hold these loans for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff.  These loans are carried at cost and are reviewed for impairment when recoverability becomes doubtful.  Loans held for investment are included in other assets and totaled

$11.0 million

and

$1.3 million

at

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively.

Interest income on mortgage loans

Interest income on mortgage loans is recorded in Financial Services revenues, accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold, and totaled

$7.5 million

,

$6.0 million

, and

$5.0 million

in


,


, and


, respectively.  Loans are placed on non-accrual status once they become greater than


days past due their contractual terms.  Subsequent payments received are applied according to the contractual terms of the loan.  Mortgage discounts are not amortized as interest income due to the short period the loans are held until sale to third party investors.

Mortgage servicing, origination, and commitment fees

Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors.  Servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance, or a contracted set fee in the case of certain sub-servicing arrangements, and are credited to income when related mortgage payments are received or the sub-servicing fees are earned.  Loan origination costs related to residential mortgage loans available-for-sale are recognized as incurred in Financial Services expenses while the associated mortgage origination fees are recognized in Financial Services revenues as earned, generally upon loan closing.

Title services

Revenues associated with our title operations are recognized within Financial Services revenues as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued, both of which generally occur as each home is closed.


PULTEGROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Derivative instruments and hedging activities

We are exposed to market risks from commitments to lend, movements in interest rates, and canceled or modified commitments to lend.  A commitment to lend at a specific interest rate (an interest rate lock commitment) is a derivative financial instrument (interest rate is locked to the borrower).  In order to reduce these risks, we use other derivative financial instruments, principally cash forward placement contracts on mortgage-backed securities and whole loan investor commitments, to economically hedge the interest rate lock commitment.  We enter into these derivative financial instruments based upon our portfolio of interest rate lock commitments and closed loans.  We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

At

December 31, 2013

and


, we had aggregate interest rate lock commitments of

$175.7 million

and

$161.6 million

, respectively, which were originated at interest rates prevailing at the date of commitment.  Since we can terminate a loan commitment if the borrower does not comply with the terms of the contract, and some loan commitments may expire without being drawn upon, these commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.  We evaluate the creditworthiness of these transactions through our normal credit policies.

Forward contracts on mortgage-backed securities are commitments to either purchase or sell a specified financial instrument at a specified future date for a specified price that may be settled in cash, by offsetting the position, or through the delivery of the financial instrument.  Forward contracts on mortgage-backed securities are the predominant derivative financial instruments we use to minimize market risk during the period from the time we extend an interest rate lock to a loan applicant until the time the loan is sold to an investor.  We also use whole loan investor commitments, which are obligations of the investor to buy loans at a specified price within a specified time period.  At

December 31, 2013

and


, we had unexpired forward contracts of

$381.5 million

and

$428.0 million

, respectively, and whole loan investor commitments of

$31.7 million

and

$4.7 million

, respectively.  Changes in the fair value of interest rate lock commitments and other derivative financial instruments are recognized in Financial Services revenues, and the fair values are reflected in other assets or other liabilities, as applicable.

There are no credit-risk-related contingent features within our derivative agreements, and counterparty risk is considered minimal.  Gains and losses on interest rate lock commitments are substantially offset by corresponding gains or losses on forward contracts on mortgage-backed securities and whole loan investor commitments.  We are generally not exposed to variability in cash flows of derivative instruments for more than approximately


days.

The fair values of derivative instruments and their location in the Consolidated Balance Sheets is summarized below ($000’s omitted):

2.    Goodwill

Goodwill was recorded in connection with various acquisitions but was written-off as of December 31, 2011.  We evaluated the recoverability of goodwill by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair value.  Fair value was determined using discounted cash flows supplemented by market-based assessments of fair value, and impairment was measured as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and its recorded carrying value.  The determination of fair value was significantly impacted by estimates related to current market valuations, current and future economic conditions in each of our geographical markets, and our strategic plans within each of our markets.

In the third quarter of 2011, we performed an event-driven assessment of the recoverability of goodwill.  This assessment was necessary primarily due to sustained declines in our market capitalization.  In performing the goodwill impairment analysis, we used management's estimates of the future cash flows for each reporting unit, which were required to consider the decrease in our market capitalization.  The results of this analysis determined that a goodwill impairment charge of

$240.5 million

in the third quarter of 2011 was required.

3.    Corporate office relocation

On May 31, 2013, we announced our plan to relocate our corporate offices to Atlanta, Georgia, from its current location in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, in 2014.  The decision to relocate reflects long-term growth trends for both us and the homebuilding industry and is intended to bring our corporate offices closer to our customers and a larger portion of our investment portfolio.  The relocation of operations will occur in phases over time but is expected to be substantially complete no later than early 2015.  We expect to incur the following approximate costs in connection with the relocation, the substantial majority of which represent future cash expenditures ($000's omitted):

During


, we recorded employee severance, retention, relocation, and related costs of

$15.0 million

and asset impairments of

$0.4 million

.  Severance, retention, relocation, and related costs are recorded within selling, general, and administrative expense, while lease exit and asset impairments are included in other expense, net.  We expect the remaining costs to be recognized in 2014 and 2015.  We will also incur costs at the new location related to the recruitment and onboarding of new employees and certain redundant operating costs.  The amount of such costs is not expected to be material.

4.    Inventory and land held for sale

Major components of inventory at

December 31, 2013

and


were ($000’s omitted):

We capitalize interest cost into inventory during the active development and construction of our communities.  Each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development.  Interest expense is recorded based on the timing of home closings.  In all periods presented, we capitalized all Homebuilding interest costs into inventory because the level of our active inventory exceeded our debt levels.

Information related to interest capitalized into inventory is as follows ($000’s omitted):

(a)

Interest expensed to Home sale cost of revenues for

, and


included

$2.9 million

,

$6.5 million

, and

$5.4 million

, respectively, of capitalized interest write-offs related to land-related charges.

(b)

Homebuilding interest incurred includes interest on senior debt and certain other financing arrangements.

Land-related charges

We recorded the following land-related charges during the three years ended December 31, 2013:

Land impairments

We record land impairment valuation adjustments to our communities within Homebuilding home sale cost of revenues.  Our evaluations for impairments are based on our best estimates of the future cash flows for our communities.  However, if conditions in our local markets worsen in the future or if our strategy related to certain communities changes, we may be required to evaluate our assets for further impairments or write-downs.

Net realizable value adjustments – land held for sale

We record net realizable value adjustments to land held for sale within Homebuilding land sale cost of revenues.  During 2013, the decrease in the gross land held for sale and net realizable value reserve balances resulted primarily from the sale of land parcels, certain of which were previously impaired.  Land held for sale at

six

reportable segments:

We also have a reportable segment for our Financial Services operations, which consist principally of mortgage banking and title operations.  The Financial Services segment operates generally in the same markets as the Homebuilding segments.

Evaluation of segment performance is generally based on income before income taxes.  Each reportable segment generally follows the same accounting policies described in

In

The timing of cash obligations under the joint venture and any related financing agreements varies by agreement.  If additional capital contributions are required and approved, we would need to contribute our pro rata portion of those capital needs in order to not dilute our ownership in the joint ventures.  While future capital contributions may be required, we believe the total amount of such contributions will be limited.  Our maximum financial loss exposure related to joint ventures is unlikely to exceed the combined investment and limited recourse guaranty totals.

Financial Services

Pulte Mortgage provides mortgage financing for the majority of our home closings utilizing its own funds and funds made available pursuant to credit agreements with third party lenders or through intercompany borrowings.  Pulte Mortgage uses these resources to finance its lending activities until the mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market, which generally occurs within


days.

Pulte Mortgage maintains a master repurchase agreement (the “Repurchase Agreement”) with third party lenders that expires in

September 2014

.  Effective January 2014, Pulte Mortgage voluntarily reduced the borrowing capacity under the Repurchase Agreement from

$150.0 million

to

$99.8 million

subject to certain sublimits.  We reduced the borrowing capacity in order to lower associated fees during seasonally low volume periods when the additional capacity is unnecessary.  Borrowings under the Repurchase Agreement are secured by residential mortgage loans available-for-sale.  The Repurchase Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants applicable to Pulte Mortgage, including quantitative thresholds related to net worth, net income, and liquidity.  At

December 31, 2013

, Pulte Mortgage had

$105.7 million

outstanding under the Repurchase Agreement and was in compliance with all of its covenants and requirements.  During 2011 and portions of 2012, Pulte Mortgage funded its operations using internal Company resources after allowing its previous third party credit arrangements to expire.

The following is aggregate borrowing information for our mortgage operations as of each year-end ($000’s omitted):

9.  Stock compensation plans

We maintain a stock award plan for both employees and for non-employee directors.  The plan provides for the grant of a variety of equity awards, including options (generally non-qualified options),  restricted stock, performance shares, and restricted stock units ("RSUs") to key employees (as determined by the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors) for periods not exceeding

ten

years.  Options granted to employees generally vest incrementally over

four

years.  Restricted stock generally cliff vests after

three

years.  Performance shares vest upon attainment of the stated performance targets and minimum service requirements and are converted into shares of common stock upon distribution.  RSUs represent the right to receive an equal number of shares of common stock and are converted into shares of common stock upon distribution.  As of

December 31, 2013

, there were

22.0 million

shares that remained available for grant under the plan.

Non-employee directors are entitled to an annual distribution of stock options, common stock, or restricted stock units.  All options and RSUs granted to non-employee directors vest immediately and are exercisable on the grant date for

ten

years.

The following table summarizes information about the weighted-average remaining contractual lives of stock options outstanding and exercisable at

December 31, 2013

We did not issue any stock options during 2013 or 2012.  The fair value of each option grant issued in 2011 was estimated on the date of grant using primarily the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

We estimate the expected life of stock options using employees’ historical exercise behavior and the contractual terms of the instruments.  Volatility is estimated using historical volatility with consideration for implied volatility.

Total compensation cost related to unvested stock option awards not yet recognized was

$0.2 million

at

December 31, 2013

.  These costs will be expensed over a weighted-average vesting period of approximately

one

year.  The stock option participant agreements provide continued vesting for certain eligible employees who have achieved a predetermined level of service based on their combined age and years of service.  We record the related compensation cost for these awards over the period through the date the employee first achieves the minimum level of service that would no longer require them to provide services to earn the award, which is reflected in the weighted-average vesting period.

The intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option.  The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options that were exercised during

years.

During 2013, 2012, and 2011, we granted performance shares to certain individuals.  The fair value of each performance share was calculated using the stock price on the grant date.  We recognize expense when it becomes probable that the stated performance targets will be achieved.  Unamortized compensation cost related to performance shares considered probable was

$1.3 million

at

December 31, 2013

and will be expensed over a weighted-average period of approximately

one

year.  Additionally, there were

59,708

RSUs outstanding that had vested but had not yet been paid out because the payout date had been deferred by the holder.

Long-term incentive plans

We maintain a long-term incentive plan for certain of our field employees that provides awards based on the achievement of stated performance targets over a

three

-year period.  Awards are earned each year in the form of share units that are paid out in cash at the end of the performance period based upon the number of share units earned times the stock price at the end of the performance period.  Accordingly, the liability associated with the awards is adjusted each reporting period based on movements in the stock price and totaled

$12.6 million

and

$5.9 million

at

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively.

During 2012, we implemented a long-term performance award plan for senior management that provides awards based on the achievement of stated performance targets over a

three

-year period.  Awards are earned based on our cumulative performance over the performance period and are stated in dollars but settled in common shares based on the stock price at the end of the performance period.  If the stock price falls below a floor of

$5.00

per share at the end of the performance period or we do not have a sufficient number of shares available under our stock incentive plans at the time of settlement, then a portion of each award will be paid in cash.  We recognize expense for these awards based on the probability of achievement of the stated performance targets.  The liability for these awards totaled

$14.3 million

Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.  Components of our net deferred tax asset are as follows ($000’s omitted):


PULTEGROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Our effective tax rate is affected by a number of factors, the most significant of which are the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets and changes in our unrecognized tax benefits.  Due to the effects of these factors, our effective tax rates in


,


, and


are not correlated to the amount of our income or loss before income taxes.  The income tax benefit for


resulted from the reversal of substantially all of the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets while the income tax benefits for


and


resulted primarily from the favorable resolution of certain federal and state income tax matters.

From 2007 to 2011, we generated significant deferred tax assets primarily from asset impairments combined with reduced operational profitability.  We evaluate our deferred tax assets each period to determine if a valuation allowance is required based on whether it is "more likely than not" that some portion of the deferred tax assets would not be realized.  The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income during future periods.  We conduct our evaluation by considering all available positive and negative evidence.  This evaluation considers, among other factors, historical operating results, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and the outlooks for the U.S. housing industry and broader economy.  Based on our evaluation through June 30, 2013, we fully reserved our net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of their realization.  One of the primary pieces of negative evidence we considered was the significant losses we incurred in recent years, including being in a three-year cumulative pre-tax loss position, which we exited in 2013.

Consistent with the above process, we evaluated the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and, in the third quarter of 2013, determined that the valuation allowance against substantially all of our federal deferred tax assets and a significant portion of our state deferred tax assets was no longer required.  Accordingly, we reversed

$2.1 billion

of valuation allowance in the third quarter.  When a change in valuation allowance is recognized in an interim period, a portion of the valuation allowance to be reversed must be allocated to the remaining interim periods. Accordingly, an additional

$73.7 million

of the remaining valuation allowance reversed in the fourth quarter of 2013, which was offset by a tax provision based on fourth quarter earnings.  At December 31, 2013, the valuation allowance relates primarily to state net operating loss carryforwards that have not met the "more likely than not" realization threshold.

We conducted our evaluation by considering all available positive and negative evidence.  The principal positive evidence that led to the reversal of the valuation allowance included:  (1) our emergence from a three-year cumulative loss in 2013; (2) the significant positive income we generated during 2012 and 2013, including seven consecutive quarters of pretax income as of December 31, 2013; (3) continued improvements in 2013 over recent years in other key operating metrics, including revenues, gross margin, and overhead leverage; (4) our forecasted future profitability; (5) improvement in our financial position; and (6) significant evidence that conditions in the U.S. housing industry are more favorable than in recent years and our belief that conditions will continue to be favorable over the long-term.  Even if industry conditions weaken from current levels, we believe we will be able to adjust our operations to sustain long-term profitability.

The accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results.  Differences between estimated and actual results could result in changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets that could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.  Changes in existing tax laws could also affect actual tax results and the realization of deferred tax assets over time.

Our gross federal NOL carryforward is approximately

$2.1 billion

, a portion of which is subject to the provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 382.  We also have significant state NOLs in various tax jurisdictions.  These NOLs may generally be carried forward from 5 to 20 years, depending on the tax jurisdiction, with NOLs expiring between


and


.

As a result of our merger with Centex in 2009, our ability to use certain of Centex’s pre-ownership change NOL carryforwards and built-in losses or deductions is limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.  Our Section 382 limitation is approximately

$67.4 million

per year for NOLs, losses realized on built-in loss assets that are sold within


months of the ownership change, and certain deductions.  We do not believe that the Section 382 limitation will prevent the Company from using Centex’s pre-ownership change federal NOL carryforwards and built-in losses or deductions.

11.  Fair value disclosures

ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” provides a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  The fair value hierarchy can be summarized as follows:

Our assets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value are summarized below ($000’s omitted):

Fair values for agency residential mortgage loans available-for-sale are determined based on quoted market prices for comparable instruments.  Fair values for non-agency residential mortgage loans available-for-sale are determined based on purchase commitments from whole loan investors and other relevant market information available to management.  Fair values for interest rate lock commitments, including the value of servicing rights, are based on market prices for similar instruments.  Forward contracts on mortgage-backed securities are valued based on market prices for similar instruments.  Fair values for whole loan investor commitments are based on market prices for similar instruments from the specific whole loan investor.

Certain assets are required to be recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  The non-recurring fair values included in the table above represent only those assets whose carrying values were adjusted to fair value as of the respective balance sheet dates. See

Note 1

for a more detailed discussion of the valuation methods used for inventory.

The carrying amounts of cash and equivalents and Financial Services debt approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature.  The fair values of senior notes are based on quoted market prices, when available.  If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of similar issues.

Loan origination liabilities

Our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements, including representations as to underwriting standards, the existence of primary mortgage insurance, and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan.  If a loan is determined to be faulty, we either repurchase the loans from the investors or reimburse the investors' losses (a “make-whole” payment).

In recent years, we experienced a significant increase in losses related to repurchase requests as a result of the high level of loan defaults and related losses in the mortgage industry and increasing aggressiveness by investors in presenting such claims to us.  To date, the significant majority of these losses relates to loans originated in 2006 and 2007, during which period inherently riskier loan products became more common in the mortgage origination market.  In 2006 and 2007, we originated

$39.5 billion

of loans, excluding loans originated by Centex's former subprime loan business sold by Centex in 2006.  Because we generally do not retain the servicing rights to the loans we originate, information regarding the current and historical performance, credit quality, and outstanding balances of such loans is limited.  Estimating these loan origination liabilities is further complicated by uncertainties surrounding numerous external factors, such as various macroeconomic factors (including unemployment rates and changes in home prices), actions taken by third parties, including the parties servicing the loans, and the U.S. federal government in its dual capacity as regulator of the U.S. mortgage industry and conservator of the government-sponsored enterprises commonly known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which own or guarantee the majority of mortgage loans in the U.S.

Most requests received to date relate to make-whole payments on loans that have been foreclosed. Requests undergo extensive analysis to confirm the exposure, attempt to cure the identified defect, and, when necessary, determine our liability.  We establish liabilities for such anticipated losses based upon, among other things, the level of current unresolved repurchase requests, the volume of estimated probable future repurchase requests, our ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchase requests, and the severity of the estimated loss upon repurchase.  Determining these estimates and the resulting liability requires a significant level of management judgment.  We are generally able to cure or refute over

60%

of the requests received from investors such that we do not believe repurchases or make-whole payments will ultimately be required.  For those requests that we believe will result in repurchases or make-whole payments, actual loss severities are expected to approximate

50%

of the outstanding principal balance.

During


and


, we recorded provisions for losses as a change in estimate primarily to reflect projected claim volumes in excess of previous estimates.  Such provisions for losses are reflected in Financial Services expenses.  Given the ongoing volatility in the mortgage industry, our lack of visibility into the current status of the review process of loans by investors, the claim volumes we continue to experience, changes in values of underlying collateral over time, and other uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims, actual costs could differ from our current estimates.  Changes in these liabilities were as follows ($000's omitted):

We entered into an agreement in conjunction with the wind down of Centex's mortgage operations, which ceased loan origination activities in December 2009, that provides a guaranty for one major investor of loans originated by Centex.  This guaranty provides that we will honor the potential repurchase obligations of Centex's mortgage operations related to breaches of representations and warranties in the origination of a certain pool of loans.  Other than with respect to this pool of loans, our contractual repurchase obligations are limited to our mortgage subsidiaries, which are included in non-guarantor subsidiaries (see

Note 14

for a discussion of non-guarantor subsidiaries).


PULTEGROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

The mortgage subsidiary of Centex also sold loans to a bank for inclusion in residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBSs”) issued by the bank.  In connection with these sales, Centex's mortgage subsidiary entered into agreements pursuant to which it may be required to indemnify the bank for losses incurred by investors in the RMBSs arising out of material errors or omissions in certain information provided by the mortgage subsidiary relating to the loans and loan origination process. In 2011, the bank notified us that it has been named defendant in

two

lawsuits alleging various violations of federal and state securities laws asserting that untrue statements of material fact were included in the registration statements used to market the sale of

two

RMBS transactions which included

$162 million

of loans originated by Centex's mortgage subsidiary.  The plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory and/or rescissory damages on behalf of persons who purchased the securities.  Neither Centex's mortgage subsidiary nor the Company is named as a defendant in these actions.  We cannot yet quantify Centex's mortgage subsidiary's potential liability as a result of these indemnification obligations.  We do not believe, however, that these matters will have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial position, or cash flows of the Company.  We are aware of

six

other RMBS transactions with similar indemnity provisions that include an aggregate

$116 million

of loans originated by Centex's mortgage subsidiary, and we are not aware of any current or threatened legal proceedings regarding those transactions.

Community development and other special district obligations

A community development district or similar development authority (“CDD”) is a unit of local government created under various state statutes that utilizes the proceeds from the sale of bonds to finance the construction or acquisition of infrastructure assets of a development. A portion of the liability associated with the bonds, including principal and interest, is assigned to each parcel of land within the development.  This debt is typically paid by subsequent special assessments levied by the CDD on the landowners.  Generally, we are only responsible for paying the special assessments for the period during which we are the landowner of the applicable parcels.  However, in certain limited instances we record a liability for future assessments if the assessments are fixed or determinable for a fixed or determinable period.  At

December 31, 2013

and


, we had recorded

$26.1 million

and

$33.1 million

, respectively, in accrued liabilities for outstanding CDD obligations.

Letters of credit and surety bonds

In the normal course of business, we post letters of credit and surety bonds pursuant to certain performance-related obligations, as security for certain land option agreements, and under various insurance programs.  The majority of these letters of credit and surety bonds are in support of our land development and construction obligations to various municipalities, other government agencies, and utility companies related to the construction of roads, sewers, and other infrastructure.  We had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds totaling

$183.1 million

and

$958.3 million

, respectively, at

December 31, 2013

, and

$179.2 million

and

$1.0 billion

, respectively, at

December 31, 2012

.  In the event any such letter of credit or surety bonds are called, we would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit or surety bond.  We do not believe that a material amount, if any, of the letters of credit or surety bonds will be called.  Our surety bonds generally do not have stated expiration dates; rather we are released from the surety bonds as the underlying contractual performance is completed.  Because significant construction and development work has been performed related to the applicable projects but has not yet received final acceptance by the respective counterparties, the aggregate amount of surety bonds outstanding is in excess of the projected cost of the remaining work to be performed.

Litigation and regulatory matters

We are involved in various litigation and legal claims in the normal course of our business operations, including actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants.  We are also subject to a variety of local, state, and federal laws and regulations related to land development activities, house construction standards, sales practices, mortgage lending operations, employment practices, and protection of the environment.  As a result, we are subject to periodic examination or inquiry by various governmental agencies that administer these laws and regulations.


PULTEGROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

We establish liabilities for legal claims and regulatory matters when such matters are both probable of occurring and any potential loss is reasonably estimable.  We accrue for such matters based on the facts and circumstances specific to each matter and revise these estimates as the matters evolve.  In such cases, there may exist an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts currently accrued.  In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of these legal and regulatory matters, we generally cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the pending matters, the related timing, or the eventual loss.   While the outcome of such contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the resolution of such matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.  However, to the extent the liability arising from the ultimate resolution of any matter exceeds the estimates reflected in the recorded reserves relating to such matter, we could incur additional charges that could be significant.

During 2013, we settled a number of claims related to a previously completed luxury community in a market we have since exited.  The claims related to a contractual dispute with certain homeowners.  Substantially all of these claims have been resolved.  As the result of these settlements, we recorded charges of

$41.2 million

during


.  We believe that the final resolution of all matters related to these claims will not vary materially from our current estimates.

Allowance for warranties

Home purchasers are provided with a limited warranty against certain building defects, including a one-year comprehensive limited warranty and coverage for certain other aspects of the home’s construction and operating systems for periods of up to


years.  We estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record liabilities in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized.  Factors that affect our warranty liabilities include the number of homes sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and the cost per claim.  We periodically assess the adequacy of the warranty liabilities for each geographic market in which we operate and adjust the amounts as necessary.  Actual warranty costs in the future could differ from the current estimates.  Changes to warranty liabilities were as follows ($000’s omitted):

Self-insured risks

We maintain, and require our subcontractors to maintain, general liability insurance coverage.  We also maintain builders' risk, property, errors and omissions, workers compensation, and other business insurance coverage.  These insurance policies protect us against a portion of the risk of loss from claims.  However, we retain a significant portion of the overall risk for such claims either through policies issued by our captive insurance subsidiaries or through our own self-insured per occurrence and aggregate retentions, deductibles, and claims in excess of available insurance policy limits.

Our general liability insurance includes coverage for certain construction defects.  While construction defect claims can relate to a variety of circumstances, the majority of our claims relate to alleged problems with siding, plumbing, foundations and other concrete work, windows, roofing, and heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems.  The availability of general liability insurance for the homebuilding industry and its subcontractors has become increasingly limited, and the insurance policies available require companies to maintain significant per occurrence and aggregate retention levels.  In certain instances, we may offer our subcontractors the opportunity to purchase insurance through one of our captive insurance subsidiaries or to participate in a project-specific insurance program provided by the Company.  Policies issued by the captive insurance subsidiaries represent self-insurance of these risks by the Company.  This self-insured exposure is limited by reinsurance policies that we purchase.  General liability coverage for the homebuilding industry is complex, and our coverage varies from policy year to policy year.  Our insurance coverage requires a per occurrence deductible up to an overall aggregate retention level.  Beginning with the first dollar, amounts paid on insured claims satisfy our per occurrence and aggregate retention obligations.  Any amounts incurred in excess of the occurrence or aggregate retention levels are covered by insurance up to our purchased coverage levels.  Our insurance policies, including the captive insurance subsidiaries' reinsurance policies, are maintained with highly-rated underwriters for whom we believe counterparty default risk is not significant.


PULTEGROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

At any point in time, we are managing over

1,000

individual claims related to general liability, property, errors and omission, workers compensation, and other business insurance coverage.  We reserve for costs associated with such claims (including expected claims management expenses) on an undiscounted basis at the time revenue is recognized for each home closing and evaluate the recorded liabilities based on actuarial analyses of our historical claims.  The actuarial analyses calculate estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses, including estimates for incurred but not reported losses ("IBNR").  IBNR represents losses related to claims incurred but not yet reported plus development on reported claims.  These estimates comprise a significant portion of our liability and are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors, including changes in claims reporting and resolution patterns, third party recoveries, insurance industry practices, the regulatory environment, and legal precedent.  State regulations vary, but construction defect claims are reported and resolved over an extended period often exceeding ten years.  In certain instances, we have the ability to recover a portion of our costs under various insurance policies or from subcontractors or other third parties.  Estimates of such amounts are recorded when recovery is considered probable.

Our recorded reserves for all such claims totaled

$668.1 million

and

$721.3 million

at

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively, the vast majority of which relates to general liability claims.  The recorded reserves include loss estimates related to both (i) existing claims and related claim expenses and (ii) IBNR and related claim expenses.  Liabilities related to IBNR and related claim expenses represented approximately

78%

and

74%

of the total general liability reserves at

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively.  The actuarial analyses that determine the IBNR portion of reserves consider a variety of factors, including the frequency and severity of losses, which are based on our historical claims experience supplemented by industry data.  The actuarial analyses of the reserves also consider historical third party recovery rates and claims management expenses.

Adjustments to reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs.  Because the majority of our reserves relate to IBNR, adjustments to reserve amounts for individual existing claims generally do not impact the recorded reserves materially.  However, changes in the frequency and timing of reported claims and estimates of specific claim values can impact the underlying inputs and trends utilized in the actuarial analyses, which could have a material impact on the recorded reserves.  Because of the inherent uncertainty in estimating future losses related to these claims, actual costs could differ significantly from estimated costs.  Costs associated with our insurance programs are classified within selling, general, and administrative expenses.  Changes in these liabilities were as follows ($000's omitted):

The reserves provided reflected in the above table are classified within selling, general, and administrative expenses.

14.  Supplemental Guarantor information

All of our senior notes are guaranteed jointly and severally on a senior basis by each of the Company's wholly-owned Homebuilding subsidiaries and certain other wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Guarantors”).

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

(a)

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management’s judgments and estimates concerning events and transactions that are accounted for or disclosed.

Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control and effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Additionally, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time.

In order to ensure that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective, management regularly assesses such controls and did so most recently for its financial reporting as of

December 31, 2013

.  Management’s assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 Framework). Based on this assessment, management asserts that the Company has maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2013

.

Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, has issued its report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2013

(b)

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of PulteGroup, Inc.

We have audited PulteGroup, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2013

, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 Framework) (the COSO criteria). PulteGroup, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, PulteGroup, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2013

, based on the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of PulteGroup, Inc. as of

December 31, 2013

and


, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
