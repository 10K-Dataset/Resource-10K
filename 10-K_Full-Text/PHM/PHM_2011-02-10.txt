PART I

ITEM I. BUSINESS

PulteGroup, Inc.

On
March 18, 2010, we changed our name from Pulte Homes, Inc. to PulteGroup, Inc. (“PulteGroup” or the “Company”). PulteGroup is a publicly-held holding company traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol
“PHM”. We are one of the largest homebuilders in the United States. PulteGroup is a Michigan corporation organized in 1956, though our founder began our homebuilding operations in 1950. While our subsidiaries engage primarily in the
homebuilding business, we also have mortgage banking operations, conducted principally through Pulte Mortgage LLC (“Pulte Mortgage”), and title operations.

On August 18, 2009, we completed the acquisition of Centex Corporation (“Centex”) through the merger of PulteGroup’s merger subsidiary with and into Centex pursuant to the Agreement
and Plan of Merger dated as of April 7, 2009 among PulteGroup, Pi Nevada Building Company, and Centex. As a result of the merger, Centex became a wholly-owned subsidiary of PulteGroup. Accordingly, the results of Centex are included in our
consolidated financial statements from the date of the merger.

Since early 2006, the U.S. housing market has been unfavorably
impacted by weak consumer confidence, tightened mortgage standards, and large supplies of resale and new home inventories and related pricing pressures, among other factors. When combined with significant foreclosure activity, a more challenging
appraisal environment, higher than normal unemployment levels, and uncertainty in the United States economy in recent periods, these conditions have contributed to sharply weakened demand for new homes, slower sales, and heightened pricing pressures
to attract homebuyers. As a result, we have experienced a pre-tax loss in each quarter since the fourth quarter of 2006. Such losses resulted from a combination of reduced operational profitability and significant asset impairments.

Homebuilding, our core business, is engaged in the acquisition and development of land primarily for residential purposes within the
continental United States and the construction of housing on such land targeted for first-time, first and second move-up, and active adult home buyers. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we realigned the organizational structure for certain of our
Areas. As a result, our reportable Homebuilding segments are as follows:

We also have one reportable segment for our financial services operations, which consists principally of mortgage banking and title operations. Our Financial Services segment operates generally in the
same geographic markets as our Homebuilding segments.

Financial information for each of our reportable business segments is
included in Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Homebuilding Operations

Through our brands, which include Pulte Homes, Del Webb, Centex, and DiVosta, we offer a wide variety of
home designs including single-family detached, townhouses, condominiums, and duplexes at different prices and with varying levels of options and amenities to all of our major customer segments: first-time, first and second move-up, and active adult.
Over our 61-year history, we have delivered over 575,000 homes.

As of December 31, 2010, our Homebuilding operations
offered homes for sale in nearly 800 communities. Sales prices of unit settlements during 2010 ranged from less than $100,000 to greater than $1.0 million, with 89% falling within the range of $100,000 to $400,000. The average unit selling price in
2010 was $259,000, compared with $258,000 in 2009, $284,000 in 2008, $322,000 in 2007, and $337,000 in 2006. The significant decrease in the average selling price of our homes since 2006 resulted from a combination of pricing pressures due to
challenging industry conditions and a shift in product mix toward more first-time buyers.

Sales of single-family detached
homes, as a percentage of total unit sales, were 79% in 2010, compared with 77% in 2009, 75% in 2008, and 74% in both 2007 and 2006. The increase in the percentage of single-family detached homes can be attributed to a weakened demand for
townhouses, condominiums, and other attached housing, as prices for detached new homes have become more affordable for first-time and active adult homebuyers. Our Homebuilding operations are geographically diverse and, as a result, help to insulate
us from demand changes in individual markets. Since 2006, however, such diversification has not insulated us from demand changes due to the nationwide downturn in the homebuilding industry that has had a significant adverse impact on operations in
each of our markets. As of December 31, 2010, our Homebuilding business operated in 67 markets spanning 29 states and the District of Columbia.

Ending backlog, which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed, was $1.1 billion (3,984 units) at December 31, 2010 and $1.6 billion (5,931 units) at December 31, 2009. For each
order in backlog, we have received a signed customer contract and the required customer deposit, which is refundable in certain instances. Of the orders in backlog at December 31, 2010, substantially all are scheduled to be closed during 2011,
though all orders are subject to potential cancellation by or final negotiations with the customer. In the event of cancellation, the majority of our sales contracts stipulate that we have the right to retain the customer’s deposit, though we
may choose to refund the deposit in certain instances.

Land acquisition and development

We acquire land primarily for the construction of our homes for sale to homebuyers, though we periodically sell select parcels of land to
third parties for commercial or other development. Additionally, we may determine that certain land assets no longer fit into our strategic operating plans. We select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing a
feasibility study, which includes, among other things, soil tests, independent environmental studies and other engineering work, an evaluation of the necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements, and extensive market research that enables us
to match the location and product offering with our targeted consumer group. We consider factors such as proximity to developed areas, population and job growth patterns and, if applicable, estimated development costs. We frequently manage a portion
of the risk of controlling our land positions through the use of option contracts. We typically acquire land with the intent to complete sales of housing units within 24 to 36 months from the date of opening a community, except in the case of
certain Del Webb active adult developments and other large projects for which the completion of community build-out requires a longer time period. As a result of the downturn in the homebuilding industry that began in 2006, however, our supply of
controlled land is in excess of our short-term needs in many of our markets.

Land is generally purchased after it is properly
zoned and developed or is ready for development. In the normal course of business, we dispose of owned land not required by our homebuilding operations through sales to appropriate end users. Where we develop land, we engage directly in many phases
of the development process, including land and



Homebuilding Operations (continued)

Land acquisition and development (continued)

site planning, and obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals, as well as constructing roads, sewers, water and drainage facilities, and other amenities. We use our staff and the
services of independent engineers and consultants for land development activities. Land development work is performed primarily by independent contractors and local government authorities who construct sewer and water systems in some areas. At
December 31, 2010, we controlled 147,194 lots, of which 131,964 were owned and 15,230 were under option agreements.

Sales and
marketing

We are dedicated to improving the quality and value of our homes through innovative architectural and community
designs and state-of-the-art customer marketing techniques. Analyzing various qualitative and quantitative data obtained through extensive market research, we segment our potential customers into well-defined buyer groups. Segmentation analysis
provides a method for understanding the business opportunities and risks across the full spectrum of consumer groups in each market. Once the demands of potential buyers are understood, we link our home design and community development efforts to
the specific lifestyle of each targeted consumer group.

To meet the demands of our various customers, we have established a
solid design expertise for a wide array of product lines. We believe that we are an innovator in home design, and we view design capacity as an integral aspect of our marketing strategy. Our in-house architectural services teams and management,
supplemented by outside consultants, are successful in creating distinctive design features, both in exterior facades and interior options and features. We typically offer a variety of potential options and upgrades, such as different flooring,
countertop, and appliance choices and design our base house and option packages to meet the needs of our customers as defined through rigorous market research.

Typically, our sales teams, together with outside sales brokers, are responsible for guiding the customer through the sales process. We are committed to industry-leading customer service through a variety
of quality initiatives, including our customer care program, which ensures that homeowners are comfortable at every stage of the building process. Using a seven-step, interactive process, homeowners are kept informed during their homebuilding and
home owning experience. The steps include (1) a pre-construction meeting with the construction field manager; (2) pre-dry wall frame walk; (3) quality assurance inspection; (4) first homeowner orientation; (5) 30-day
follow-up after the close of the home; (6) three-month follow-up after the close of the home; and (7) an 11-month quality list after the close of the home. Fully furnished and landscaped model homes are used to showcase our homes and their
distinctive design features. Financing under United States government-insured and guaranteed programs is often used and is facilitated through our financial services operations.

Through our Del Webb brand, we are better able to address the needs of active adults, which is among the fastest growing homebuying
segments. We offer both destination communities and “in place” communities, for those buyers who prefer to remain in their current geographic area. These highly amenitized communities offer a variety of features, including golf courses,
recreational centers, and educational classes, to the over age fifty-five buyer to maintain an active lifestyle.

Through our
portfolio of brands, each serving unique customer segments, we are able to provide a distinct experience to potential customers. We introduce our homes to prospective buyers through a variety of media advertising, illustrated brochures, Internet
listings and link placements, mobile applications, and other advertising displays. In addition, our websites,

www.pulte.com, www.delwebb.com, www.centex.com,

and

www.divosta.com

provide tools to help users find a home that meets their
needs, investigate financing alternatives, communicate moving plans, maintain a home, learn more about us, and communicate directly with us. Approximately 6.5 million potential customers visited our websites during 2010.

Construction

The
construction process for our homes begins with the in-house design of the homes we sell. The building phase is conducted under the supervision of our on-site construction field managers. Substantially all of our construction work is performed by
independent subcontractors under contracts that, in many instances, cover both labor and materials on a fixed-price basis. We believe that our subcontractors and material suppliers are an extension of our



Homebuilding Operations (continued)

Construction (continued)

production system and jointly focus on lean construction techniques to bring the highest value possible to our customers while maintaining strong trade relations. Using a selective process, we
have teamed up with what we believe are premier subcontractors and suppliers to improve all aspects of the house construction process.

We maintain efficient construction operations by using standard materials and components from a variety of sources and utilizing standard construction practices. We continue to shift toward component
off-site manufacturing methods for certain portions of the construction process to provide high efficiency, high quality, and lower cost products to our customers. To minimize the effects of changes in construction costs, the contracting and
purchasing of building supplies and materials generally is negotiated at or near the time when related sales contracts are signed. In addition, we leverage our size by actively negotiating certain materials on a national or regional basis to
minimize production component cost. We are also working to establish a more integrated system that can effectively link suppliers, contractors, and the production schedule through various strategic business partnerships and e-business initiatives.

We cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials will be available at reasonable prices in the future.
While the availability of materials and labor is not a significant concern under current market conditions, we have, on occasion, experienced shortages of skilled labor in certain trades and of building materials in some markets in previous years.

Competition, regulation, and other factors

Our dedication to customer satisfaction is evidenced by our consumer and value-based brand approach to product development and is something that we believe distinguishes us in the homebuilding industry
and contributes to our long-term competitive advantage. The housing industry in the United States, however, is fragmented and highly competitive. In each of our local markets, there are numerous homebuilders with which we compete. We also compete
with sales of existing house inventory. Any provider of housing units, for sale or to rent, including apartment operators, may be considered a competitor. Conversion of apartments to condominiums further provides certain segments of the population
an alternative to traditional housing, as does manufactured housing. We compete primarily on the basis of location, price, reputation, design, community amenities, and the quality of our homes. The housing industry is affected by a number of
economic and other factors including: (1) significant national and world events, which impact consumer confidence; (2) changes in the costs of building materials and labor; (3) changes in interest rates; (4) changes in other
costs associated with home ownership, such as property taxes and energy costs; (5) the supply of new and existing housing, including foreclosures; (6) various demographic factors; (7) changes in federal income tax laws;
(8) changes in government mortgage financing programs; and (9) availability of sufficient mortgage capacity. In addition to these factors, our business and operations could be affected by shifts in the overall demand for new homes.

Our homebuilding operating cycle historically reflected increased revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth
quarter based on the timing of home settlements. However, the challenging market conditions experienced since early 2006 have lessened the seasonal variations of our results. Given the current significant uncertainty in the homebuilding industry, we
can make no assurances as to when and whether our historical seasonality will recur.

Our operations are subject to building,
environmental, and other regulations of various federal, state, and local governing authorities. For our homes to qualify for Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”) or Veterans Administration (“VA”) mortgages, we must satisfy
valuation standards and site, material, and construction requirements of those agencies. Our compliance with federal, state, and local laws relating to protection of the environment has had, to date, no material effect upon our capital expenditures,
earnings, or competitive position. More stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers, thereby increasing the cost of compliance.

On December 1, 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) promulgated new regulations regarding effluent limitation guidelines (“ELG”) for discharges from construction and
development sites. The new rule requires all construction sites subject to National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System construction storm water permits issued by the EPA or an authorized state to implement certain sediment and erosion controls
and pollution prevention measures. These rules also require sampling of storm water discharges and compliance with a numeric effluent



Homebuilding Operations (continued)

Competition, regulation, and other factors (continued)

limitation of 280 nephelometric turbidity units (“NTUs”) beginning August 1, 2011 for sites disturbing 20 or more acres at once and beginning February 2, 2014 for sites
disturbing 10 or more acres at once. Effective January 4, 2011, the effluent limitation standard of 280 NTUs has been stayed by the EPA until it can complete a new rulemaking to correct the numeric limitation. The EPA currently plans to prepare
a revision to the current numeric limit of 280 NTUs in early 2011 and to take final action in May 2011. The numeric limit is the only portion of the new rule that has been stayed by the EPA.

In addition to the new ELG rules, the EPA also announced that it is committed to and has begun a rulemaking to address post-construction
storm water discharges from newly developed and redeveloped sites. This rulemaking is expected to be completed by November 2012. There can be no assurance whether the EPA will adopt final rules regarding post-construction storm water discharges, or,
if it does, the form the final rules will take.

We are currently assessing the impact that the new ELG rules and potential
post-construction rules will have on its business and results of operations.

Financial Services Operations

We conduct our financial services business, which includes mortgage and title operations, through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries.
Pulte Mortgage arranges financing through the origination of mortgage loans primarily for the benefit of our homebuyers. We also engage in the sale of such loans and the related servicing rights. We are a lender approved by the FHA and VA and are a
seller/servicer approved by Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”), Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”), and other investors. In our conventional
mortgage lending activities, we follow underwriting guidelines established by FNMA, FHLMC, and private investors. We believe that our customers’ use of our in-house mortgage and title operations provides us with a competitive advantage by
enabling more control over the quality of the overall home buying process for our customers while also helping us align the timing of the house construction process with our customers’ financing needs.

We utilize a centralized fulfillment center to perform our mortgage underwriting, processing and closing functions and also use
centralized loan consultants. We believe centralizing both the fulfillment and origination of our loans improves the speed, efficiency, consistency, and quality of our mortgage operations, improving our profitability and allowing us to focus on
providing attractive mortgage financing opportunities for our customers. The majority of our customers now send us their data online to start the mortgage process. Once the completed online questionnaire is received, an interview is scheduled and
the combination of the interview with the data sent online represents our mortgage application.

In originating mortgage
loans, we initially use our own funds and borrowings made available to us through various credit arrangements. We subsequently sell such mortgage loans to outside investors. Substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary
market within a short period of time after origination.

During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we originated mortgage loans for 63%,
70%, and 72%, respectively, of the homes we sold. Such originations represented substantially all of our total originations in each of those years as the primary purpose for our mortgage operations is to support our homebuilding business. Our
capture rate, which we define as loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding business excluding cash settlements, was 78% in 2010, while the capture rate was 85% in 2009 and 92%
in 2008.

We sell our servicing rights monthly on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the
risks inherent in servicing loans. This strategy results in owning the servicing rights for only a short period of time. The servicing sales contracts provide for the reimbursement of payments made when loans prepay within specified periods of time,
usually 90 to 120 days after sale.

The mortgage industry in the United States is highly competitive. We compete with other
mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide attractive mortgage financing to our homebuyers. The Internet is also an important resource for homebuyers in obtaining financing as a number of competitors provide online approval for their
customers.



Financial Services Operations (continued)

In originating and servicing mortgage loans, we are subject to rules and regulations of
the FHA, VA, GNMA, FNMA, and FHLMC. In addition to being affected by changes in these programs, our mortgage banking business is also affected by many of the same factors that impact our homebuilding business.

Our mortgage operations are also subject to potential losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors that may
result from borrower fraud, borrower early payment defaults, or loans that have not been underwritten in accordance with the investor guidelines. In the normal course of business, our mortgage operations also provide limited indemnities for certain
loans sold to investors. Historically, losses related to these indemnities were not significant. Beginning in 2009, we experienced a significant increase in anticipated losses as a result of the high level of loan defaults and related losses in the
mortgage industry and increasing aggressiveness by investors in presenting such claims to us. The vast majority of these losses relate to loans originated in 2006 and 2007 when industry lending standards were less stringent and borrower fraud is
believed to have peaked.

Our subsidiary title insurance companies serve as title insurance agents in select markets by
providing title insurance policies and examination and closing services to buyers of homes we sell. We have only limited risk associated with our title operations due to the low incidence of claims related to underwriting risk associated with
issued title insurance policies and fiduciary risk resulting from closing services.

Financial Information About Geographic Areas

Substantially all of our operations are located within the United States. However, we have some non-operating foreign
subsidiaries and affiliates, which are insignificant to our consolidated financial results.

Other Non-Operating Expenses

Other non-operating expenses consist of income and expenses related to corporate services provided to our subsidiaries. These expenses are
incurred for financing, developing, and implementing strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies, and providing the necessary administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity listed on
the New York Stock Exchange. Accordingly, these results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve.

Organization/Employees

All subsidiaries and operating units operate independently with respect to daily operations. Homebuilding real estate purchases and other
significant homebuilding, mortgage banking, financing activities, and similar operating decisions must be approved by the business unit’s management and/or corporate senior management.

At December 31, 2010, we employed 4,363 people, of which 630 people were employed in our Financial Services operations. Except for a
small group of employees in our St. Louis homebuilding division, our employees are not represented by any union. Contracted work, however, may be performed by union contractors. Our local and corporate management personnel are paid incentive
compensation based on a combination of individual performance and the performance of the applicable business unit or the Company. Each business unit is given a level of autonomy regarding employment of personnel, although our senior corporate
management acts in an advisory capacity in the employment of subsidiary officers. We consider our employee and contractor relations to be satisfactory.



ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on Form 10-K should be read together with the risk factors set
forth below. They describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are, or may become, subject. These risks and uncertainties, together with other factors described elsewhere in this report, have the potential to affect our business, financial
condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies, or prospects in a material and adverse manner.

Downward changes in general
economic, real estate construction, or other business conditions could adversely affect our business or our financial results.

The residential homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors, such as the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of financing,
and interest rate levels. Adverse changes in any of these conditions generally, or in the markets where we operate, could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts, which could
adversely affect the number of home deliveries we make or reduce the prices we can charge for homes, either of which could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings and would adversely affect our financial condition.

The homebuilding industry is currently experiencing an economic down cycle, which has had an adverse effect on our business and results of
operations.

Prior to 2006, land and home prices rose significantly in many of our markets. However, since early 2006,
the homebuilding industry has been impacted by weak consumer confidence, tightened mortgage standards, a significant increase in the number of foreclosed homes, and large supplies of resale and new home inventories which have contributed to an
industry-wide softening of demand for new homes. As a result of these factors, we have experienced significant decreases in our revenues and profitability. We have also incurred substantial impairments of our land and certain other assets. We cannot
predict the duration or the severity of the current market conditions, nor provide any assurances that the adjustments we have made in our operating strategy to address these conditions will be successful.

If the market value of our land and homes drops significantly, our profits could decrease.

The market value of land, building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions and
the measures we employ to manage inventory risk may not be adequate to insulate our operations from a severe drop in inventory values. We acquire land for expansion into new markets and for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our
current markets. If housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory, we may not be able to make profits similar to what we have made in the past, we may experience less than anticipated profits, and/or we may not be
able to recover our costs when we sell and build homes. When market conditions are such that land values are not appreciating, option arrangements previously entered into may become less desirable, at which time we may elect to forego deposits and
pre-acquisition costs and terminate the agreement. In the face of adverse market conditions, we may have substantial inventory carrying costs, we may have to write down our inventory to its fair value, and/or we may have to sell land or homes at a
loss.

As a result of the changing market conditions in the homebuilding industry that have occurred since early 2006, we
incurred significant land-related charges in each of the respective periods resulting from the write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to land transactions we no longer plan to pursue, net realizable valuation adjustments related to
land positions sold or held for sale, impairments on land assets related to communities under development or to be developed in the future, and impairments of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. It is possible that the estimated cash
flows from these projects may change and could result in a future need to record additional valuation adjustments. Additionally, if conditions in the homebuilding industry worsen in the future or if our strategy related to certain communities
changes, we may be required to evaluate our assets, including additional projects, for additional impairments or write-downs, which could result in additional charges that might be significant.

Our success depends on our ability to acquire land suitable for residential homebuilding at reasonable prices, in accordance with our land
investment criteria.

The homebuilding industry is highly competitive for suitable land. The availability of finished
and partially finished developed lots and undeveloped land for purchase that meet our internal criteria depends on a number of factors outside our control, including land availability in general, competition with other homebuilders and land buyers



Our success depends on our ability to acquire land suitable for residential homebuilding at
reasonable prices, in accordance with our land investment criteria. (continued)

for desirable property, inflation in land prices, zoning, allowable housing density, and other regulatory requirements. Should suitable lots or land become less available, the number of homes we
may be able to build and sell could be reduced, and the cost of land could be increased, perhaps substantially, which could adversely impact our results of operations.

Our long-term ability to build homes depends on our acquiring land suitable for residential building at reasonable prices in locations where we want to build. In the past, we experienced significant
competition for suitable land as a result of land constraints in many of our markets. As competition for suitable land increases, and as available land is developed, the cost of acquiring suitable remaining land could rise, and the availability of
suitable land at acceptable prices may decline. Any land shortages or any decrease in the supply of suitable land at reasonable prices could limit our ability to develop new communities or result in increased land costs. We may not be able to pass
through to our customers any increased land costs, which could adversely impact our revenues, earnings, and margins.

Future increases
in interest rates, reductions in mortgage availability, or increases in the effective costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business and financial results.

Most of our customers finance their home purchases through our mortgage bank. Interest rates have been at historical lows for several
years. As a result, new homes have been more affordable. Increases in interest rates or decreases in availability of mortgage financing, however, could reduce the market for new homes. Potential homebuyers may be less willing or able to pay the
increased monthly costs or to obtain mortgage financing that exposes them to interest rate changes. Lenders may increase the qualifications needed for mortgages or adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk. Even if potential customers
do not need financing, changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing. These factors could adversely affect the sales or pricing of our homes and
could also reduce the volume or margins in our financial services business. Beginning in early 2007, the availability of certain mortgage financing products became more constrained as the mortgage industry began to more closely scrutinize sub-prime,
Alt-A, and other non-conforming mortgage products. Our financial services business could also be impacted to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate through the various hedging strategies
we employ. Additionally, these developments have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on the overall demand for new housing and thereby on the results of operations for our homebuilding business.

In addition, the Federal Reserve has purchased a sizeable amount of mortgage-backed securities in part to stabilize mortgage interest
rates and to support the market for mortgage-backed securities. As the Federal Reserve reduces its holdings of mortgage-backed securities over time, the availability and affordability of mortgage loans, including the consumer interest rates for such
loans, could be adversely affected.

We also believe that the availability of FHA and VA mortgage financing is an important
factor in marketing some of our homes. The FHA has and may continue to impose stricter loan qualification standards, raise minimum down payment requirements, impose higher mortgage insurance premiums and other costs and/or limit the number of
mortgages it insures. The liquidity provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to the mortgage industry is also critical to the housing market. The impact of the federal government’s conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on the short-term
and long-term demand for new housing remains unclear. Any limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these agencies could adversely affect interest rates, mortgage financing, and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans.

Significant costs of homeownership include mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes, both of which are generally
deductible for an individual’s federal and, in some cases, state income taxes. Any changes to income tax laws by the federal government or a state government to eliminate or substantially reduce these income tax deductions, as has been
considered from time to time, would increase the after-tax cost of owning a home. Increases in real estate taxes by local governmental authorities also increase the cost of homeownership. Any such increases to the cost of homeownership could
adversely impact the demand for and sales prices of new homes.



Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to capital and cost
of capital.

The capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility in recent years. In many cases,
the markets have exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity for issuers. We need liquidity for future growth and development of our business. Without sufficient liquidity, we may not be able to purchase additional
land or develop land, which could adversely affect our financial results. One source of liquidity is our unsecured revolving credit facility. In the event the current challenging market conditions persist or we incur additional land-related charges
or other asset impairments, we may violate certain financial covenants in the credit facility. These violations, if not waived by the lenders or cured, could result in an optional maturity date acceleration by the lenders, which might require
repayment of any borrowings and replacement or cash collateralization of any letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility, and could also result in a default under our $3.4 billion of senior notes.

The ability to reach an agreement with our lenders or to seek alternative sources of financing, if necessary, would depend on a variety
of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the homebuilding industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that lenders could develop a negative
perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if the level of our business activity decreases further due to the market downturn. At December 31, 2010, we had cash and equivalents of $1.5 billion and no borrowings outstanding under
our unsecured revolving credit facility. However, our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient, and in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all.

Another source of liquidity includes our ability to use letters of credit and surety bonds pursuant to certain performance-related
obligations and as security for certain land option agreements and under various insurance programs. The majority of these letters of credit and surety bonds are in support of our land development and construction obligations to various
municipalities, other government agencies, and utility companies related to the construction of roads, sewers, and other infrastructure. If we are unable to obtain letters of credit or performance bonds when required, or the conditions imposed by
issuers increase significantly, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Competition for
homebuyers could reduce our deliveries or decrease our profitability.

The housing industry in the United States is
highly competitive. We compete primarily on the basis of location, price, reputation, design, community amenities, and the quality of our homes. We compete in each of our markets with numerous national, regional, and local homebuilders. This
competition with other homebuilders could reduce the number of homes we deliver or cause us to accept reduced margins in order to maintain sales volume.

We also compete with resales of existing or foreclosed homes, housing speculators, and available rental housing. Increased competitive conditions in the residential resale or rental market in the regions
where we operate could decrease demand for new homes and increase cancellations of sales contracts in backlog.

Supply shortages and
other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials could increase costs and delay deliveries.

The homebuilding industry is highly competitive for skilled labor and materials. Additionally, the cost of certain building materials,
especially lumber, steel, and concrete, is influenced by changes in global commodity prices. Increased costs or shortages of skilled labor and/or materials could cause increases in construction costs and construction delays. We generally are unable
to pass on increases in construction costs to those customers who have already entered into sale contracts as those sales contracts generally fix the price of the home at the time the contract is signed, which may be well in advance of the
construction of the home. Sustained increases in construction costs may, over time, erode our margins, and pricing competition for materials and labor may restrict our ability to pass on any additional costs, thereby decreasing our margins.

Our income tax provision and tax reserves may be insufficient if a taxing authority is successful in asserting positions that are
contrary to our interpretations and related reserves, if any.

Significant judgment is required in determining our
provision for income taxes and our reserves for federal, state, and local taxes. In the ordinary course of business, there may be matters for which the ultimate outcome is uncertain. Our evaluation is based on a number of factors, including changes
in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law,



Our income tax provision and tax reserves may be insufficient if a taxing authority is
successful in asserting positions that are contrary to our interpretations and related reserves, if any. (continued)

correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits, and effective settlement of audit issues. Although we believe our approach to determining the tax treatment is appropriate, no
assurance can be given that the final tax authority review will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provision and related tax reserves. Such differences could have a material adverse effect on our income tax
provision in the period in which such determination is made and, consequently, on our net income for such period.

We are
periodically audited by various federal, state, and local authorities regarding tax matters. Our current audits are in various stages of completion; however, no outcome for a particular audit can be determined with certainty prior to the conclusion
of the audit, appeal and, in some cases, litigation process. As each audit is concluded, adjustments, if any, are appropriately recorded in our financial statements in the period determined. To provide for potential tax exposures, we maintain tax
reserves based on reasonable estimates of potential audit results. However, if the reserves are insufficient upon completion of an audit, there could be an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.

We may not realize our deferred income tax assets.

The ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income, executing tax planning strategies, and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences.
We have recorded valuation allowances against our deferred income tax assets. The valuation allowance will fluctuate as conditions change.

Our ability to utilize net operating losses (“NOLs”), built-in losses (“BILs”), and tax credit carryforwards to offset our future taxable income and/or to recover previously paid taxes
would be limited if we were to undergo an “ownership change” within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “IRC”). In general, an “ownership change” occurs whenever the percentage of the stock
of a corporation owned by “5-percent shareholders” (within the meaning of Section 382 of the IRC) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned by such “5-percent
shareholders” at any time over the testing period.

An ownership change under Section 382 of the IRC would establish
an annual limitation to the amount of NOLs, BILs, and tax credit carryforwards we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any single year. The application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred tax assets
attributable to our NOLs, BILs, and tax credit carryforwards. We have not experienced an ownership change as defined by Section 382. To preserve our ability to utilize NOLs, BILs, and other tax benefits in the future without a Section 382
limitation, we adopted a shareholder rights plan, which is triggered upon certain transfers of our securities, and amended our by-laws to prohibit certain transfers of our securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing measures, there can be no assurance
that we will not undergo an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382.

As a result of the merger with Centex,
our ability to use certain of Centex’s pre-ownership change NOLs, BILs, or deductions is limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The applicable Section 382 limitation is approximately $68 million per year for NOLs,
losses realized on built-in loss assets that are sold within 60 months of the ownership change, and certain deductions. The limitation may result in a significant portion of Centex’s pre-ownership change NOLs, BILs, and tax credit carryforwards
or deductions not being available for our use.

We have significant goodwill and intangible assets. If the goodwill becomes impaired,
then our profits may be significantly reduced or eliminated and shareholders’ equity may be reduced.

We have
recorded significant goodwill and intangible assets related to prior business combinations. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets whenever facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We
also perform our annual impairment testing of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year. If the carrying value of goodwill or intangible assets is deemed impaired, the carrying value is written down to fair value. This would result in a charge to
our operating earnings. We recorded goodwill impairments of $656.3 million, $563.0 million, and $5.7 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively, and have $240.5 million and $175.4 million of goodwill and intangible assets, respectively, remaining
at December 31, 2010. If management’s expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly, additional impairments of either goodwill or intangible assets may occur.



Government regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and
homebuilding projects or affect our related financial services operations and adversely affect our business or financial results.

Our operations are subject to building, environmental, and other regulations of various federal, state, and local governing authorities. For our homes to qualify for FHA or VA mortgages, we must satisfy
valuation standards and site, material, and construction requirements of those agencies. Our compliance with federal, state, and local laws relating to protection of the environment has had, to date, no material effect upon capital expenditures,
earnings, or competitive position. More stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers, thereby increasing the cost of compliance.

New housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools, parks, streets, and other public improvements. These can cause an increase in the effective prices for our homes. In addition,
increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities, as recently experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding, can adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new
homes.

We also are subject to a variety of local, state, and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health,
safety, and the environment. The impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less
available. These matters may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance, remediation and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas.

Our financial services operations are also subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations. These include
eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs and compliance with consumer lending and similar requirements such as disclosure requirements, prohibitions against discrimination, and real estate settlement procedures. They may
also subject our operations to examination by applicable agencies. These may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes.

We are subject to claims related to mortgage loans we sold in the secondary mortgage market that may be significant.

Our mortgage operations have made certain representations and warranties related to mortgage loans sold in the secondary mortgage market that the loans sold meet certain requirements, including
representations as to underwriting standards, the type of collateral, the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan. Our mortgage operations may be, and have been,
required to repurchase loans and/or indemnify the investors that purchased the loans for losses due to material breaches of these representations and warranties. In addition, we entered into an agreement in conjunction with the wind down of
Centex’s mortgage operations, which originated its last loan in December 2009, that provides a guaranty for one major investor in loans originated by Centex’s mortgage operations. This guaranty provides that we will honor the
potential repurchase obligations of Centex’s mortgage operations related to breaches of similar representations in the origination of a certain pool of loans.

The repurchase liability we recorded is estimated based on several factors, including the level of current and estimated probable future repurchase demands made by investors, our ability to cure the
defects identified in the repurchase demands, and the severity of loss upon repurchase. While we believe that our current repurchase liability reserves are adequate, the factors referred to above, upon which we estimate our repurchase
liability, are subject to change in light of market developments, the economic environment and other circumstances, some of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that such reserves will not need to be increased in the
future.

Homebuilding is subject to warranty and other claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant.

As a homebuilder, we are subject to home warranty, construction defect, and other claims arising in the ordinary
course of business. We record warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built. We have, and require the majority of
our subcontractors to have, general liability, property, errors and omissions, workers compensation, and other business insurance. These insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self-insured
per occurrence and aggregate retentions, deductibles, and available policy limits. Through our

be

significant. (continued)

captive insurance subsidiaries, we reserve for costs to cover our self-insured and deductible amounts under these policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits, based on an analysis of our
historical claims, which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Because of the uncertainties inherent in these matters, we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage, our subcontractor arrangements, and our reserves
will be adequate to address all our warranty and construction defect claims in the future. Contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce, we may be responsible for applicable self-insured retentions, and some types of claims may not be covered
by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits. Additionally, the coverage offered by and the availability of general liability insurance for construction defects are currently costly and limited. We have responded to the recent increases in
insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our self-insured retentions and claim reserves. There can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted and become more costly. Additionally, we are exposed to counterparty
default risk related to our and our subcontractors’ insurance carriers. We seek to manage such risk by maintaining our policies with highly-rated carriers.

Natural disasters and severe weather conditions could delay deliveries, increase costs, and decrease demand for new homes in affected areas.

Our homebuilding operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather. The occurrence of natural
disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new home deliveries, increase costs by damaging inventories, reduce the availability of materials, and negatively impact the demand for new homes in affected areas. Furthermore, if our insurance does
not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events, our earnings, liquidity, or capital resources could be adversely affected.

Inflation may result in increased costs that we may not be able to recoup if demand declines.

Inflation can have a long-term impact on us because increasing costs of land, materials, and labor may require us to increase the sales prices of homes in order to maintain satisfactory margins. In
addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which have a negative impact on housing demand, in which case we may not be able to raise home prices sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation and our margins could
decrease.

Future terrorist attacks against the United States or increased domestic and international instability could have an adverse
effect on our operations.

A future terrorist attack against the United States could cause a sharp decrease in the
number of new contracts signed for homes and an increase in the cancellation of existing contracts. Accordingly, adverse developments in the war on terrorism, future terrorist attacks against the United States, or increased domestic and
international instability could adversely affect our business.



ITEM 1B.    UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

This Item is not applicable.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

Our homebuilding and corporate headquarters are located in leased office facilities at 100 Bloomfield Hills Parkway, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan 48304. Pulte Mortgage leases its primary office facilities

day-to-day operations.

Because of the nature of our homebuilding operations, significant amounts of property are held as
inventory in the ordinary course. Such properties are not included in response to this Item.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are involved in various legal and governmental proceedings incidental to our continuing business operations, many involving claims
related to certain construction defects. The consequences of these matters are not presently determinable but, in our opinion, after consulting with legal counsel and taking into account insurance and reserves, the ultimate liability is not expected
to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. However, to the extent the liability arising from the ultimate resolution of any matter exceeds our estimates reflected in the recorded reserves
relating to such matter, we could incur additional charges that could be significant.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

On
August 18, 2009, we completed the acquisition of Centex through the merger of PulteGroup’s merger subsidiary with and into Centex pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of April 7, 2009 among PulteGroup, Pi Nevada
Building Company, and Centex. As a result of the merger, Centex became a wholly-owned subsidiary of PulteGroup. Accordingly, the results of Centex are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the merger.

Since early 2006, the U.S. housing market has been unfavorably impacted by weak consumer confidence, tightened mortgage standards, and
large supplies of resale and new home inventories and related pricing pressures, among other factors. When combined with the significant foreclosure activity, a more challenging appraisal environment, higher than normal unemployment levels, and
uncertainty in the U.S. economy in recent periods, these conditions have contributed to sharply weakened demand for new homes, slower sales, and heightened pricing pressures to attract homebuyers. As a result, we have experienced a pre-tax loss in
each quarter since the fourth quarter of 2006. Such losses resulted from a combination of reduced operational profitability and significant asset impairments. Since the beginning of 2006, we have incurred total land-related charges of $5.5 billion
and goodwill impairments of $1.6 billion.

The U.S. housing market and broader economy remain in a period of uncertainty;
however, we are beginning to see signs of stabilization in certain of our local markets, though at near historically low levels. This more stable environment resulted in a significant reduction in the level of land-related charges recorded during
2010 compared with recent years. We believe our strategic merger with Centex positions us well for a recovery in the homebuilding industry. However, significant short-term uncertainty remains. The expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit
associated with the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 (“the Act”), which was applicable to orders under contract by April 30 and closed by September 30, 2010, favorably impacted our revenues for the first
half of 2010 but also contributed to industry-wide softness in new orders in the latter half of 2010.

Entering 2011, there
are indications that certain of the aforementioned negative trends may be slowing or improving. However, there are also a number of factors that may further worsen market conditions or delay a recovery in the homebuilding industry. Such factors
include:

•

High levels of unemployment, which are generally not expected to recede to historical levels during 2011, and associated low levels of consumer
confidence;

•

Continued high levels of foreclosure activity;

•

Potentially higher mortgage interest rates, which might result from a variety of macroeconomic factors, as the current level of historically low
mortgage interest rates is not believed to be sustainable for the long-term;

•

Increased costs and standards related to FHA loans, which continue to be a significant source of customer financing;

•

The overall impact of the federal government’s intervention in the U.S. economy, including the expiration of various economic stimulus programs;
and

•

Potential impacts of reforms to the overall U.S. financial services and mortgage industries that may have an adverse impact on the ability of our
customers to finance their home purchases or on our access to the capital markets, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act enacted into law on July 21, 2010 and the potential re-privatization of the
government-sponsored enterprises commonly known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Accordingly, we continue to
operate our business with the expectation that difficult market conditions will continue to impact us for at least the near term. While we are purchasing select land positions where it makes strategic and economic sense to do so, our targeted
profile for such investments consists of developed lots, frequently under rolling lot option contracts, that are cash flow positive early in the project cycle and accretive to earnings. We also continue to evaluate each existing land parcel to
determine whether the strategy and economics support holding the



Overview (continued)

parcel or disposing of it. We have closely evaluated and made significant reductions in employee headcount and overhead expenses since the beginning of the industry downturn and in conjunction
with the Centex merger. Due to the persistence of these difficult market conditions, improving the efficiency of our overhead costs will continue to be a significant area of focus. We are also adjusting the content in our homes to provide our
customers more affordable alternatives, including building homes with smaller floor plans in certain of our communities.

As a
result of the Centex merger, we have achieved significant savings in corporate and divisional overhead costs and interest costs for the combined entity. We have also achieved synergies in our purchasing leverage and integrating the combined
organization’s operational best practices. The Centex merger has contributed to growth through expanded geographic and customer segment diversity and the ability to leverage additional brands. We believe that the combination of our operational
improvement activities with the benefits of the Centex merger will help strengthen our market position and allow us to take advantage of opportunities that may develop in the future.

While signs of improvement for the overall U.S. economy, employment, and consumer confidence provide reasons for some level of optimism,
our outlook is tempered for 2011 as the timing of a sustainable recovery in the homebuilding industry remains uncertain. If the negative trends in economic conditions or financial market volatility experienced in recent years return either
nationally or to any of our local markets, it could adversely affect our business and results of operations in future periods, including a further reduction in the demand for housing as well as difficulties in accessing financing on acceptable
terms. Given these conditions and the continued weakness in new home sales, visibility as to future earnings performance is limited. Our evaluation for land-related charges recorded to date assumed our best estimates of cash flows for the
communities tested. If conditions in the homebuilding industry or our local markets worsen in the future, or if our strategy related to certain communities changes, we may be required to evaluate our assets, including additional projects, for
further impairments or write-downs, which could result in future charges that might be significant.

The following is a
summary of our operating results for 2010, 2009 and 2008 ($000’s omitted, except per share data):

•

The losses experienced by Homebuilding in 2010, 2009, and 2008 resulted primarily from significant charges related to the following ($000’s
omitted):



Overview (continued)

For additional information on each of the above, see the applicable Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Merger-related costs relates to transaction and integration costs directly related to the Centex merger. In total, Homebuilding incurred $123.7 million of such costs in 2009. These costs consisted of $57.0 million
of restructuring costs (primarily severance and lease exit costs) included in the above table within restructuring costs plus $66.6 million of investment banking and other professional fees, amortization of certain fair value adjustments, and
certain other integration costs.

In addition to the above charges, Homebuilding continued to experience declining revenues
(after adjusting for the incremental revenue resulting from the Centex merger) and challenged gross margins.

•

The Financial Services loss in 2009 resulted primarily from a significant increase in loan losses, including $60.9 million related to mortgage loan
repurchase obligations compared with $16.9 million and $2.4 million of such losses in 2010 and 2008, respectively (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The Financial Services loss in 2009 also included certain integration costs
directly related to the Centex merger totaling $8.4 million, which consisted primarily of severance benefits and lease exit and related asset impairment costs. After adjusting for these items, the reduced profitability in 2010 and 2009 compared with
2008 resulted primarily from significantly lower loan origination volumes due to the lower Homebuilding volumes.

•

Our other non-operating loss during 2010 increased compared with 2009 and 2008 primarily due to a $38.9 million loss realized on the repurchase of debt
in 2010 compared with $31.6 million in 2009 and $1.6 million in 2008 (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The other non-operating loss before income taxes in 2009 also included certain transaction and integration costs directly
related to the Centex merger totaling $5.4 million.

•

The income tax benefit in 2010 was primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain federal and state income tax matters. The income tax benefit in
2009 reflected the impact of the Act, which allowed us to carry back 2009 taxable losses to prior years and receive refunds of previously paid federal income taxes. The income tax benefit in 2008 primarily represented the tax benefit associated with
the taxable loss for that year.

•

The operating results for the year ended December 31, 2009 included Centex’s results for the period from August 19 to December 31,
2009 as follows ($000’s omitted):

The above operating results for Centex’s Homebuilding operations included the aforementioned goodwill
impairment charges of $563.0 million and the majority of the merger-related transaction and integration costs.



Homebuilding Operations

The following is a summary of loss before income taxes for our Homebuilding operations ($000’s omitted):

(a)

Includes homebuilding interest expense, which represents the amortization of capitalized interest. Home cost of revenues also includes land and community valuation
adjustments of $169.7 million, $751.2 million, and $1.2 billion for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

(b)

Includes net realizable value adjustments for land held for sale of $39.1 million, $113.7 million, and $271.1 million for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

(c)

Includes impairments of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, which totaled $1.9 million, $54.1 million, and $18.5 million for 2010, 2009, and 2008,
respectively.

(d)

Includes the write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs for land option contracts we no longer plan to pursue of $5.6 million, $54.3 million, and $33.3 million
for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Also includes goodwill impairment charges of $656.3 million, $563.0 million, and $5.0 million for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

(e)

Net new order units for the years ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 include Centex’s operations, which contributed approximately 6,400 and
2,900 units, respectively.

(f)

Net new order dollars represent a composite of new order dollars combined with other movements of the dollars in backlog related to cancellations and change orders.
Net new order dollars for the years ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 include $1.5 billion and $766.0 million related to Centex, respectively.

(g)

Backlog includes approximately 3,200 units and $822.6 million related to Centex at December 31, 2009.

As indicated above, the Centex merger had a significant impact on the operating results for 2010 and 2009. Excluding the impact of the
Centex merger, our revenues, unit settlements, and net new orders in both 2010 and 2009 would have experienced significant decreases from the respective prior year periods. Our reported home sale revenues, unit settlements, and net new orders for
2010 as reflected in the above tables represent decreases of 19%, 22%, and 28%, respectively, from the combined operating results of the two companies from 2009. However, these lower volumes were offset by lower land-related charges, improved gross
margins and operating leverage, and removal of the substantial majority of duplicative overhead costs from the combined companies. Excluding the impact of the goodwill impairments and insurance-related losses recorded in 2010 and 2009, our
Homebuilding loss before income taxes in 2010 was significantly improved from the losses reported by either company or the combined companies in the prior year periods. This illustrates the impact of the various actions we have taken to restructure
our combined homebuilding operations into a more efficient organization as well as the more stable environment that we believe the homebuilding industry has entered.



Homebuilding Operations (continued)

Home sale revenues for 2010, which include $1.9 billion related to Centex, were higher
than 2009 by $550.5 million, or 14%. In 2009, home sale revenues, which included $1.1 billion related to Centex, were lower than those for 2008 by $2.2 billion, or 35%. The increase in home sale revenues in 2010 over 2009 was mainly attributable to
increased unit settlements of 14% as average selling price remained stable from 2009 to 2010. The decrease in home sale revenues in 2009 from 2008 was attributable to a decrease in unit settlements of 29% combined with a decrease in the average
selling price of 9%. The lower average selling price in 2010 and 2009 compared with 2008 resulted from a combination of pricing pressures due to challenging industry conditions and a shift in the product and geographic mix of homes closed during the
periods, including an increased concentration in the first-time buyer segment resulting from the Centex merger along with adjusting the product offering in certain communities to better align with current market conditions.

Homebuilding gross profit margins from home sales in 2010 were 9.4%, compared with negative 10.5% in 2009 and negative 10.1% in 2008. The
improvement in our gross margin is largely due to the significant decrease in land and community valuation adjustments to $169.7 million in 2010, compared with $751.2 million in 2009 and $1.2 billion in 2008. Gross profit margins were also adversely
impacted in 2009 by the fair value adjustment related to homes under construction inventory acquired with the Centex merger. We recognized this fair value adjustment as an increase of $31.1 million to home cost of revenues as the related homes
closed. Home sale gross profit margins, excluding land and community valuation adjustments, amortization of capitalized interest, and merger-related costs, were 16.7% in 2010 compared to 12.3% in 2009 and 12.2% in 2008. The increase in gross margin
reflects a combination of factors, including shifts in the product and geographic mix of homes closed during the year, better alignment of our product offering with current market conditions, and our various initiatives to reduce the construction
cost of our homes. (See the Non-GAAP Financial Measure section for reconciliation of home sale gross profit margins, excluding land and community valuation adjustments, amortization of capitalized interest, and merger-related costs, to home sale
gross profit margins).

We continue to evaluate our existing land positions to ensure the most effective use of capital. Land
sale revenues and their related gains or losses may vary significantly between periods, depending on the timing of land sales. Land sales had a negative margin contribution of $25.7 million for 2010 and negative margin contributions of $113.9
million and $262.2 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. These margin contributions in 2010, 2009, and 2008 included net realizable value adjustments totaling $39.1 million, $113.7 million, and $271.1 million, respectively, related to land held
for sale.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a percentage of home sale revenues, were 19.4% in 2010 compared
with 16.3% in 2009 and 13.0% in 2008. This increase was largely the result of $280.4 million in insurance-related charges taken during 2010, substantially all of which related to general liability construction defect claims. Inclusive of this
charge, insurance-related expenses totaled $313.6 million, $34.9 million, and $103.5 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Excluding the charge recorded in 2010, insurance-related expenses decreased in 2010 and 2009 from 2008 primarily as
the result of lower revenues. We also experienced some adverse development in our projected general liability claims during 2008 that contributed to that year’s expense. Excluding such charges, our selling, general, and administrative expense
both in dollars and as a percentage of home sale revenues decreased significantly from 2009. Homebuilding selling, general, and administrative expense also included severance costs of $22.3 million in 2010. During 2009, Homebuilding selling,
general, and administrative expense included transaction and integration costs related to the Centex merger, including employee severance costs, totaling $65.0 million, as well as certain duplicative corporate and divisional overhead costs during
the transition period following the merger. Employee severance costs recorded to Homebuilding selling, general, and administrative expense during 2008 totaled $28.1 million. Overall, we have achieved significant reductions in overhead costs since
the Centex merger. However, our overhead leverage remains high relative to our sales volumes, so achieving a more efficient overhead structure remains an area of focus. In order to further reduce overhead cost and drive greater leverage, we
reconfigured our organization during the fourth quarter of 2010, reducing the number of operating areas from six to four and consolidating certain divisions. Along with these changes in our field operations, we also further reduced corporate and
support staffing across a number of functions to further consolidate and streamline our operating processes. We expect that these changes in our operating structure along with the completion of our integration activities related to the Centex merger
will significantly reduce our selling, general, and administrative costs in 2011.

Equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated
entities was $2.8 million, $(49.7) million, and $(12.9) million for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The primary cause for this change in results is the lower levels of impairments related to these entities in 2010 and 2008 compared with 2009.
The majority of our unconsolidated entities represent land development joint ventures, so the timing of income and losses can vary significantly between periods depending on the timing of transactions and circumstances specific to each entity.



Homebuilding Operations (continued)

Other income (expense), net includes the write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs
resulting from decisions not to pursue certain land acquisitions which totaled $5.6 million, $54.3 million, and $33.3 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. These write-offs vary in amount from year to year as we continue to evaluate
potential land acquisitions for the most effective use of capital. Other income (expense), net also includes lease exit costs and asset impairments related to overhead reduction efforts totaling $28.4 million in 2010 and $13.3 million in 2008. In
2009, other income (expense) included certain integration costs, including lease exit costs, directly related to the Centex merger totaling $27.5 million.

Other income (expense), net also includes goodwill impairment charges of $656.3 million, $563.0 million, and $5.0 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional discussion of these impairments.

For 2010, net new orders increased 7% to 15,148 units compared
with 14,185 units in 2009. The increase in net new order units was primarily attributable to the positive impact of the federal homebuyer tax credit in the first half of 2010 and incremental orders resulting from the Centex merger partially offset
in the latter half of 2010 by a lower average sales pace per community. For 2009, net new order units decreased 7% to 14,185 units compared with 15,306 units in 2008. Excluding Centex, net new order units decreased moderately during 2010 and
significantly during 2009 due to the uncertainty in the overall U.S. housing industry. Most markets continue to have significant resale and new home inventory on the market, and this, combined with low consumer confidence, difficulties experienced
by customers in selling their existing homes, the high rate of foreclosures, and the tighter mortgage financing market, has resulted in reduced net new orders. Cancellation rates were 19% in 2010, 23% in 2009, and 33% in 2008 as the cancellation
rate for 2010 reverted back to our more typical historical range compared with the heightened cancellation rates experienced during 2006 through 2008.

The dollar value of net new orders increased $190.8 million in 2010 compared to 2009 and decreased $393.0 million in 2009 compared to 2008. At December 31, 2010, we had 786 active selling
communities, a decrease of 11% from December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, we had 882 active selling communities, an increase of 54% from December 31, 2008. Centex contributed 435 active communities at December 31, 2009. Ending
backlog, which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed, was 3,964 units at December 31, 2010 with a dollar value of $1.1 billion compared with ending backlog of 5,931 units at December 31, 2009 with a dollar value of $1.6
billion.

We had 6,284 and 6,653 homes in production at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, excluding 1,452 and
1,657 model homes, respectively. Included in our total homes in production were 3,494 and 2,793 homes that were unsold to customers at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, of which 1,856 and 1,309 homes, respectively, were completed.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, our Homebuilding operations controlled 147,194 and 154,694 lots, respectively. Of these
controlled lots, 131,964 and 138,273 lots were owned and 10,082 and 14,208 lots were under option agreements approved for purchase at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In addition, there were 5,148 and 2,213 lots under option agreements
pending approval at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. While we are purchasing select land positions where it makes strategic and economic sense to do so, the reduction in lots resulting from unit settlements, land disposition activity,
and withdrawals from land option contracts exceeded the number of lots added by new transactions during the year ended December 31, 2010.

The total purchase price related to land under option for use by our Homebuilding operations at future dates approximated $709.5 million at December 31, 2010. These land option agreements, which may
be cancelled at our discretion, and may extend over several years, are secured by deposits and pre-acquisition costs totaling $95.1 million, of which only $3.1 million is refundable. This balance excludes contingent payment obligations which may or
may not become actual obligations to us.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This report contains information about our home sale gross profit margins, excluding land and community valuation adjustments,
amortization of capitalized interest, and merger-related costs, which is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the SEC’s rules and should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, home sale gross margin (which we
define as home sale revenues less home cost of revenues) as a measure of our operating performance. Management and our local divisions use this measure in evaluating the operating performance of each



Non-GAAP Financial Measures (continued)

community and in making strategic decisions regarding sales pricing, construction and development pace, product mix, and other daily operating decisions. We believe it is a relevant and useful
measure to investors for evaluating our performance through gross profit generated on homes delivered during a given period and for comparing our operating performance to other companies in the homebuilding industry. Although other companies in the
homebuilding industry report similar information, the methods used may differ. We urge investors to understand the methods used by other companies in the homebuilding industry to calculate gross margins and any adjustments thereto before comparing
our measures to that of such other companies.

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial
measure to home sale gross margin, a GAAP financial measure, which management believes to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to this non-GAAP financial measure ($000’s omitted):

(a)

Write-offs of capitalized interest related to land and community valuation adjustments are reflected in capitalized interest amortization.

(b)

Home sale gross margin was adversely impacted by the amortization of a fair value adjustment to homes under construction inventory acquired with the Centex merger.
This fair value adjustment is being amortized as an increase to home cost of revenues over the related home closings.

Homebuilding Segment Operations

Homebuilding, our core business, is engaged in the acquisition and development of land primarily for residential purposes within the continental United States and the construction of housing on such land
targeted for first-time, first and second move-up, and active adult home buyers. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we realigned the organizational structure for certain of our Areas. Accordingly, the operating data by segment have been reclassified to
conform to the current presentation. We conduct our operations in 67 markets, located throughout 29 states and the District of Columbia, and have presented our reportable Homebuilding segments as follows:



Homebuilding Segment Operations (continued)

We also have one reportable segment for our financial services operations which consists
principally of mortgage banking and title operations conducted through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries. Our Financial Services segment operates generally in the same markets as our Homebuilding segments.

The following table presents selected financial information for our homebuilding reporting segments ($000’s omitted):

(a)

Other homebuilding includes amortization of capitalized interest of $180.9 million, $165.4 million, and $210.7 million for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively,
goodwill impairments of $656.3 million, $563.0 million, and $5.0 million for 2010, 2009, and 2008, and adjustments to insurance reserves totaling $280.4 million in 2010.



Homebuilding Segment Operations (continued)

* Represents lots related to certain wind down operations acquired with the Centex merger.

East:

For 2010, East home sale revenues increased 25% compared with 2009 due to a 28% increase in unit settlements offset slightly by a 2%
decrease in average selling price. Excluding Centex, home sale revenues and settlements decreased slightly while average selling price increased slightly compared with 2009. The income before income taxes was primarily attributable to higher
revenues, increased gross margins (both including and excluding land-related charges), and improved overhead leverage compared with 2009, and a decrease in land-related charges to $18.4 million in 2010, compared with land-related charges of $224.9
million and impairments related to unconsolidated joint ventures totaling $31.1 million in 2009. Net new orders increased 9% compared with 2009. Excluding Centex, net new orders decreased moderately compared with 2009. The cancellation rate
decreased to 16% in 2010 compared with 19% in 2009.

East home sale revenues in 2009 decreased 33% compared with 2008 due to a
25% decrease in unit settlements combined with a 10% decrease in the average selling price, including significant home sale revenue reductions in our Northeast, Georgia, and Charlotte markets. Excluding Centex, home sale revenues and settlements
decreased significantly compared with 2008 while average selling price was flat. The increased loss before income taxes was primarily attributable to the reduction in revenues combined with higher land-related charges. East recorded land-related
charges of $224.9 million and impairments totaling $31.1 million related to unconsolidated joint ventures during 2009, compared with land-related charges of $220.6 million in 2008. Gross margins, excluding land-related charges, decreased slightly
during 2009. Net new orders for 2009 increased 3% compared with 2008 primarily due to the merger with Centex. The cancellation rate for 2009 was 19% compared with 29% in 2008.

Gulf Coast:

For 2010, Gulf Coast home sale revenues increased 28% compared
with 2009 due to a 26% increase in unit settlements combined with a 1% increase in the average selling price, though our North Florida market experienced a significant decrease in revenues. Excluding Centex, home sale revenues and settlements
decreased slightly and average selling price increased slightly compared with 2009. The significant decrease in loss before income taxes in 2010 was attributable to higher revenues and lower land-related charges, which totaled $63.6 million and
$261.3 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Gross margins including and excluding land-related charges increased moderately compared with 2009. Net new orders increased by 24% compared with 2009 primarily due to the Centex merger. Excluding
Centex, net new orders for 2010 decreased moderately from 2009. The cancellation rate in 2010 was 23% compared with 25% in 2009.

For 2009, Gulf Coast home sale revenues decreased 23% compared with 2008 due to a 15% decrease in unit settlements combined with a 9% decrease in the average selling price, including a significant
decrease in home sale revenues in our North and Central Florida markets. Excluding Centex, home sale revenues and settlements decreased significantly compared with 2008 and average selling price decreased slightly. The Gulf Coast area experienced an
increased loss before income taxes in 2009 compared with 2008 due to decreased home sale revenues and higher land-related charges, which totaled $261.3 million and $247.7 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Excluding land-related charges, gross
margins increased moderately compared with 2008. Net new orders increased by 5% compared with 2008, primarily due to the Centex merger. The cancellation rate in 2009 was 25% compared with 33% in 2008.



Homebuilding Segment Operations (continued)

Central:

For 2010, Central home sale revenues decreased less than 1% compared with 2009 due to a 6% decrease in unit settlements offset by a 6% increase in the average selling price. Excluding Centex, home sale
revenues and settlements decreased moderately while average selling price increased moderately compared with 2009. Our Arizona market continued to experience significant declines in volumes due to the challenging market conditions in the Phoenix
area. Central experienced a decreased loss before income taxes in 2010 compared with 2009 due to significantly higher gross margins (including and excluding land-related charges) and improved overhead leverage during 2010. In 2010, Central recorded
land-related charges totaling $40.8 million, compared to land-related charges of $174.8 million and impairments of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures of $19.3 million in 2009. Net new orders decreased by 8% compared with 2009 primarily due
to decreased demand in Arizona. Excluding Centex, net new orders for 2010 decreased significantly compared to 2009. The cancellation rate in 2010 was 14% compared with 23% in 2009.

Our Central segment faced difficult local economic conditions in the majority of its markets during 2009. Central home sale revenues
decreased 46% compared with 2008 due to a 41% decrease in unit settlements combined with a 10% decrease in average selling price, including a significant decrease in the Illinois market’s home sale revenues. Excluding Centex, home sale revenues
settlements decreased significantly compared with 2008 and average selling price decreased slightly. For 2009 and 2008, Central operating results were negatively impacted by land-related charges of $174.8 million and $493.9 million, respectively.
During 2009 the Central market also incurred charges of $19.3 million related to investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. Excluding land-related charges, gross margins decreased slightly compared with 2008. Net new orders in 2009 decreased 24%
compared with 2008. For 2009, cancellation rates were 23% compared with 32% for 2008.

West:

For 2010, West home sale revenues decreased 1% compared with 2009 due to a less than 1% decrease in both unit settlements and average
selling price, though our Las Vegas and Bay Area markets experienced significant declines in volumes. Excluding Centex, home sale revenues and settlements decreased moderately while average sales price increased less than 1% compared with 2009. The
decreased loss before income taxes in 2010 compared with 2009 is attributable to significantly higher gross margins (both including and excluding land-related charges), and lower land-related charges of $63.5 million in 2010 compared with $190.0
million in 2009. The loss before taxes in 2010 and 2009 also included impairment charges of $1.9 million and $1.2 million, respectively, related to unconsolidated joint ventures. Net new orders decreased by 4% in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily
due to declines in Las Vegas and Bay Area. Cancellation rates were 23% in 2010 compared with 25% in 2009.

West home sale
revenues decreased 35% in 2009 compared with 2008 due primarily to a 32% decrease in unit settlements and a 5% decrease in average selling price as the majority of our West markets experienced lower home sale revenues. Excluding Centex, home sale
revenues and settlements decreased significantly and average selling price decreased moderately compared with 2008. During 2009, the reduction in revenues was partially offset by higher gross margins in several of our markets, which also included
$190.0 million in land-related charges and a $1.2 million valuation adjustment related to unconsolidated joint ventures. The decreased loss before income taxes in 2009 was primarily due to significantly lower land-related charges and lower
impairments in unconsolidated joint ventures, which totaled $464.2 million and $15.4 million, respectively, in 2008. Excluding land-related charges, we experienced increased gross margins in each of our West markets, with the exception of the Bay
Area. Net new orders decreased by 11% in 2009 compared with 2008. Cancellation rates were 25% in 2009 compared with 41% in 2008.



Financial Services Operations

We conduct our Financial Services operations, which include mortgage and title operations, through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries.
We originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements, and then sell such mortgage loans monthly to outside investors. Also, we sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price
servicing sales contracts. The following table presents selected financial information for our Financial Services operations ($000’s omitted):

Operating as a captive business model primarily targeted to supporting our Homebuilding operations, the
operating results of our Financial Services operations are directly linked to Homebuilding. Since 2007, the mortgage industry experienced a significant shift away from subprime, Alt-A, and high loan-to-value loans brought about by investors’
reluctance to purchase these loans due to their perceived risk. This, among other things, has resulted in an overall tightening of lending standards and a shift toward agency production and fixed rate loans versus adjustable rate mortgages
(“ARMs”).

Our Homebuilding customers continue to account for substantially all loan production, representing 98% of
loan originations for 2010, 98% for 2009, and 99% for 2008. Total Financial Services revenues during 2010 increased 3% compared with 2009 primarily as a result of increased home settlement volumes in 2010 compared to 2009. Financial Services
revenues for 2009 decreased 22% compared with 2008 primarily as a result of lower loan origination volume due to lower home settlements within our Homebuilding operations. Interest income, which is included in mortgage operations revenues, was
moderately lower in 2010 than in 2009 due to the combination of lower interest rates and selling loans faster in 2010; and significantly lower in 2009 than in 2008, due to the decrease in loan origination volume. Revenues from our title operations
increased 9% in 2010 compared with 2009 due to increased home settlement volume, and increased 59% in 2009 compared with 2008 due to the Centex merger.

Agency production for funded origination principal was 99%, 99%, and 98% in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Within the funded agency origination principal, FHA loans were approximately 38%, 40%, and
25% in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Our capture rate for 2010 was 78% compared with 85% for 2009 and 92% for 2008. Our capture rate represents loan originations from our Homebuilding operations as a percentage of total loan opportunities from
our Homebuilding operations, excluding cash settlements. Our customers’ average FICO scores for 2010, 2009, and 2008 were 749, 743, and 739, respectively. At December 31, 2010, our loan application backlog was $558.8 million, compared with
$877.9 million at December 31, 2009.

Substantially all loan production in 2010, 2009, and 2008 consisted of fixed rate
loans, the majority of which are prime, conforming loans. We define prime loans as full documentation first mortgages with FICO scores of 621 or higher, Alt-A loans as non-full documentation first mortgages with FICO scores of 621 or higher, and
sub-prime loans as first mortgages with FICO scores of 620 or lower. The shift toward agency fixed-rate loans from ARMs and interest-only mortgages, a component of ARMs, has contributed to profitability as fixed rate loans generally result in higher
profitability due to higher servicing values, less competition, and structured guidelines that allow for expense efficiencies when processing the loan.

Income before income taxes increased significantly in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to lower expenses related to loan repurchase liabilities combined with improved operating efficiencies. Income
before income taxes decreased significantly in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to increased loan loss reserves, decreased loan



Financial Services Operations (continued)

origination volumes, and lower values of servicing rights. The 2009 loss before income taxes also includes certain integration costs directly related to the Centex merger totaling $8.4 million,
which consist primarily of severance benefits and lease exit and related asset impairment costs. Financial Services also incurred goodwill impairment charges of $0.7 million in 2008 but none in either 2009 or 2010.

Since we sell the majority of our loans monthly and retain only limited risk related to the loans we originate, our overall loan losses
have historically not been significant. In 2010 and 2009, however, we experienced higher than historical losses on our loans held for investment, repurchased or re-insured loans, and foreclosed properties. The largest source of these losses has been
a significant increase in anticipated losses for loans previously originated and sold to investors. Such losses may result from certain representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, including representations as to
underwriting standards, the type of collateral, the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan. If determined to be at fault, we either repurchase the loans from the
investors or reimburse the investors’ losses. We establish liabilities for such anticipated losses based upon, among other things, the level of current and estimated probable future repurchase demands made by investors, our ability to cure the
defects identified in the repurchase demands, and the severity of loss upon repurchase. Beginning in 2009, we have experienced a significant increase in anticipated losses as a result of the high level of loan defaults and related losses in the
mortgage industry and increasing aggressiveness by investors in presenting such claims to us. Additionally, Centex’s mortgage operations were historically broader than those of Pulte Mortgage, so our exposure to losses related to loans
previously originated increased significantly as a result of the Centex merger. While not increasing our exposure to Centex’s contingent loan origination liabilities, we entered into an agreement in conjunction with the wind down of
Centex’s mortgage operations, which originated its last loan in December 2009, that provides a guaranty for one major investor in loans originated by Centex’s mortgage operations. This guaranty provides that we will honor the potential
repurchase obligations of Centex’s mortgage operations related to breaches of representations and warranties in the origination of a certain pool of loans. Other than with respect to this pool of loans, our contractual repurchase obligations
are limited to our non-guarantor subsidiaries (see Note 17 for a discussion of non-guarantor subsidiaries).

The vast majority
of losses related to our overall exposure for loans previously originated and sold to investors relate to loans originated in 2006 and 2007 when industry lending standards were less stringent and borrower fraud is believed to have peaked. Given the
volatility in the mortgage industry and the uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims, it is reasonably possible that future losses may exceed our current estimates. Changes in these liabilities are as follows ($000’s
omitted):

In addition to the above, loan loss provisions related to our portfolio loans, real estate owned, and
mortgage reinsurance reserves totaled $1.2 million, $9.8 million, and $17.0 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

We
are exposed to market risks from commitments to lend, movements in interest rates, and cancelled or modified commitments to lend. A commitment to lend at a specific interest rate (an interest rate lock commitment) is a derivative financial
instrument (interest rate is locked to the borrower). In order to reduce these risks, we use other derivative financial instruments to economically hedge the interest rate lock commitment. These financial instruments can include cash forward
placement contracts on mortgage-backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury futures contracts, and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage-backed securities. We enter into one of the aforementioned
derivative financial instruments upon accepting interest rate lock commitments. The changes in the fair value of the interest rate lock commitment and the other derivative financial instruments are included in Financial Services revenues. We do not
use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.



Other Non-Operating

Other non-operating expenses consist of income and expenses related to corporate services provided to our subsidiaries. These expenses are incurred for financing, developing, and implementing strategic
initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies, and providing the necessary administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Accordingly, these results will
vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve. The following table presents a summary of other non-operating expenses ($000’s omitted):

The slight decrease in net interest income in 2010 compared with 2009 resulted from higher invested cash
balances and a corporate note receivable offset by lower interest rates. The decrease in net interest income in 2009 compared with 2008 resulted from significantly lower interest rates on our invested cash balances. The decrease in selling, general,
and administrative expenses for 2010 compared with 2009 is due primarily to the prior year period containing certain integration costs directly related to the Centex merger totaling $5.4 million. Other income (expense), net consists of gains
(losses) on debt retirements (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

We capitalize interest cost into
inventory during the active development and construction of our communities. Each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development. Interest expense is allocated over the
period based on the cyclical timing of unit settlements. Interest expensed to Homebuilding cost of revenues for 2010, 2009, and 2008 includes $27.6 million, $68.2 million, and $84.8 million, respectively, of capitalized interest related to inventory
impairments. During the second and third quarters of 2010, the level of our active inventory was lower than our debt level. Accordingly, $1.5 million of Homebuilding interest costs were expensed directly to interest expense in 2010. During 2009 and
2008, we capitalized all of our Homebuilding interest costs into inventory because the level of our active inventory exceeded our debt levels. Given the substantial reduction in debt that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010, our active inventory
exceeded our debt levels at December 31, 2010. While the amount of interest incurred and capitalized into homebuilding inventory will decline as the result of these debt retirements, the amount of interest expensed will actually increase in the
near term due to the amortization of previously capitalized amounts.

Information related to interest capitalized into
inventory is as follows ($000’s omitted):

* Homebuilding interest incurred includes interest on our senior debt, short-term borrowings, and other
financing arrangements and excludes interest incurred by our Financial Services segment and certain other interest costs.

Income Taxes

Our income tax assets and liabilities and related effective tax rate are affected by a number of factors, the most
significant of which is the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets and changes in our unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the effect of our valuation allowance and changes in our unrecognized tax benefits, our effective tax rates
for 2008 through 2010 are not meaningful as our income tax benefit is not correlated to the amount of our pretax loss. Our effective tax rates were a benefit of 11.2% for 2010 compared with a benefit of 40.1% and 12.4% for 2009 and 2008,
respectively.



Income Taxes (continued)

The income tax benefit for 2010 was primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain
federal and state income tax matters. Our 2009 income tax benefit of $792.6 million was primarily due to the impact of the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 (the “Act”), which was enacted into law on
November 6, 2009. The Act amended Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code to allow net operating losses realized in either tax year 2008 or 2009 to be carried back up to five years (previously limited to two years). The Act allowed us to
carry back 2009 taxable losses to prior years and receive refunds of previously paid federal income taxes. We recorded income taxes receivable of $867.3 million at December 31, 2009, related to the carryback of net operating losses pursuant to
the Act.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We finance our land acquisitions, development, and construction activities by using internally-generated funds and existing credit arrangements. We routinely monitor current and expected operational
requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate the use of available financing sources, including securities offerings. Based on our current financial condition and credit relationships, we believe that our operations and borrowing
resources are sufficient to provide for our current and foreseeable capital requirements. However, we continue to evaluate the impact of market conditions on our liquidity and may determine that modifications are appropriate if the current difficult
market conditions extend beyond our expectations or if we incur additional land-related charges.

At December 31, 2010,
we had cash and equivalents of $1.5 billion and no borrowings outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”). We also had $3.4 billion of senior notes outstanding. Other financing included limited
recourse land-collateralized financing totaling $0.6 million. Sources of our working capital include our cash and equivalents, our Credit Facility, and our unsecured letter of credit facility (the “LOC Agreement”). An additional source of
liquidity during 2010 was the receipt of federal tax refunds aggregating $934.7 million. Such refunds resulted primarily from the carryback of taxable losses provided by the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009.

We follow a diversified investment approach for our cash and equivalents by maintaining such funds with a diversified portfolio of banks
within our group of relationship banks in high quality, highly liquid, short-term investments, generally money market funds and federal government or agency securities. We monitor our investments with each bank on a daily basis and do not believe
our cash and equivalents are exposed to any material risk of loss. However, given the volatility in the global financial markets, there can be no assurances that losses of principal balance on our cash and equivalents will not occur.

Our ratio of debt to total capitalization, excluding our land-collateralized debt, was 61.4% at December 31, 2010, and 47.4% net of
cash and equivalents.

In June 2009, we entered into the LOC Agreement, a five-year, unsecured letter of credit facility that
permits the issuance of up to $200.0 million of letters of credit. The LOC Agreement supplements our existing letter of credit capacity included in our Credit Facility (described below). At December 31, 2010, $167.2 million of letters of credit
were outstanding under the LOC Agreement.

Given the difficult conditions in the homebuilding industry in recent years, we
have reduced the borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility as the result of a combination of reduced working capital needs and challenges in meeting the Credit Facility’s financial covenants. On December 23, 2010, we entered into the
Fifth Amendment to Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Fifth Amendment”), which decreased the borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility from $750.0 million to $250.0 million and also reduced the required level of cash and
equivalents to be maintained in certain liquidity reserve accounts. Previously, on December 11, 2009, we entered into the Fourth Amendment and Waiver to Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which reduced the borrowing capacity under the
Credit Facility from $1.2 billion to $750.0 million, replaced the maximum debt to capitalization ratio with a maximum debt to tangible capital limit, reduced the tangible net worth minimum, and waived any default under the previous Credit Facility
resulting from failure to comply with the tangible net worth financial covenant.

Under the terms of the Credit Facility, we
have the capacity to issue letters of credit totaling up to $250.0 million. Borrowing availability is reduced by the amount of letters of credit outstanding. The Credit Facility includes a borrowing base limitation when we do not have an investment
grade senior unsecured debt rating from at least two of



Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)

Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investor Service, and Standard and Poor’s Corporation (the “Rating Agencies”). We currently do not have investment grade ratings from any of the Rating
Agencies and are therefore subject to the borrowing base limitation. Given the uncertainty of current market conditions, we anticipate operating under the borrowing base limitation for the remainder of the Credit Facility’s term. Under the
borrowing base limitation, the sum of our senior debt and the amount drawn on the Credit Facility may not exceed an amount based on certain percentages of various categories of our unencumbered inventory and other assets. At December 31, 2010,
we had no borrowings outstanding and full availability of the remaining $28.4 million under the Credit Facility after consideration of $221.6 million of outstanding letters of credit. As a result, the borrowing base limitation did not restrict our
borrowing availability at December 31, 2010.

We are also required to maintain certain liquidity reserve accounts in the
event we fail to satisfy an interest coverage test. Specifically, if the interest coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) is less than 2.0 to 1.0, we are required to maintain cash and equivalents in designated accounts with certain banks.
While our access to and utilization of cash and equivalents maintained in liquidity reserve accounts is not restricted, failure to maintain sufficient balances within the liquidity reserve accounts restricts our ability to utilize the Credit
Facility. We maintained the required cash and equivalents of $250.0 million within the liquidity reserve accounts at December 31, 2010, calculated under the Credit Facility as two times the amount by which the interest incurred over the last
four quarters exceeds interest income over the last four quarters, excluding Financial Services, with a maximum amount of $250.0 million to be maintained in the liquidity reserve accounts effective with the Fifth Amendment. Additionally, failure to
satisfy the interest coverage test can also result in an increase to LIBOR margin and letter of credit pricing. Our interest coverage ratio for the quarter ended December 31, 2010 was negative 0.66. For the period ending March 31, 2011, we
will be required to maintain cash and equivalents of $250.0 million within the liquidity reserve accounts.

The Credit
Facility contains certain financial covenants. We are required to not exceed a debt to tangible capital ratio as well as to meet a tangible net worth covenant each quarter. At December 31, 2010, our debt to tangible capital ratio (as defined in
the Credit Facility) was 57.5% (compared with the requirement not to exceed 60.0%) while our tangible net worth (as defined in the Credit Facility) cushion was $436.2 million. Accordingly, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the
Credit Facility as of December 31, 2010. However, the required debt to tangible capital ratio adjusts to 57.5% as of both March 31 and June 30, 2011 and 55.0% as of the end of each quarter thereafter. In the event we are not able to
reduce our debt to tangible capital ratio below our current level, our compliance with the required covenant levels may be adversely impacted. Violations of the financial covenants in the Credit Facility, if not waived by the lenders or cured, could
result in an optional maturity date acceleration by the lenders, which might require repayment of any borrowings and replacement or cash collateralization of any letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility. In the event these violations
were not waived by the lenders or cured, the violations could also result in a default under our $3.4 billion of senior notes. Based on current market conditions, we believe that we may need to take action in order to avoid violating the debt to
tangible capital ratio, potentially as early as March 31, 2011. Possible actions could include: negotiating changes to the Credit Facility’s financial covenants with our group of lenders or arranging a new credit facility; terminating the
Credit Facility, which would release the funds currently maintained in the liquidity reserve accounts ($250.0 million) and using our available cash to collateralize required letters of credit ($221.6 million at December 31, 2010); or replacing
the Credit Facility with a separate letter of credit facility, similar to our existing LOC Agreement. While there can be no assurances that we could complete any of these actions given the uncertainties in the homebuilding industry and the financial
markets, we believe that the combination of these potential actions will allow us to avoid any violations of covenants under either the Credit Facility or senior notes for the near term.

Pulte Mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available pursuant to
certain third party and intercompany borrowings. Pulte Mortgage uses these resources to finance its lending activities until the mortgage loans are sold to third party investors, generally within 30 days. At December 31, 2009, Pulte Mortgage
had a combination of repurchase lending agreements in place with various banks that provided borrowing capacity totaling $175.0 million. Given our strong liquidity and the cost of third party financing relative to existing mortgage rates, Pulte
Mortgage allowed each of its third party borrowing arrangements to expire during 2010 and began funding its operations using internal Company resources. At December 31, 2010, we elected to fund $74.5 million of Pulte Mortgage’s financing
needs via a repurchase agreement with the Company. In order to satisfy regulatory requirements in certain states, Pulte Mortgage also maintains a $2.5 million repurchase lending agreement with a bank that expires in October 2011. There were no
borrowings outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2010.



Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)

Pursuant to the two $100 million stock repurchase programs authorized by our Board of
Directors in October 2002 and 2005, and the $200 million stock repurchase authorization in February 2006 (for a total stock repurchase authorization of $400 million), we have repurchased a total of 9,688,900 shares for a total of $297.7 million.
There have been no repurchases under these programs since 2006. We had remaining authorization to purchase common stock aggregating $102.3 million at December 31, 2010.

For the last three years, we have generated significant positive cash flow primarily through the liquidation of land inventory without a corresponding level of reinvestment combined with refunds of income
taxes paid in prior years. We have used this positive cash flow to, among other things, increase our cash reserves as well as retire outstanding debt. Over the last three years, we have retired $3.1 billion of debt, including debt assumed with the
Centex merger (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding these retirements). The majority of this debt was retired prior to its stated maturity. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we retired $898.5 million of
senior notes. Additionally, we voluntarily used $111.2 million to repurchase at a discount prior to their maturity certain community development district obligations with an aggregate principal balance of $124.1 million in order to improve the
future financial performance of the related communities (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and also voluntarily used $74.5 million of Company funds to finance Pulte Mortgage’s lending operations rather than continue to use
third party financing arrangements. However, we do not anticipate that we will be able to continue to generate positive cash flow at these same levels in the near future. Additionally, should growth conditions return to the homebuilding industry, we
will need to invest significant capital into our operations to support such growth.

Our net cash provided by operating
activities amounted to $580.3 million in 2010, $738.9 million in 2009 and $1.2 billion in 2008. During 2010, we received federal income tax refunds of $934.7 million compared with $362.0 million and $212.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively.
After adjusting for these tax refunds, operating cash flow was negative for 2010. Generally, the primary drivers of cash flow from operations are inventory levels and profitability. For the years ended 2008 through 2010, our net losses were largely
attributable to non-cash asset impairments, including land-related charges and goodwill impairments. Cash flows from operations in 2010 were negatively impacted by the voluntary repurchase of certain community development district obligations for
$111.2 million (see above) and using $74.5 million to internally finance Pulte Mortgage’s lending operations. During 2010, inventory levels and residential mortgage loans available-for-sale decreased slightly while operating cash flows in 2009
and 2008 benefited from a significant net decrease in inventory and residential mortgage loans available-for-sale

.

Net cash used by investing activities was $19.5 million at December 31, 2010, compared to net cash provided by investing activities
of $1.7 billion in 2009 and net cash used in investing activities of $55.9 million in 2008. The net cash used in 2010 was primarily the result of investments in unconsolidated entities and capital expenditures, partially offset by distributions from
unconsolidated entities and a reduction in residential mortgage loans held for investment. Our contributions to unconsolidated entities and investments in capital expenditures have declined in recent years as the result of the reduction in our
overall land investments. Substantially all of the cash provided by investing activities in 2009 was the result of cash acquired through the Centex merger. For 2008, the majority of the cash used by investing activities related to contributions to
our unconsolidated entities.

Net cash used in financing activities totaled $948.4 million, $2.2 billion, and $567.7 million
in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Net cash used in 2010 was primarily the result of the repurchase of senior notes as mentioned above as well as repayments made under Financial Services credit arrangements. The large increase in net cash used
in financing activities in 2009 was largely attributable to $2.0 billion used to retire outstanding debt combined with reductions in amounts outstanding under our Financial Services credit arrangements. Net cash used in 2008 was largely attributable
to the repurchase of outstanding senior notes combined with reductions in amounts outstanding under our Financial Services credit arrangements.

On November 24, 2008, our Board of Directors discontinued the regular quarterly dividend on our common stock effective in the first quarter of 2009.

Inflation

We, and the
homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation may also increase our financing, labor, and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest
rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective



Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)

Inflation (continued)

homebuyers. While we attempt to pass to our customers increases in our costs through increased sales prices, the current industry conditions have resulted in lower sales prices in substantially
all of our markets. If we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs, or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly, affecting our prospective homebuyers’ willingness or ability to adequately finance home
purchases, our revenues, gross margins, and net income would be adversely affected.

Seasonality

We experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry. Historically,
we have experienced significant increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home settlements. However, the challenging market conditions experienced since early 2006 have lessened the seasonal
variations of our results. Given the current significant uncertainty in the homebuilding industry, we can make no assurances as to when and whether our historical seasonality will recur.

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments

The following table
summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010:

(a)

Represents our senior notes and related interest payments.

(b)

Represents our limited recourse collateralized financing arrangements and related interest payments.

(c)

We do not have any payments due in connection with capital lease or long-term purchase obligations.

We are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts (including land option contracts) for the purchase,
development, and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business. Option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we are ready to build
homes on them. This reduces our financial risks associated with long-term land holdings. At December 31, 2010, we had agreements to acquire 15,230 homesites through option contracts. At December 31, 2010, we had $92.0 million of
non-refundable option deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to these agreements.

At December 31, 2010, we had
$258.0 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits and $48.4 million of related accrued interest and penalties. We are currently under examination by various taxing jurisdictions and anticipate finalizing the examinations with certain jurisdictions
within the next twelve months. However, the final outcome of these examinations is not yet determinable. The statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for tax years 1998-2010.

The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2010:

(a)

Includes capacity to issue up to $450.0 million in letters of credit, of which $388.9 million were outstanding at December 31, 2010. Excludes performance and
surety bonds of $1.7 billion, which typically do not have stated expiration dates.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We use letters of credit and performance and surety bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts, principally in connection
with the development of our projects. The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related homebuilding projects. If the obligations related to a project are ongoing, annual extensions of
the letters of credit are typically granted on a year-to-year basis. At December 31, 2010, we had outstanding letters of credit of $388.9 million. Performance bonds and surety bonds generally do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are
released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $1.3 billion at December 31, 2010, are typically outstanding over a period of approximately three to five years. We do not believe that there
will be draws upon any such letters of credit or performance or surety bonds.

In the ordinary course of business, we enter
into land option or option type agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future. At December 31, 2010, these agreements totaled approximately $709.5 million. Pursuant to these land option agreements, we provide
a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future, usually at predetermined prices. In certain instances, we are required to record the land under option as if we own it. At December 31,
2010, we consolidated certain land option agreements and recorded assets of $50.8 million as land, not owned, under option agreements.

At December 31, 2010, aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures was $15.5 million, of which our proportionate share of such joint venture debt was $5.1 million. Of our proportionate
share of joint venture debt, we provided limited recourse guaranties for $1.4 million of such joint venture debt at December 31, 2010. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

For 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recognized equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated entities of $2.9 million, $(49.7) million, and
$(12.8), respectively. The earnings (losses) in 2010, 2009, and 2008 included impairments related to investments in unconsolidated joint ventures totaling $1.9 million, $54.1 million, and $18.5 million, respectively.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its
application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates
about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures
included in the consolidated financial statements, giving due regard to materiality.

Revenue recognition

Homebuilding

– Homebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized at the time of the closing of the sale, when
title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. In situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by Pulte Mortgage, our wholly-owned mortgage subsidiary, and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing
investment as required by ASC 360-20, “Property, Plant, and Equipment - Real Estate Sales,” the profit on such sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a third-party investor has been completed unless there is a
loss on the sale in which case the loss on such sale is recognized at the time of closing.

Financial Services

–
Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors. Servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance, or a contracted set fee in the case of certain sub-servicing
arrangements, and are credited to income when related mortgage payments are received or the sub-servicing fees are earned. Loan origination fees, commitment fees, and certain direct loan origination costs are recognized as incurred. Expected gains
and losses from the sale of residential mortgage loans and their related servicing rights are included in the measurement of written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through Financial Services at the time of
commitment. Subsequent changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in Financial Services revenues as they occur. Interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold. Loans are placed on
non-accrual status once they become greater than 90 days past due their contractual terms. Subsequent payments received are applied according to the contractual terms of the loan.

Inventory valuation

Inventory is stated at the lower of accumulated cost
or fair value, as determined in accordance with ASC 360-10, “Property, Plant, and Equipment – Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“ASC 360-10”). Accumulated cost



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)

Inventory valuation (continued)

includes costs associated with land acquisition, land development, and home construction costs, including interest, real estate taxes, and certain direct and indirect overhead costs related to
development and construction. For those communities for which construction and development activities have been idled, applicable interest and real estate taxes are expensed as incurred. Land acquisition and development costs are allocated to
individual lots using an average lot cost determined based on the total expected land acquisition and development costs and the total expected home closings for the community. The specific identification method is used to accumulate home
construction costs.

We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories. Each layer of capitalized interest is
amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development. Interest expense is allocated over the period based on the cyclical timing of unit settlements.

Cost of revenues includes the construction cost, average lot cost, estimated warranty costs, and commissions and closing costs applicable
to the home. The construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home, plus an appropriate accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost. This accrual is reviewed
for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared with the amount accrued, and adjustments are made if needed. Total community land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared with actual
costs incurred to date and estimates to complete. The development cycles for our communities range from under one year to in excess of ten years for certain master planned communities. Adjustments to estimated total land acquisition and development
costs for the community affect the amounts costed for the community’s remaining lots.

In accordance with ASC 360-10, we
record valuation adjustments on land inventory when events and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired and when the cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. For communities that demonstrate
indicators of impairment, we compare the expected undiscounted cash flows for these communities to their carrying value. For those communities whose carrying values exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows, we calculate the fair value of the
community. Impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of the community’s inventory is less than its carrying value.

We generally determine the fair value of each community’s inventory using a combination of market comparable transactions, where available, and discounted cash flow models. These estimated cash flows
are significantly impacted by estimates related to expected average selling prices and sale incentives, expected sales paces and cancellation rates, expected land development and construction timelines, and anticipated land development,
construction, and overhead costs. Such estimates must be made for each individual community and may vary significantly between communities. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, the significant volatility in demand for new housing, and the
long life cycles of many communities, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates.

Investments in unconsolidated
entities

We have investments in a number of unconsolidated entities, including joint ventures, with independent third
parties. Many of these unconsolidated entities purchase, develop, and/or sell land and homes in the United States and Puerto Rico. The equity method of accounting is used for unconsolidated entities over which we have significant influence;
generally this represents partnership equity or common stock ownership interests of at least 20% and not more than 50%. Under the equity method of accounting, we recognize our proportionate share of the profits and losses of these entities. Certain
of these entities sell land to us. In these situations, we defer the recognition of profits from such activities until the time the related homes are sold. The cost method of accounting is used for investments in which we have less than a 20%
ownership interest and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence.

We evaluate our investments in
unconsolidated entities for recoverability in accordance with ASC 323, “Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures”. If we determine that a loss in the value of the investment is other than temporary, we write down the investment
to its estimated fair value. Any such losses are recorded to equity in (earnings) loss of unconsolidated entities in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additionally, each unconsolidated entity evaluates its long-lived assets, such as
inventory, for recoverability in accordance with ASC 360-10. Our proportionate share of any such impairments under ASC 360-10 are also recorded to equity in (earnings)



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)

Investments in unconsolidated entities (continued)

loss of unconsolidated entities in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Evaluations of recoverability under both ASC 323 and ASC 360-10 are primarily based on projected cash flows. Due to
uncertainties in the estimation process and the significant volatility in demand for new housing, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates.

Residential mortgage loans

In accordance with ASC 825, “Financial
Instruments” (“ASC 825”), we use the fair value option for our residential mortgage loans available-for-sale. ASC 825 permits entities to measure various financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on a
contract-by-contract basis. Election of the fair value option for residential mortgage loans available-for-sale allows a better offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without
having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. Changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in revenues as they occur.

Loans held for investment consist of a portfolio of loans that either have been repurchased from investors or were not saleable upon closing. These loans are carried at cost and reviewed for impairment
when recoverability becomes doubtful.

Mortgage loan allowances and loan origination liabilities

Our mortgage operations have established liabilities for anticipated losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to
investors that may result from certain representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, including representations as to underwriting standards, the type of collateral, the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the
validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan. We establish liabilities for such anticipated losses based upon, among other things, the level of current and estimated probable future repurchase demands made by investors,
our ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchase demands, and the severity of loss upon repurchase.

From time to
time, our mortgage operations will be required to repurchase certain loans we originated and sold to third parties. If a repurchased loan is performing, it is classified as a residential mortgage loan available-for-sale and recorded at fair
value. Such repurchased loans are typically re-sold to third party investors. If a repurchased loan is nonperforming, the loan is classified as loans held for investment. We establish an allowance for such loans based on our historical
loss experience and current loss trends.

Although we consider our mortgage loan allowances and loan origination liabilities to
be adequate, there can be no assurance that these allowances and liabilities will prove to be sufficient over time to cover ultimate losses in connection with our loan originations. These allowances and liabilities may prove to be inadequate
due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, the mortgage market, or discrete events adversely affecting specific borrowers.

Goodwill

We recorded a
significant amount of goodwill related to the Centex merger completed in 2009. Goodwill, which represents the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of the net assets at the acquisition date, is subject to annual impairment testing
in the fourth quarter of each year or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $563.0 million as part of our annual goodwill
impairment test. In addition to the annual impairment test in 2010, we performed an event-driven assessment as of September 30, 2010 in light of certain unfavorable indicators.

We test goodwill at the reporting unit level, which represents an operating segment or one level below. Because goodwill is assigned at
the reporting unit level after an acquisition and reflects the current overall operating structure of the business, it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition. We allocated goodwill resulting from the Centex merger to 24
reporting units, of which 23 reporting units related to our Homebuilding reporting segments and one reporting unit related to our Financial Services reporting segment. As a result of the impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2009 and impairment
tests in 2010, we have recorded cumulative impairments of the goodwill acquired with the Centex merger totaling $1.2 billion. As a result, our remaining goodwill totals $240.5 million at December 31, 2010 allocated amongst 13 of our
Homebuilding reporting units. Goodwill for the other 11 reporting units included in the original allocation of goodwill has been written-off due to either impairment or disposal.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)

Goodwill (continued)

We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill by following a two step process. Step one of
the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the carrying value of each of our reporting units to their estimated fair value. We determine the fair value of each reporting unit using accepted valuation methods, including the use of discounted
cash flows supplemented by market-based assessments of fair value. The fair values are significantly impacted by estimates related to current market valuations, current and future economic conditions in each of our geographical markets, including
the demand for new housing, and our strategic plans within each of our geographical markets. The discounted cash flow valuations involve the use of certain key assumptions, including projected revenue growth, profitability, and working capital
levels as well as market-based discount rates (a discount rate of 10.0% was used for all reporting units in the 2010 and 2009 goodwill impairment tests based on a market-based weighted-average cost of capital for the homebuilding industry). In
performing these valuations, we rely on our internal forecasts trended toward long-term averages that vary by reporting unit based on a combination of historical performance and our expectations for the future. Due to uncertainties in the estimation
process and the significant volatility in demand for new housing, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates. As a result of step one of the September 2010 goodwill impairment test, we determined that the carrying value exceeded
the fair value for the majority of our reporting units with goodwill. We perform step two of the goodwill impairment test for any reporting unit whose carrying value exceeds its fair value. Step two involves allocating the fair value of the
reporting unit to its assets and liabilities, with the excess representing implied goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized if the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill. As a result of Step 2 at both September 30, 2010 and
October 31, 2009, we determined that a significant portion of our goodwill balance was impaired. We also performed our annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill as of October 31, 2010, which determined that no additional
impairments existed.

The below table summarizes our 2010 goodwill impairment test results ($000’s omitted):

As reflected in the above table, $228.0 million of the goodwill remaining at December 31, 2010 (the sum
of lines (a) and (b)) relates to goodwill allocated to 11 reporting units that are at increased risk of future impairment. Our overall outlook and cash flow projections for each reporting unit involve the use of certain key assumptions, many of
which are interdependent upon each other. A change in any one or combination of these assumptions could impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit. If our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly or other
economic conditions deteriorate, goodwill may be further impaired. Also, while not directly triggering an impairment of goodwill, a significant decrease in our market capitalization in the future may indicate that the fair value of one or more of
our reporting units has decreased. Should subsequent analysis confirm that a decrease has occurred for one or more reporting units, an impairment of goodwill may result. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the fair value of each reporting unit
would have resulted in an additional impairment loss of approximately $159.9 million related to the 11 reporting units with goodwill balances remaining at December 31, 2010.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)

Goodwill (continued)

The below table summarizes the goodwill at increased risk of future impairment by
reportable segment as of December 31, 2010 ($000’s omitted):

We will continue to monitor each of our reporting units and perform goodwill impairment testing when events
or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. See Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of our goodwill impairment.

Intangible assets

We
have recorded intangible assets related to tradenames acquired with the Centex merger completed in 2009 and the Del Webb merger completed in 2001, which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives. The carrying values and ultimate
realization of these assets are dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use. If we determine that the carrying values of intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one
or more indicators of impairment, we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists. If the carrying values of the intangible assets exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows, then we measure impairment as the
difference between the fair value of the asset and the recorded carrying value. If our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly or if our strategy related to the use of such intangible assets changes, the related
intangible assets may be impaired.

Allowance for warranties

Home purchasers are provided with a limited warranty against certain building defects, including a one-year comprehensive limited warranty and coverage for certain other aspects of the home’s
construction and operating systems for periods of up to ten years. We estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our
warranty liability include the number of homes sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and the cost per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability for each geographic market in which we operate
and adjust the amounts as necessary. Actual warranty costs in the future could differ from our estimates.

Self-insured risks

We maintain, and require the majority of our subcontractors to maintain, general liability insurance coverage, including
coverage for certain construction defects. We also maintain property, errors and omissions, workers compensation, and other business insurance coverage. These insurance policies protect us against a portion of the risk of loss from claims. However,
we retain a significant portion of the overall risk for such claims either through policies issued by our captive insurance subsidiaries or through our own self-insured per occurrence and aggregate retentions, deductibles, and available policy
limits. The availability of general liability insurance for the homebuilding industry and its subcontractors has become increasingly limited and more expensive in recent years. In certain instances, we may offer our subcontractors the opportunity to
purchase insurance through one of our captive insurance subsidiaries or to participate in a project specific insurance program provided by us. Any policy issued by the captive insurance subsidiaries represents self-insurance of these risks by us.
While general liability coverage for the homebuilding industry is complex and our coverage varies significantly based on the policy year, in recent years we have generally been self-insured for $5.0 million to $7.5 million on a per occurrence basis
and up to $60.0 million on an annual aggregate basis, at which point our excess or reinsurance coverage begins.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)

Self-insured risks (continued)

We generally reserve for costs associated with insurance claims and their related
lawsuits (including expected legal fees) based on an actuarial analysis of our historical claims. The actuarial analysis includes an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. These estimates make up a significant portion of our estimates and are
subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors, including changes in claims reporting and resolution patterns, third party recoveries, insurance industry practices, the regulatory environment, and legal precedent. State
regulations vary, but construction defect claims are reported and resolved over an extended period often exceeding ten years. As a result, actual costs could differ significantly from estimated costs.

Adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs. Our recorded reserves for all
insurance claims totaled $813.8 million and $566.7 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, substantially all of which relates to general liability insurance. The increase in the liability at December 31, 2010 was due to
recording additional expense to insurance reserves during 2010 as a result of experiencing greater than anticipated frequency of newly reported claims and an increase in specific case reserves related to known claims for homes closed in prior
periods. Substantially all of these increases related to general liability reserves. The recorded reserves included an actuarial assessment of incurred but not reported claims, which represented approximately 76% and 75% of the total general
liability reserves at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Changes in the number and timing of reported claims and the estimates of specific claim values will significantly impact estimates of future reserves, which are reflected by the
incurred but not reported reserve.

In certain instances, we have the ability to recover a portion of its costs under various
insurance policies or from our subcontractors or other third parties. Estimates of such amounts are recorded when recovery is considered probable. The actuarial analyses of the reserves also consider historical third party recovery rates. Our
insurance policies are maintained with highly-rated underwriters for whom we believe counterparty default risk is not significant.

Stock-based compensation

We calculate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Determining the fair value of share-based
awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions, which involve a number of variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, the expected dividend yield,
and expected stock option exercise behavior. In addition, we also use judgment in estimating the number of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited.

Income taxes

We calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset
and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. In assessing the realizability of deferred
tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Our assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency, and magnitude of current and cumulative income
and losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryback or carryforward periods, our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards being used before expiration, and tax planning alternatives. The ultimate
realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. In determining the future tax consequences of events that have been
recognized in our financial statements or tax returns, judgment is required. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial
position.

We follow the provisions of ASC 740, “Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”), which prescribes a minimum
recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and
disclosure. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. Evaluations of our tax positions consider changes in facts or circumstances, changes in law, correspondence with taxing authorities, and settlements of audit issues.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK

We are subject to interest rate risk on our rate-sensitive financing to the extent long-term rates decline. The
following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, our rate-sensitive financing obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted-average interest rates, and estimated fair value ($000’s omitted).

Pulte Mortgage, operating as a mortgage banker, is also subject to interest rate risk. Interest
rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed-upon terms (i.e., commit to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to
an investor. During 2010 and 2009, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as
opposed to letting the interest rate float.

We minimize interest rate risk by hedging our loan commitments and closed loans
through derivative financial instruments. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgage-backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury future contracts, and options on cash forward
placement contracts on mortgage-backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in long-term mortgage rates
of plus 50, 100, and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results.

At December 31, 2010, our
aggregate net investment exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk includes our remaining non-operating investments in Mexico, which approximated $0.2 million.

Summary of significant accounting policies

Basis of presentation

On March 18, 2010, Pulte
Homes, Inc. changed its name to PulteGroup, Inc. (“PulteGroup”), a publicly-held holding company traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “PHM”. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
PulteGroup and all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (the “Company”) and variable interest entities in which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. While the Company’s subsidiaries engage primarily in the
homebuilding business, the Company also has mortgage banking operations, conducted principally through Pulte Mortgage LLC (“Pulte Mortgage”), and title operations.

On August 18, 2009, the Company completed the acquisition of Centex Corporation (“Centex”) through the
merger of PulteGroup’s merger subsidiary with and into Centex pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of April 7, 2009 among PulteGroup, Pi Nevada Building Company, and Centex. As a result of the merger, Centex became a
wholly-owned subsidiary of PulteGroup. Accordingly, the results of Centex are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of the merger.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

Reclassification

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Foreign currency

The financial statements of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries were measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries were translated at
exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses were translated at average exchange rates in effect during the year. Realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not significant during 2010, 2009, and 2008.

Subsequent events

The Company evaluated subsequent events up until the time the financial statements were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Cash and equivalents

Cash and equivalents include institutional money market investments and time deposits with a maturity of three months or less when acquired. Cash and cash equivalents also include $250.0 million and
$415.1 million maintained in liquidity reserve accounts as compensating balances at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. See Note 9.

Restricted cash

The Company maintains certain cash
balances that are restricted as to their use. Restricted cash consists of customer deposits on home sales which are temporarily restricted by regulatory requirements until title transfers to the homebuyer as well as certain other accounts with
restrictions.

Investments in unconsolidated entities

The Company has investments in a number of unconsolidated entities, including joint ventures, with independent third
parties. Many of these unconsolidated entities purchase, develop, and/or sell land and homes in



PULTEGROUP, INC.

Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Investments in unconsolidated entities (continued)

the United States and Puerto Rico. The equity method of accounting is used for unconsolidated entities over which the Company has significant influence; generally this represents ownership
interests of at least 20% and not more than 50%. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company recognizes its proportionate share of the profits and losses of these entities. Certain of these entities sell land to the Company. In these
situations, the Company defers the recognition of profits from such activities until the time the related homes are sold. The cost method of accounting is used for investments in which the Company has less than a 20% ownership interest and does not
have the ability to exercise significant influence.

The Company evaluates its investments in unconsolidated
entities for recoverability in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 323, “Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures” (“ASC 323”). If the Company determines that a loss in the value of the
investment is other than temporary, the Company writes down the investment to its estimated fair value. Any such losses are recorded to equity in (earnings) loss of unconsolidated entities in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additionally,
each unconsolidated entity evaluates its long-lived assets, such as inventory, for recoverability in accordance with ASC 360-10, “Property, Plant, and Equipment – Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“ASC 360-10”).
The Company’s proportionate share of any such impairments is also recorded to equity in (earnings) loss of unconsolidated entities in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Evaluations of recoverability under both ASC 323 and ASC 360-10 are
primarily based on projected cash flows. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process and the significant volatility in demand for new housing, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates. See Note 7.

Notes receivable

In certain instances, the Company may accept consideration for land sales or other transactions in the form of a note receivable. The counterparties for these transactions are generally land developers or
other strategic investors. The Company considers the creditworthiness of the counterparty when evaluating the relative risk and return involved in pursuing the applicable transaction. Due to the unique facts and circumstances surrounding each
receivable, the Company actively monitors each individual receivable separately and assesses the need for an allowance for each receivable on an individual basis. Factors considered as part of this assessment include the counterparty’s payment
history, the value of any underlying collateral, communications with the counterparty, knowledge of the counterparty’s financial condition and plans, and the current and expected economic environment. Allowances are recorded when it becomes
likely that some amount will not be collectible and are reported net of allowance for credit losses within other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Notes receivable are written off when it is determined that collection efforts will no longer
be pursued. Interest income is recognized as earned. The amount of impaired or past due notes receivable was not material at December 31, 2010.

The following represents the Company’s notes receivable and related allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2010 ($000’s omitted):

The Company also records other receivables from various parties in the normal course of
business, including amounts due from municipalities, insurance companies, and vendors. Such receivables are generally non-interest bearing and non-collateralized, payable either on demand or upon the occurrence of a specified event, and are
generally reported in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See

Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Intangible assets

Intangible assets consist of trademarks and tradenames acquired in connection with the 2009 acquisition of Centex and the
2001 acquisition of Del Webb. These intangible assets were valued at the acquisition date utilizing proven valuation procedures and are generally being amortized over a 20-year life. The acquired cost and accumulated amortization of the
Company’s intangible assets were $259.0 million and $83.6 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010, and $259.0 million and $70.5 million, respectively, at December 31, 2009. Amortization expense totaled $13.1 million in 2010, $14.0
million in 2009 (including $4.0 million related to the fair value of customer backlog acquired with the Centex merger that was fully amortized as of December 31, 2009), and $8.2 million in 2008. Amortization expense for trademarks and
tradenames is expected to be approximately $13.0 million in each of the next five years.

The ultimate
realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use. If we determine that the carrying values of intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one
or more indicators of impairment, we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists. If the carrying values of the intangible assets exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows, then we measure impairment as the
difference between the fair value of the asset and the recorded carrying value. If our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly or if our strategy related to the use of such intangible assets changes, the related
intangible assets may be impaired. There were no impairments of intangible assets during 2010, 2009, or 2008.

Goodwill

Goodwill, which represents the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of the net assets
at the acquisition date, has been recorded in connection with various acquisitions, though all remaining goodwill at December 31, 2010 and 2009 related to the Centex merger completed in 2009. Recorded goodwill has been allocated to the
Company’s reporting units based on the relative fair value of each acquired reporting unit. In accordance with ASC 350, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other”, the Company assesses the goodwill balance of each reporting unit for impairment
annually in the fourth quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. See Note 3.

Fixed assets and depreciation

Fixed assets are recorded
at cost. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method based upon estimated useful lives as follows: vehicles, three to seven years, model and office furniture, two to three
years, and equipment, three to ten years. Fixed assets are included in other assets and totaled $59.3 million net of accumulated depreciation of $237.0 million at December 31, 2010 and $82.4 million net of accumulated depreciation of $230.2
million at December 31, 2009. Depreciation expense totaled $32.5 million, $40.2 million, and $65.8 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

Advertising costs

Advertising costs are expensed as
incurred and totaled $54.9 million, $47.1 million, and $77.8 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

Employee
benefits

The Company maintains defined contribution retirement plans that cover substantially all of the
Company’s employees. Company contributions pursuant to the plans totaled $0.2 million, $5.7 million, and $15.1 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

Other expense (income), net

Other expense (income), net as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations consists of the following
($000’s omitted):

(a)

Excludes lease exit costs classified within Financial Services expenses of $2.9 million, $0.7 million, and $0.7 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

(b)

Excludes $0.7 million of goodwill impairments classified within Financial Services expenses in 2008.

Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders (the “numerator”) by the weighted-average number of common shares, adjusted for non-vested shares of
restricted stock (the “denominator”) for the period. Computing diluted earnings per share is similar to computing basic earnings per share, except that the denominator is increased to include the dilutive effects of options and non-vested
shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units. Any options that have an exercise price greater than the average market price are considered to be anti-dilutive, and are excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation. Due to the net
loss recorded during the periods, all stock options and non-vested restricted stock and restricted stock units were excluded from the calculation for 2010, 2009, and 2008.

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted the two-class method as required by ASC 260, “Earnings Per
Share” (“ASC 260”). Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the
two-class method. The two-class method determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends or dividend equivalents and their respective participation rights in undistributed earnings. The
Company’s outstanding restricted stock and restricted stock units are considered participating securities.

The following table presents the reconciliation of earnings per share (000’s omitted, except per share data):

Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Stock-based compensation

The Company measures compensation cost for its stock options at fair value on the date of grant and recognizes
compensation cost on the graded vesting method over the vesting period, generally four years. The graded vesting method provides for vesting of portions of the overall awards at interim dates and results in greater expense in earlier years than the
straight-line method. The fair value of the Company’s stock options is determined using primarily the Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of restricted stock is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of
the Company’s common stock. The Company recognizes compensation cost for restricted stock grants, the majority of which cliff vest at the end of three years, ratably over the vesting period. Compensation expense related to the Company’s
share-based awards is generally included in selling, general, and administrative expense within the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 11.

Income taxes

The provision for income taxes is calculated
using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. In assessing the
realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon
the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. In determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns,
judgment is required. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations or financial position.

The Company follows the provisions of ASC 740, “Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”), which prescribes a minimum
recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
and disclosure. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. The Company’s evaluations of tax positions consider changes in facts or circumstances, changes in law, correspondence with taxing authorities, and
settlements of audit issues.

Homebuilding revenue recognition

Homebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized at the time of the closing of the sale, when title to
and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. In situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by Pulte Mortgage and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment as required by ASC 360-20,
“Property, Plant, and Equipment - Real Estate Sales” (“ASC 360-20”), the profit on such sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a third-party investor has been completed, unless there is a loss on the
sale in which case the loss on such sale is recognized at the time of closing. Such amounts were not material at either December 31, 2010 or December 31, 2009.

Sales incentives

When sales incentives involve a discount
on the selling price of the home, the Company records the discount as a reduction of revenue at the time of house closing. If the sales incentive requires the Company to provide a free product or service to the customer, the cost of the free product
or service is recorded as cost of revenues at the time of house closing. This includes the cost related to optional upgrades and seller-paid financing or closing costs. Sales incentives in the form of seller-paid homeowners’ association fees or
merchandise are also recorded to cost of revenues.

Inventory

Inventory is stated at the lower of accumulated cost or fair value, as determined in accordance with ASC 360-10.
Accumulated cost includes costs associated with land acquisition, land development, and home construction costs, including interest, real estate taxes, and certain direct and indirect overhead costs related to development and construction. For those
communities for which construction and development activities have been idled, applicable interest and real estate taxes are expensed as incurred. Land acquisition and development costs are allocated to individual lots using an average lot cost
determined based on the total expected land acquisition and development costs and the total expected home closings for the community. The specific identification method is used to accumulate home construction costs.

Cost of revenues includes the construction cost, average lot cost, estimated warranty costs, and commissions and closing
costs applicable to the home. The construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home, plus an appropriate accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost. This
accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared with the amount accrued, and adjustments are made if needed. Total community land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs
compared with actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete. The development cycles for the Company’s communities range from under one year to in excess of ten years for certain master planned communities. Adjustments to estimated
total land acquisition and development costs for the community affect the amounts costed for the community’s remaining lots. See Note 5.

Land, not owned, under option agreements

In the ordinary
course of business, the Company enters into land option agreements in order to procure land for the construction of homes in the future. Pursuant to these land option agreements, the Company generally provides a deposit to the seller as
consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future, usually at predetermined prices. Under ASC 810, “Consolidation” (“ASC 810”), if the entity holding the land under option is a variable interest entity
(“VIE”), the Company’s deposit represents a variable interest in that entity. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, then the Company is required to consolidate the VIE.

The Company evaluates all land option agreements with VIEs to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary.
The VIE is generally protected from the first dollar of loss under the Company’s land option agreement due to the Company’s deposit. Likewise, the VIE’s gains are generally capped based on the purchase price within the land option
agreement. However, the Company’s maximum exposure to loss related to these VIEs is generally limited to the Company’s deposits and pre-acquisition costs under the applicable land option agreements, and creditors of the VIE have no
recourse against the Company. Also, the Company generally has little control or influence over the operations of these VIEs due to the Company’s lack of an equity interest in them. Therefore, when the Company’s requests for financial
information are denied, the Company is required to make certain assumptions about the assets, liabilities, and financing of such entities. In recent years, the Company has canceled a significant number of land option agreements, which has resulted
in significant write-offs of the related deposits and pre-acquisition costs but has not exposed the Company to the overall risks or losses of the applicable VIEs.

Generally, financial statements for the VIEs are not available. As a result, for VIEs the Company is required to
consolidate, the Company records the remaining contractual purchase price under the applicable land option agreement to land, not owned, under option agreements with an offsetting increase to accrued and other liabilities. Consolidation of these
VIEs has no impact on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows. At December 31, 2009, the Company determined that it was subject to a majority of the expected losses or entitled to receive a majority of the expected residual
returns under six of these agreements and consolidated $47.1 million as land, not owned, under option agreements with the corresponding liability classified within accrued and other liabilities. Upon the adoption of ASU 2009-17, “Amendments to
FASB Interpretation No. 46(R),” which became effective January 1, 2010, the Company determined that it did not have power to direct the most significant activities of these VIEs and, therefore, de-consolidated them. The Company did
not provide financial or other support to any VIEs other than as stipulated in the land option agreements.

Land, not owned, under option agreements (continued)

In addition to land option agreements consolidated under ASC 810, the
Company determined that certain land option agreements represent financing arrangements pursuant to ASC 470-40, “Accounting for Product Financing Arrangements” (“ASC 470-40”), even though the Company has no direct obligation to
pay these future amounts. As a result, the Company recorded $50.8 million and $127.1 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, to land, not owned, under option agreements with a corresponding increase to accrued and other
liabilities. Such amounts represent the remaining purchase price under the land option agreements in the event the Company exercises the purchase rights under the agreements.

The following provides a summary of the Company’s interests in land option agreements as of December 31, 2010
and December 31, 2009 ($000’s omitted):

(a)

Represents the remaining purchase price for land option agreements consolidated pursuant to either ASC 810 or ASC 470-40 under which the land seller is considered a
variable interest entity.

(b)

Represents the remaining purchase price for land option agreements consolidated pursuant to ASC 470-40 under which the land seller is not considered a variable
interest entity.

The above summary includes land option agreements consolidated under ASC
810 and ASC 470-40 as well as all other land option agreements. The remaining purchase price (total purchase price less deposit) of all land option agreements totaled $670.5 million and $599.8 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively.

Land held for sale

Land held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. See Note 5.

Start-up costs

Costs and expenses associated with entry into new homebuilding markets and opening new communities in existing markets are expensed when incurred.

Allowance for warranties

Home purchasers are provided with a limited warranty against certain building defects, including a one-year comprehensive
limited warranty and coverage for certain other aspects of the home’s construction and operating systems for periods of up to ten years. The Company estimates the costs to be incurred under these warranties and records a liability in the amount
of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect the Company’s warranty liability include the number of homes sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and the cost per claim. The Company
periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liability for each geographic market in which the Company operates and adjusts the amounts as necessary. Actual warranty costs in the future could differ from the current estimates.

Changes to the Company’s warranty liability were as follows ($000’s omitted):

Self-insured risks

The Company maintains, and requires the majority of its subcontractors to maintain, general liability insurance coverage,
including coverage for certain construction defects. The Company also maintains property, errors and omissions, workers compensation, and other business insurance coverage. These insurance policies protect the Company against a portion of the risk
of loss from claims, subject to certain self-insured per occurrence and aggregate retentions, deductibles, and available policy limits. However, the Company retains a significant portion of the overall risk for such claims. The Company reserves for
these costs on an undiscounted basis at the time product revenue is recognized for each home closing and evaluates the recorded liabilities based on actuarial analyses of the Company’s historical claims, which includes an estimate of claims
incurred but not yet reported. Adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs. In certain instances, the Company has the ability to recover a portion of its costs under various insurance policies
or from its subcontractors or other third parties. Estimates of such amounts are recorded when recovery is considered probable. See Note 16.

Residential mortgage loans available-for-sale

Substantially all of the loans originated by the Company are sold in the secondary mortgage market within a short period
of time after origination. In accordance with ASC 825, “Financial Instruments” (“ASC 825”), the Company uses the fair value option for residential mortgage loans available-for-sale. ASC 825 permits entities to measure various
financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on a contract-by-contract basis. Election of the fair value option for these loans allows a better offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to
economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. The Company does not designate any derivative instruments or apply the hedge accounting provisions of ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging.” Fair values for
conventional agency residential mortgage loans available-for-sale are determined based on quoted market prices for comparable instruments. Fair values for government and non-agency residential mortgage loans available-for-sale are determined based
on purchase commitments from whole loan investors and other relevant market information available to management. See Note 16 for discussion of the risks retained related to mortgage loan originations.

Residential mortgage loans available-for-sale (continued)

Expected gains and losses from the sale of residential mortgage loans
and their related servicing rights are included in the measurement of written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through Financial Services at the time of commitment. Subsequent changes in the fair value of these loans are
reflected in Financial Services revenues as they occur. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, residential mortgage loans available-for-sale had an aggregate fair value of $176.2 million and $166.8 million, respectively, and an aggregate outstanding
principal balance of $175.9 million and $166.4 million, respectively. The net gain (loss) resulting from changes in fair value of these loans totaled $1.9 million and ($3.9) million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
These changes in fair value were mostly offset by changes in fair value of the corresponding hedging instruments. Net gains from the sale of mortgages during 2010, 2009, and 2008 were $66.0 million, $59.5 million, and $85.8 million, respectively.

Mortgage servicing rights

The Company sells its servicing rights to third party investors monthly on a flow basis through fixed price servicing contracts. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 109, the Company
recognizes the fair value of its rights to service a mortgage loan as revenue at the time of entering into an interest rate lock commitment with a borrower. Due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held, the Company does not amortize
the servicing asset. The servicing sales contracts provide for the reimbursement of payments made by the purchaser if loans prepay within specified periods of time, generally within 90 to 120 days after sale. The Company establishes reserves for
this liability at the time the sale is recorded. Such reserves totaled $0.5 million and $1.8 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and are included in accrued and other liabilities. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, servicing rights
recognized in Financial Services revenues totaled $20.8 million, $29.3 million, and $44.0 million, respectively.

Loans
held for investment

The Company originates interim financing mortgage loans for certain of the
Company’s customers and also has a portfolio of loans that either have been repurchased from investors or were not saleable upon closing. These loans are carried at cost and reviewed for impairment when recoverability becomes doubtful. Loans
held for investment are included in other assets and totaled $3.1 million and $15.7 million (net of reserves of $3.1 million and $6.3 million) at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Interest income on mortgage loans

Interest income is recorded in Financial Services revenues, accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold, and totaled $5.8 million, $7.7 million, and $13.3 million in 2010,
2009, and 2008, respectively. Loans are placed on non-accrual status once they become greater than 90 days past due their contractual terms. Subsequent payments received are applied according to the contractual terms of the loan. Mortgage discounts
are not amortized as interest income due to the short period the loans are held until sale to third party investors. The fair value of mortgage loans held for sale at December 31, 2010 and 2009 reflects unamortized discounts of $1.0 million and
$1.1 million, respectively.

Mortgage servicing, origination, and commitment fees

Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors. Servicing fees are based on a
contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance, or a contracted set fee in the case of certain sub-servicing arrangements, and are credited to income when related mortgage payments are received or the sub-servicing fees are earned. Loan
origination costs related to residential mortgage loans available-for-sale are recognized as incurred in Financial Services expenses while the associated mortgage origination fees are recognized in Financial Services revenues as earned, generally
upon loan closing.

Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Title services

Revenues associated with the Company’s title operations are recognized within Financial Services revenues as closing
services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued, both of which generally occur as each home is closed. The Company has only limited risk associated with its title operations due to the low incidence of claims related
to underwriting risk associated with issued title insurance policies and fiduciary risk resulting from closing services.

Derivative instruments and hedging activities

The Company
is exposed to market risks from commitments to lend, movements in interest rates, and cancelled or modified commitments to lend. A commitment to lend at a specific interest rate (an interest rate lock commitment) is a derivative financial instrument
(interest rate is locked to the borrower). In order to reduce these risks, the Company uses other derivative financial instruments to economically hedge the interest rate lock commitment. These financial instruments can include cash forward
placement contracts on mortgage-backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury futures contracts, and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage-backed securities. The Company does not use any derivative
financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company enters into one of the aforementioned derivative financial instruments upon accepting interest rate lock commitments. The changes in the fair value of the interest rate lock commitment and the
other derivative financial instruments are recognized in current period earnings and the fair value is reflected in other assets or other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The gains and losses are included in Financial Services
revenues.

Fair values for interest rate lock commitments, including the value of servicing rights, are based
on market prices for similar instruments. At December 31, 2010, the Company had interest rate lock commitments in the total amount of $99.0 million, which were originated at interest rates prevailing at the date of commitment. Since the Company
can terminate a loan commitment if the borrower does not comply with the terms of the contract, and some loan commitments may expire without being drawn upon, these commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements of the Company.
The Company evaluates the creditworthiness of these transactions through its normal credit policies.

Cash
forward placement contracts on mortgage-backed securities are commitments to either purchase or sell a specified financial instrument at a specified future date for a specified price and may be settled in cash, by offsetting the position, or through
the delivery of the financial instrument. Whole loan investor commitments are obligations of the investor to buy loans at a specified price within a specified time period. Mandatory cash forward contracts on mortgage-backed securities are the
predominant derivative financial instruments used to minimize the market risk during the period from the time the Company extends an interest rate lock to a loan applicant until the time the loan is sold to an investor. Forward contracts are valued
based on market prices for similar instruments. Fair values for whole loan commitments are based on values in the Company’s whole loan sales agreements. At December 31, 2010, the Company had unexpired cash forward contracts and whole loan
investor commitments of $198.0 million and $59.0 million, respectively.

There are no credit-risk-related
contingent features within the Company’s derivative agreements, and counterparty risk is considered minimal. Gains and losses on interest rate lock commitments are offset by corresponding gains or losses on forward contracts and whole loan
commitments. At December 31, 2010, the maximum length of time that the Company was exposed to the variability in future cash flows of derivative instruments was approximately 75 days.

New accounting pronouncements

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (codified in
“ASC 820”), for its non-financial assets and liabilities and for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. ASC 820 provides a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting
principles, expands disclosures about fair value measurements, and establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The
adoption of ASC 820 for the Company’s non-financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, though it may in the future. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-4,
“Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly,” FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, “Recognition and Presentation
of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments,” and FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1, “Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments” (all codified in ASC 820). The Company adopted the FSPs as of January 2009, which did not have a
material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements” (codified in “ASC 810”). ASC 810 requires all entities to report noncontrolling (i.e. minority) interests in subsidiaries as equity in the
consolidated financial statements and to account for transactions between an entity and noncontrolling owners as equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest in the subsidiary. ASC 810 also requires expanded
disclosure that distinguishes between the interests of the controlling owners and the interests of the noncontrolling owners of a subsidiary. ASC 810 was effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2009. The adoption of ASC 810-10 did not
have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In June 2009, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 166, “Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140,” (codified in “ASC 860”). ASC 860 requires enhanced disclosures regarding transfers of financial assets and continuing
exposure to the related risks. ASC 860 also eliminates the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity and changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets. ASC 860 was effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2010. The
adoption of ASC 860 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167, “Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R),” (codified
in “ASU 2009-17”). ASU 2009-17 amended the consolidation guidance for variable interest entities (“VIEs”), requires ongoing reassessment to determine whether a VIE must be consolidated, and requires additional disclosures
regarding involvement with VIEs and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement. The Company adopted ASU 2009-17 as of January 1, 2010. As a result of the adoption, the Company de-consolidated six VIEs that were
consolidated at December 31, 2009, which reduced land, not owned, under option agreements and accrued and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets by $47.1 million.

In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 168,
“The

FASB Accounting Standards Codification

TM

and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles,” (codified in “ASC 105”), which created a single source of authoritative nongovernmental U.S. GAAP. The Codification was effective for the Company’s interim and
annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. Upon adoption, all existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards were superseded. All other non-SEC accounting literature not included in the Codification are considered non-authoritative.
The required disclosures have been incorporated into and did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-06, “Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements” (“ASU 2010-06”), amending ASC 820 to increase
disclosure requirements regarding recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. ASU 2010-06 will be effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2010, except for the disclosures about activity in Level 3 fair value
measurements which will be effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2011. ASC 820 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In July 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-20, “Disclosures about the Credit Quality of
Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses” (“ASU 2010-20”), amending ASC 310-10 to increase the disclosure requirements regarding financing receivables, including credit risk exposures and the allowance for credit
losses. The Company adopted ASU 2010-20 as of December 31, 2010. Disclosures related to activity that occurs during a reporting period will be effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2011.

Centex merger

On August 18, 2009, the Company completed the acquisition of Centex through the merger of PulteGroup’s merger subsidiary with and into Centex pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated
as of April 7, 2009 among PulteGroup, Pi Nevada Building Company, and Centex (the “Merger Agreement”). As a result of the merger, Centex became a wholly-owned subsidiary of PulteGroup. Accordingly, the results of Centex are included
in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of the merger.

Pursuant to the terms
and conditions of the Merger Agreement, PulteGroup acquired all of the outstanding shares of Centex common stock at the fixed exchange ratio of 0.975 shares of PulteGroup common stock for each share of Centex common stock. In addition, the majority
of the restricted shares of Centex common stock and restricted stock units with respect to Centex common stock granted under Centex’s employee and director stock plans vested and were converted per the exchange ratio into PulteGroup common
stock or units with respect to PulteGroup common stock. Each outstanding vested and unvested Centex stock option granted under Centex’s employee and director stock plans was converted into a vested option to purchase shares of PulteGroup common
stock, with adjustments to reflect the exchange ratio.

The Merger Agreement required that, with respect to
Centex stock options that were granted with an exercise price less than $40.00 per share, the terms of the converted, vested options to purchase shares of PulteGroup common stock provided that, if the holder of the option experiences a
severance-qualifying termination of employment during the two-year period following the completion of the merger, the stock option remained exercisable until the later of (1) the third anniversary of the date of the termination of employment
and (2) the date on which the option would cease to be exercisable in accordance with its terms (or, in either case, if earlier, the expiration of the scheduled term of the option). This provision will result in an immaterial amount of
incremental expense in the post-merger period.

The Centex merger was accounted for in accordance with ASC
805, “Business Combinations”. For accounting purposes, PulteGroup was treated as the acquirer, and the consideration transferred was computed based on PulteGroup’s common stock closing price of $12.33 per share on August 18,
2009, the date the merger



PULTEGROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Centex merger (continued)

was consummated. The acquired assets and assumed liabilities were recorded by PulteGroup at their estimated fair values, with certain limited exceptions. PulteGroup determined the estimated fair
values with the assistance of appraisals or valuations performed by independent third party specialists, discounted cash flow analyses, quoted market prices where available, and estimates made by management. To the extent the consideration
transferred exceeded the fair value of net assets acquired, such excess was assigned to goodwill.

The
following table summarizes the calculation of the fair value of the total consideration transferred and the final amounts recognized as of the merger date (000’s omitted, except per share data):

(a)

Reflects the portion of the fair value of the awards attributable to pre-merger employee service. The remaining fair value of the awards will be recognized in
PulteGroup’s operating results over the applicable periods.

(b)

Goodwill resulting from the Centex merger is not deductible for federal income tax purposes, though as of the merger date Centex had approximately $39 million of
goodwill deductible for tax purposes related to prior acquisitions.

Cash and equivalents,
other assets, accounts payable, and accrued and other liabilities were generally stated at historical carrying values given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. Because Centex had elected the fair value option under ASC 825 for its
residential mortgage loans available-for-sale, the historical carrying value of such assets equaled their fair value. Income tax receivables and liabilities were recorded at historical carrying values in accordance with ASC 805. The fair value of
assumed senior notes was determined based on quoted market prices.



PULTEGROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Centex merger (continued)

The Company determined the fair value of inventory on a
community-by-community basis primarily using a combination of market comparable land transactions, where available, and discounted cash flow models, though independent appraisals were also utilized in certain instances. These estimated cash flows
are significantly impacted by estimates related to expected average selling prices and sales incentives, expected sales paces and cancellation rates, expected land development and construction timelines, and anticipated land development,
construction, and overhead costs. Such estimates must be made for each individual community and may vary significantly between communities. See Note 5 for additional discussion of the factors impacting the fair value of land inventory.

The fair values for acquired intangible assets were determined based on valuations performed by independent valuation
specialists. Of the $100.0 million of acquired intangible assets, $96.0 million related to tradenames that will generally be amortized over 20 years. The remaining $4.0 million of acquired intangible assets related to acquired backlog at
August 18, 2009 and was amortized in 2009 as the related customer orders closed. Amortization expense for these assets totaled $5.0 million and $5.9 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, and is included in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations within other expense (income), net.

The Company completed its business combination accounting in
the second quarter of 2010. This resulted in an increase to goodwill of $2.5 million related to the completion of a final valuation of self-insurance liabilities assumed with the Centex merger.

As of the merger date, goodwill largely consisted of the expected economic value attributable to Centex’s deferred
tax assets and expected synergies resulting from the merger. Centex had $1.3 billion of deferred tax assets as of the merger date, which were substantially offset by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of realization. While the ultimate
realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of taxable income during future periods, such assets have a significant economic value given their long life and the Company’s expectations regarding future operating
results. As discussed in Note 12, a portion of the economic value of these deferred tax assets was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2009. The combined entity has also achieved significant savings in corporate and divisional overhead costs and
interest costs and synergies in the areas of purchasing leverage and integrating the combined organization’s operational best practices. The Company also anticipates opportunities for growth through expanded geographic and customer segment
diversity and the ability to leverage additional brands.

As of the merger date, the allocation of the final
goodwill balance to each of the Company’s reportable segments was as follows ($000’s omitted):

Transaction and integration costs

Transaction and integration costs directly related to the Centex merger, excluding the impact of restructuring costs and
acquisition accounting adjustments, totaled $40.9 million for 2009, the majority of which are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations within selling, general and administrative expenses. Such costs were expensed as incurred in
accordance with ASC 805. See Note 4 for a discussion of restructuring costs incurred in connection the Centex merger.

The
supplemental pro forma operating results have been determined after adjusting the operating results of Centex to reflect additional amortization that would have been recorded assuming the fair value adjustments to intangible assets had been applied
as of January 1, 2009, and 2008. Certain other adjustments, including those related to conforming accounting policies and adjusting acquired inventory to fair value, have not been reflected in the supplemental pro forma operating results due to
the impracticability of estimating such impacts. Additionally, given the significant volatility in the homebuilding industry in recent periods, such a presentation would not be indicative of future operating results.

3.

Goodwill

Goodwill, which represents the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of the net assets at the
acquisition date, has been recorded in connection with various acquisitions and is subject to annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. As further explained in Note 2, the Company recorded $1.5 billion of goodwill in connection with the Centex merger. All goodwill associated with prior transactions has been previously written-off. Management evaluates the recoverability
of goodwill by comparing the carrying value of the Company’s reporting units to their fair value. Fair value is determined using accepted valuation methods, including the use of discounted cash flows supplemented by market-based assessments of
fair value. Impairment is measured as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and its recorded carrying value. The determination of fair value is significantly impacted by estimates related to current market valuations,
current and future economic conditions in each of the Company’s geographical markets, and the Company’s strategic plans within each of its markets. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process and significant volatility in demand for new
housing, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates.

During the fourth quarter of 2009,
the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test. The determinations of fair value in allocating goodwill at the Centex merger date (August 18, 2009) and at the goodwill impairment assessment date (October 31, 2009) followed the same
process using similar long-term assumptions. The primary difference was that the valuation at the merger date was based on only the acquired Centex operations reconciled to the purchase price for the Centex merger while the valuation at the
assessment date was based on the integrated operations of each reporting unit reconciled to the Company’s overall market capitalization. This valuation approach at the assessment date was consistent with the Company’s operating structure
following the merger in that all acquired Centex operations were integrated with the PulteGroup operations and managed and forecasted at the local market level, not according to legacy operations.

As a result of the goodwill impairment test as of October 31, 2009, the Company determined that $563.0 million of
goodwill was impaired. This impairment resulted from a number of factors, including:

•

a significant decline in the Company’s overall market capitalization between the Centex merger date and the goodwill assessment date, which
implied that the fair values of the Company’s reporting units had decreased;



PULTEGROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

3.

Goodwill (continued)

•

the requirement under ASC 350 to allocate all goodwill to the Company’s reporting units even though a significant portion of the goodwill is
attributable to the economic value of deferred tax assets and corporate and financing synergies that are not directly reflected in the fair values of the individual reporting units; and

•

the relationship of the Company’s market capitalization to the Company’s stockholders’ equity, which were approximately equal. This
implied that some reporting units would likely have an excess of fair value above carrying value while others would have a deficiency, which is consistent with the impairment results.

As explained in Note 2, the Company recorded an increase of $2.5 million to goodwill in the second quarter of 2010 in
conjunction with completing its business combination accounting for the Centex merger. As a result, the Company reperformed the fourth quarter 2009 goodwill impairment test using the revised goodwill figure and recorded an additional impairment of
$1.4 million during 2010. During the second quarter of 2010, the Company also disposed of $1.6 million of goodwill in connection with the sale of the retail title operations acquired with the Centex merger.

The Company performed an event-driven assessment of the recoverability of goodwill as of September 30, 2010
following deterioration in market conditions, the Company’s operating results falling below previously forecasted levels, including an operating loss in the third quarter, certain actions taken to better align the Company’s overhead
structure with lower revenue volumes, and a sustained decline in the Company’s market capitalization. In performing the goodwill impairment analysis, the Company followed a similar approach as in 2009 using management’s best estimates of
the future cash flows for each reporting unit. The decline in the Company’s market capitalization occurred in spite of an increase in the Company’s tangible book value since the previous goodwill assessment as of October 31, 2009. The
increase in the Company’s tangible book value resulted primarily from income tax refunds and other tax-related matters. Accordingly, the implied fair value of the Company’s homebuilding business experienced an even more significant decline
than the Company’s market capitalization. The combination of these factors resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $654.9 million.

In addition to the event-driven assessment of goodwill at September 30, 2010, the Company performed its annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill as of October 31, 2010, which
determined that no additional impairments existed. However, if management’s expectations of future results and cash flows for any of its reporting units decrease, goodwill may be further impaired. Also, while not directly triggering an
impairment of goodwill, a significant decrease in the Company’s market capitalization in the future may indicate that the fair value of one or more of the Company’s reporting units has decreased, which may result in an impairment of
goodwill. Of the Company’s remaining goodwill of $240.5 million at December 31, 2010, $228.0 million relates to reporting units that are at increased risk of future impairment. Management will continue to monitor these reporting units and
perform goodwill impairment testing when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

Goodwill (continued)

The Company also recorded $5.7 million of goodwill impairment in 2008 as
a result of the deterioration in conditions in the homebuilding industry. Due to previous impairments, the Company’s goodwill balance at December 31, 2010 consists entirely of goodwill recorded in connection with the Centex merger.
Activity in the Company’s goodwill balances by reporting segment during 2010 and 2009 consisted of the following ($000’s omitted):

* Financial Services includes the disposal of $1.6 million related to the sale of the retail title
operations acquired with the Centex merger.

The Company’s accumulated goodwill impairment losses
totaled $1.6 billion and $938.7 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. This includes goodwill and impairments associated with the Centex merger as well as goodwill and impairments associated with previous acquisitions. The
goodwill associated with such previous acquisitions was fully impaired as of December 31, 2008. The Company records goodwill impairments to other expense (income), net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Restructuring

The Company has taken a series of actions both in response to the challenging operating environment and in connection with the Centex merger that were designed to reduce ongoing operating costs and
improve operating efficiencies. As a result of the combination of these actions, the Company incurred total restructuring charges as summarized below ($000’s omitted):

* Includes $65.4 million of restructuring costs related to the Centex merger.

Other than restructuring costs of $5.4 million in 2010 and $8.6 million in 2009 classified within Financial Services
expenses, employee severance benefits are included within selling, general and administrative expense while lease exit and other costs are included in other expense (income), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The remaining liability
for employee severance benefits and exited leases totaled $8.0 million and $41.7 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010 and $14.2 million and $38.6 million, respectively, at December 31, 2009. Substantially all of the remaining
liability for employee severance benefits will be paid within the next year, while cash expenditures related to the remaining liability for lease exit costs will be incurred over the remaining terms of the applicable office leases, which generally
extend several years. The restructuring costs relate to each of the Company’s reportable segments and were not material to any one segment.

Major components of the Company’s inventory at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were ($000’s omitted):

The Company capitalizes interest cost into inventory during the active development and
construction of the Company’s communities. Each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development. Interest expensed to Homebuilding cost of revenues for 2010, 2009, and
2008 includes $27.6 million, $68.2 million, and $84.8 million, respectively, of capitalized interest related to inventory impairments. During the second and third quarters of 2010, the level of the Company’s active inventory was lower than the
Company’s debt level. Accordingly, $1.5 million of Homebuilding interest costs was expensed directly to interest expense in 2010. During 2009 and 2008, the Company capitalized all of its Homebuilding interest costs into inventory because the
level of the Company’s active inventory exceeded the Company’s debt levels. Given the substantial reduction in debt that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010 (see Note 8), the Company’s active inventory exceeded the Company’s
debt levels at December 31, 2010.

Information related to interest capitalized into inventory is as
follows ($000’s omitted):

* Homebuilding interest incurred includes interest on senior debt, short-term borrowings, and other
financing arrangements and excludes interest incurred by the Financial Services segment and certain other interest costs.

Land valuation adjustments and write-offs

Impairment of long-lived assets

In accordance with ASC
360-10, the Company records valuation adjustments on land inventory and related communities under development when events and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired and when the cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less
than their carrying amounts. Such indicators include gross margin or sales paces significantly below expectations, construction costs or land development costs significantly in excess of budgeted amounts, significant delays or changes in the planned
development for the community, and other known qualitative factors. For communities that are not yet active, a significant additional consideration includes an evaluation of the regulatory environment related to the probability, timing, and cost of
obtaining necessary approvals from local municipalities and any potential concessions that may be necessary in order to obtain such approvals.

The Company also considers potential changes to the product offerings in a community and any alternative strategies for the land, such as the sale of the land either in whole or in parcels. The continued
weakened market conditions throughout the homebuilding industry have resulted in lower than expected revenues and gross margins. As a result, a portion of the Company’s land inventory and communities under development demonstrated potential
impairment indicators and were accordingly tested for impairment. As required by ASC 360-10, the Company compared the expected undiscounted cash flows for these communities to their carrying

value. For those communities whose carrying values exceeded the expected undiscounted cash flows, the Company calculated the fair value of the community. For such communities, impairment charges
are required to be recorded if the fair value of the community’s inventory is less than its carrying value.

The Company determined the fair value of the community’s inventory primarily using a combination of market comparable land transactions, where available, and discounted cash flow models. These
estimated cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates related to expected average selling prices and sales incentives, expected sales paces and cancellation rates, expected land development and construction timelines, and anticipated land
development, construction, and overhead costs. Such estimates must be made for each individual community and may vary significantly between communities. The assumptions used in our discounted cash flow models are specific to each community tested
for impairment and typically do not assume improvements in market conditions except in the latter years of long-lived communities. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, the significant volatility in demand for new housing, and the long
life cycles of many communities, actual results could differ significantly from such estimates. The Company’s determination of fair value also requires discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks
associated with each of the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. The discount rate used in determining each community’s fair value depends on the stage of development of the community and other specific factors that increase or
decrease the inherent risks associated with the community’s cash flow streams. For example, communities that are entitled and near completion will generally require a lower discount rate than communities that are not entitled and consist of
multiple phases spanning several years of development and construction activity.

The table below provides, as
of the date indicated, the number of communities in which the Company recognized impairment charges, the fair value of those communities at such date (net of impairment charges), and the amount of impairment charges recognized ($ in millions):

The Company recorded these valuation adjustments in its Consolidated Statements of
Operations within Homebuilding home cost of revenues. In 2010, the Company reviewed each of its land positions for potential impairment indicators and performed detailed impairment calculations for approximately 200 communities. The discount rate
used in the Company’s determination of fair value for the impaired communities ranged from 12% to 21%, with an aggregate average of 13%. If conditions in the homebuilding industry or the Company’s local markets worsen in the future, the
current difficult market conditions extend beyond the Company’s expectations, or the Company’s strategy related to certain communities changes, the Company may be required to evaluate its assets, including additional projects, for future
impairments or write-downs, which could result in future charges that might be significant.

Net realizable value
adjustments – land held for sale

The Company acquires land primarily for the construction of homes
for sale to customers but periodically sells select parcels of land to third parties for commercial or other development. Additionally, the Company may determine that certain of its land assets no longer fit into its strategic operating plans. In
such instances, the Company classifies the land asset as land held for sale, assuming the criteria in ASC 360 are met.

Inventory and land held for sale (continued)

Land valuation adjustments and write-offs (continued)

The Company values land held for sale at the lower of carrying value or
fair value less costs to sell. In determining the fair value of land held for sale, the Company considers recent legitimate offers received, prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions, and other factors. As a result of changing market
conditions in the real estate industry, a portion of the Company’s land held for sale was written down to net realizable value. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, the Company recognized net realizable value adjustments related to land held for sale
of $39.1 million, $113.7 million, and $271.1 million, respectively. The Company records these net realizable value adjustments in its Consolidated Statements of Operations within Homebuilding land cost of revenues.

availability and best use of necessary capital, and other factors. The Company wrote off (net of recoveries) deposits and pre-acquisition costs in the amount of $5.6 million, $54.3 million, and $33.3 million, during 2010, 2009, and 2008,
respectively. The Company records these write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs in its Consolidated Statements of Operations within other expense (income), net.

Segment information

The Company’s Homebuilding operating segments are engaged in the acquisition and development of land primarily for residential purposes within the continental United States and the construction of
housing on such land targeted for first-time, first and second move-up, and active adult home buyers. Home sale revenues for detached and attached homes were $3.5 billion and $936.6 million in 2010, $3.0 billion and $851.9 million in 2009, and $4.6
billion and $1.3 billion in 2008, respectively.

The Company has determined that its Homebuilding operating
segments are its Areas, each of which represents a reportable segment. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company realigned the organizational structure for certain of its Areas. The operating data by segment provided in this note have been
reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Accordingly, the Company’s reportable Homebuilding segments are as follows:

Segment information (continued)

The Company also has one reportable segment for its financial services
operations, which consist principally of mortgage banking and title operations. The Company’s Financial Services segment operates generally in the same markets as the Company’s Homebuilding segments.

Evaluation of segment performance is based on operating earnings from continuing operations before provision for income
taxes which, for the Homebuilding segments, is defined as home sales (settlements) and land sale revenues less home cost of revenues, land cost of revenues, and certain selling, general, and administrative and other expenses, plus equity income from
unconsolidated entities, which are incurred by or allocated to the Homebuilding segments. Operating earnings for the Financial Services segment is defined as revenues less costs associated with the Company’s mortgage and title operations and
certain selling, general, and administrative expenses incurred by or allocated to the Financial Services segment. Each reportable segment generally follows the same accounting policies described in Note 1 – “Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements.

Investments in unconsolidated entities

The Company participates in a number of joint ventures with independent third parties. Many of these joint ventures purchase, develop, and/or sell land and homes in the United States and Puerto Rico. A
summary of the Company’s joint ventures is presented below ($000’s omitted):

In 2010, 2009, and 2008, the Company recognized income (loss) from its unconsolidated joint
ventures of $2.9 million, $(49.7) million, and $(12.8) million, respectively. The income (loss) recognized during 2010, 2009, and 2008 includes impairments totaling $1.9 million, $54.1 million, and $18.5 million, respectively. During 2010, 2009, and
2008, the Company made capital contributions of $22.9 million, $35.1 million, and $54.6 million, respectively, to its joint ventures and received capital and earnings distributions of $9.7 million, $9.5 million, and $11.2 million, respectively, from
its joint ventures.

The timing of cash obligations under the joint venture and related financing agreements
varies by agreement and in certain instances is contingent upon the joint venture’s sale of its land holdings. If additional capital infusions are required and approved, the Company would need to contribute its pro rata portion of those capital
needs in order not to dilute its ownership in the joint ventures. While future capital contributions may be required, the Company believes the total amount of such contributions will be limited. The Company’s maximum financial loss exposure
related to joint ventures is unlikely to exceed the combined investment and limited recourse guaranty totals.

A terminated joint venture financing agreement required the Company and other members of one joint venture to guaranty
for the benefit of the lender the completion of the project if the joint venture did not perform the required development and an increment of interest in certain circumstances. This joint venture defaulted under its debt agreement, and the lender
has foreclosed on the joint venture’s property that served as collateral. During 2008, the lender also filed suit against the majority of the members of the joint venture, including the Company, in an effort to enforce the completion guaranty.
While the Company believes it has meritorious defenses against the lawsuit, there is no assurance that the Company will not be required to pay damages under the completion guaranty. The Company’s maximum exposure should be limited to its
proportionate share of the amount, if any, determined to be owed under such guaranties. Accordingly, the amount of any potential loss the Company might incur as a result of resolving this matter should not exceed the Company’s proportionate
share of the joint venture’s outstanding principal plus accumulated interest as of the date the lender foreclosed on the property, the Company’s proportionate share of which totaled approximately $52.2 million, representing 12% of the
total pre-foreclosure exposure of the joint venture, and which is excluded from the above table.

Additionally, the Company has agreed to indemnify the lenders for a joint venture with limited recourse guaranties for
certain environmental contingencies, and the guaranty arrangement provides that the Company is responsible for a proportionate share of the outstanding debt if the joint venture voluntarily files for bankruptcy.

Investments in unconsolidated entities (continued)

The Company would not be responsible under this guaranty unless the joint venture was unable to meet its contractual borrowing obligations or in instances of fraud, misrepresentation, or other
bad faith actions by the Company. To date, the Company has not been requested to perform under the bankruptcy or environmental guaranties described above.

In addition to the joint venture with limited recourse guaranties, the Company has investments in other unconsolidated entities, some of which have debt, including the Company’s joint ventures in
Puerto Rico, which are in the final stages of liquidation. The Company does not have any significant financing exposures related to these other entities.

Other financing arrangements

Corporate/Homebuilding

The Company maintains an unsecured
revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) in order to provide short-term financing for various working capital needs, primarily for letters of credit. The Credit Facility expires in June 2012. In recent years, the Company has
reduced its borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility as the result of a combination of reduced working capital needs and challenges in meeting the Credit Facility’s financial covenants. On December 23, 2010, the Company entered into
the Fifth Amendment to Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Fifth Amendment”), which decreased the Company’s borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility from $750.0 million to $250.0 million and also reduced the required
level of cash and equivalents to be maintained by the Company in certain liquidity reserve accounts. Previously, on December 11, 2009, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment and Waiver to Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement,
which reduced the borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility from $1.2 billion to $750.0 million, replaced the maximum debt to capitalization ratio with a maximum debt to tangible capital limit, reduced the tangible net worth minimum, and waived
any default under the previous Credit Facility resulting from failure to comply with the tangible net worth financial covenant. As a result of these and previous amendments to the Credit Facility, the Company recognized expense of $3.0 million in
2010, $2.9 million in 2009, and $3.7 million in 2008, which is included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations within selling, general and administrative expenses.

Under the terms of the Credit Facility, the Company has the capacity to issue letters of credit totaling up to
$250.0 million. Borrowing availability is reduced by the amount of letters of credit outstanding. The Credit Facility includes a borrowing base limitation when the Company does not have an investment grade senior unsecured debt rating from at
least two of Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investor Service, and Standard and Poor’s Corporation (the “Rating Agencies”). The Company currently does not have investment grade ratings from any of the Rating Agencies and is therefore
subject to the borrowing base limitation. Under the borrowing base limitation, the sum of the Company’s senior debt and the amount drawn on the Credit Facility may not exceed an amount based on certain percentages of various categories of the
Company’s unencumbered inventory and other assets. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had no borrowings outstanding and full availability of the remaining $28.4 million under the Credit Facility after consideration of $221.6 million of
outstanding letters of credit.

The Company is also required under the terms of the Credit Facility to
maintain certain liquidity reserve accounts in the event the Company fails to satisfy an interest coverage test. Specifically, if the interest coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) is less than 2.0 to 1.0, the Company is required to
maintain cash and equivalents in designated accounts with certain banks. While the Company’s access to and utilization of cash and equivalents maintained in liquidity reserve accounts is not restricted, failure to maintain sufficient balances
within the liquidity reserve accounts restricts the Company’s ability to utilize the Credit Facility. The Company maintained the required cash and equivalents of $250.0 million and $415.1 million within the liquidity reserve accounts at
December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, calculated under the Credit Facility as two times the amount by which the interest incurred over the last four fiscal quarters exceeds interest income over the last four fiscal quarters, excluding
Financial Services, with a maximum amount of $250.0 million to be maintained in the liquidity reserve accounts effective with the Fifth Amendment. Additionally, failure to satisfy the interest coverage test can also result in an increase to LIBOR
margin and letter of credit pricing.

The Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants. The Company is
required to not exceed a debt to tangible capital ratio as well as to meet a tangible net worth covenant each quarter. Violations of the financial covenants in the Credit Facility, if not waived by the lenders or cured, could result in an optional
maturity date acceleration by the lenders, which might require repayment of any borrowings and replacement or cash collateralization of any letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility. In the event these violations were not waived by the
lenders or cured, the violations could also result in a default under the Company’s $3.4 billion of senior notes.

Corporate/Homebuilding (continued)

As of December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with all of
the covenants under the Credit Facility. However, based on current market conditions, the Company may need to take action in order to avoid violating the debt to tangible capital ratio, potentially as early as March 31, 2011. Possible actions
could include: negotiating changes to the Credit Facility’s financial covenants with our group of lenders or arranging a new credit facility; terminating the Credit Facility, which would release the funds currently maintained in the liquidity
reserve accounts ($250.0 million) and using our available cash to collateralize required letters of credit ($221.6 million at December 31, 2010); or replacing the Credit Facility with a separate letter of credit facility.

The following is a summary of aggregate borrowing information related to the Credit Facility ($000’s omitted):

(a)

Reduced by letters of credit outstanding of $221.6 million, $500.6 million, and $353.3 million at December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

Excludes letters of credit outstanding of $388.9 million for 2010, $582.1 million for 2009, and $446.5 million for 2008.

(c)

Excludes letters of credit outstanding, which averaged $355.0 million, $407.1 million, and $392.1 million for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

In June 2009, the Company entered into a five-year, unsecured letter of credit facility
(the “LOC Agreement”) with Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch, which permits the issuance of up to $200.0 million of letters of credit by the Company. The LOC Agreement supplements the Company’s existing letter of credit capacity
included in the Credit Facility. The letters of credit will be used for general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries. Letters of credit may be issued to support the obligations of any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. At
December 31, 2010, $167.2 million of letters of credit were outstanding under this facility.

At
December 31, 2010 and 2009, other financing included limited recourse collateralized financing arrangements totaling $0.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively. These financing arrangements had maturities ranging primarily from one to three
years, a weighted-average interest rate of 6.5%, were collateralized by certain of the Company’s land positions, and had no recourse to any other assets of the Company. These arrangements are classified as accrued and other liabilities in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Financial Services

Pulte Mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of the Company’s home sales using its own funds and borrowings
made available pursuant to certain third party and intercompany borrowings. Pulte Mortgage uses these resources to finance its lending activities until the mortgage loans are sold to third party investors, generally within 30 days. At
December 31, 2009, Pulte Mortgage had a combination of repurchase lending agreements in place with various banks that provided borrowing capacity totaling $175.0 million. Given the Company’s strong liquidity position and the cost of third
party financing relative to existing mortgage rates, Pulte Mortgage allowed each of its third party borrowing arrangements to expire during 2010 and began funding its operations using

plans provide for the grant of options (both non-qualified options and incentive stock options as defined in each respective plan), stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, and restricted stock units to key employees of the Company or its
subsidiaries (as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors) for periods not exceeding ten years. Options granted to employees vest incrementally in periods ranging from six months to four years. Non-employee directors are
entitled to an annual distribution of shares of common stock, restricted stock units, and stock options. All options granted to non-employee directors are non-qualified, vest immediately, and are exercisable on the date of grant. Options granted to
non-employee directors are exercisable for ten years from the grant date. Restricted stock units are converted into shares of the Company’s common stock at distribution. Restricted stock units represent the right to receive an equal number of
shares of the Company’s common stock at the time the award is paid and were fully vested upon issuance.

A summary of the Company’s stock option activity for the three years ended December 31, 2010 is presented below

Stock compensation plans (continued)

The following table summarizes information about the weighted-average
remaining contractual lives of stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2010:

The
fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using primarily the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

The
Company has estimated the expected life of its share options using employees’ historical exercise behavior and the contractual term of these instruments in determining the fair value of its share options. Volatility is estimated using a
combination of implied volatility and historical volatility.

In connection with stock option awards, the
Company recognized compensation expense of $15.0 million, $22.1 million, and $15.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Total compensation cost related to non-vested stock option awards not yet recognized
was $8.6 million at December 31, 2010. These costs will be expensed over a weighted-average period of approximately three years. The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options that were exercised during 2010, 2009, and 2008 was $1.8 million,
$3.3 million, and $2.4 million, respectively. The intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option. As of December 31, 2010, there were no outstanding
options with intrinsic value.

The Company’s stock option participant agreements provide continued
vesting for certain eligible employees who have achieved a predetermined level of service based on their combined age and years of service. The Company records the related compensation cost for these awards over the period through the date the
employee first achieves the minimum level of service that would no longer require them to provide services to earn the award. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, the Company recorded $4.5 million, $5.6 million, and $3.9
million, respectively, of compensation expense related to stock option grants made to employees that have achieved this level of service, as well as those who will achieve this level of service during the vesting period.

A summary of the Company’s restricted stock activity for the three
years ended December 31, 2010 is presented below (000’s omitted, except per share data):

During 2010, 2009, and 2008, the total fair value of shares vested during the year
was $32.2 million, $48.1 million, and $46.2 million, respectively. In connection with the restricted stock awards, of which a majority cliff vest at the end of three years, the Company recorded compensation expense of $17.1 million, $24.2 million,
and $23.3 million during 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Total compensation cost related to restricted stock awards not yet recognized was $15.3 million at December 31, 2010. These costs will be expensed over a weighted-average period of
approximately two years.

A summary of the Company’s restricted stock unit activity for the three years
ended December 31, 2010 is presented below (000’s omitted, except per share data):

The restricted stock units granted during 2009 were done so in conjunction with
the Centex merger. The fair value of each restricted stock unit was calculated using the closing stock price on the date of grant and was included within the calculation of consideration transferred. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were
139,750 and 123,319, respectively, restricted stock units outstanding that had vested but had not yet been paid out because the payout date had been deferred by the holder.

The Company’s net deferred tax asset (liability) is as follows ($000’s omitted):



PULTEGROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Income taxes (continued)

The Company’s income tax benefit for 2010 was $137.8 million
compared with a benefit of $792.6 million and $209.5 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. These amounts represent effective tax rates of 11.2%, 40.1%, and 12.4% for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Due to the effects of the deferred tax
valuation allowance and changes in unrecognized tax benefits, the Company’s effective tax rates in 2010, 2009, and 2008 are not meaningful as the income tax benefit is not directly correlated to the amount of pretax loss.

The Company had income taxes receivable of $81.3 million and $955.2 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. Income taxes receivable at December 31, 2009 related primarily to the carryback of 2009 federal net operating losses under the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 (the “Act”), which was enacted
into law on November 6, 2009. The Act amended Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code to allow net operating losses realized in either tax year 2008 or 2009 to be carried back up to five years (previously limited to two years). The
Company received federal income tax refunds of $934.7 million during 2010. The income taxes receivable at December 31, 2010 generally relate to outstanding federal and state tax refunds from amended returns and net operating loss carrybacks.

Deferred tax assets primarily represent the deferred tax benefits arising from temporary differences between
book and tax income which will be recognized in future years as an offset against future taxable income. In accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” the Company evaluates its deferred tax assets to determine if a valuation allowance is
required. The Company had net deferred tax assets of $2.6 billion and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, which were offset entirely by valuation allowances due to the uncertainty of realizing such deferred tax assets. The
ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of taxable income during future periods. Changes in existing tax laws could also affect actual tax results and the valuation of deferred tax assets over
time. The accounting for deferred taxes is based upon an estimate of future results. Differences between the estimated and actual results could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial
position. To the extent that our results of operations improve, our deferred tax asset valuation allowance may be reduced, which could result in a non-cash tax benefit.

As a result of the Company’s merger with Centex, the Company’s ability to use certain of Centex’s
pre-ownership change net operating losses and built-in losses or deductions is limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company’s Section 382 limitation is approximately $68.0 million per year for net operating losses,
losses realized on built-in loss assets that are sold within 60 months of the ownership change, and certain deductions. The limitation may result in a significant portion of Centex’s pre-ownership change net operating loss carryforwards and
future recognized built-in losses or deductions not being available for use by the Company.

At
December 31, 2010, the Company had deferred tax assets including $592.3 million for federal and $287.5 million for state net operating loss carryforwards. The Company’s gross federal net operating loss carryforward is approximately $1.7
billion, a significant portion of which is subject to the provisions of Internal Revenue Code section 382. The Company also has significant gross state net operating losses in various tax jurisdictions. These net operating losses may be carried
forward from 5 to 20 years, depending on the tax jurisdiction, with losses expiring between 2011 and 2030.

At
December 31, 2010 the Company had $258.0 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $250.7 million would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. At December 31, 2009, the Company had $326.1 million of gross unrecognized tax
benefits, of which $291.0 million would affect the effective rate if recognized. Additionally, the Company had accrued interest and penalties of $48.4 million and $80.6 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2010 and 2009, the
Company’s income tax benefits included tax related interest and penalties. Such amounts totaled a benefit of $27.3 million in 2010 and expense of $3.4 million in 2009.

The Company is currently under examination by the IRS and various state taxing jurisdictions and anticipates finalizing
certain of the examinations within the next twelve months. The final outcome of these examinations is not yet determinable. It is reasonably possible, within the next twelve months, that the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by
up to $101.3 million, excluding interest and penalties, primarily due to expirations of certain statutes of limitations and potential settlements. The statute of limitations for the Company’s major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination
for tax years 1998 to 2010.

Fair value disclosures

ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” provides a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and establishes a fair value hierarchy which
requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value hierarchy can be summarized as follows:

The Company’s financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2010 and 2009
are summarized below ($000’s omitted):

See
Note 1 regarding the fair value of mortgage loans available-for-sale and derivative instruments and hedging activities.

Fair value disclosures (continued)

In addition, certain of the Company’s assets are required to be
recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company’s assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2010 and 2009 are
summarized below ($000’s omitted):

The
fair values included in the table above represent only those assets whose carrying values were adjusted to fair value in the current quarter. The Company measured certain of its loans held for investment at fair value since the cost of the loans
exceeded their fair value. Fair value of the loans was determined based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. For house and land inventory, see Note 5 for a more detailed discussion of the valuation methods used.

The carrying amounts of cash and equivalents approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature. The fair value
of senior notes outstanding totaled $3.2 billion compared with the carrying value of $3.4 billion. The fair values of senior notes are based on quoted market prices, when available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on
quoted market prices of similar issues. The carrying value of collateralized short-term financing agreements approximates fair value.

Net rental expense for 2010, 2009, and 2008 was $37.2 million, $48.7 million, and $67.1 million, respectively, excluding
lease exit costs presented in Note 4. Certain leases contain renewal or purchase options and generally provide that the Company shall pay for insurance, taxes, and maintenance.

Commitments and contingencies

Loan origination liabilities

The Company’s mortgage
operations have established liabilities for anticipated losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors that may result from certain representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, including
representations as to underwriting standards, the type of collateral, the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan. If determined to be at fault, the Company either
repurchases the loans from the investors or reimburses the investors’ losses. The Company establishes liabilities for such anticipated losses based upon, among other things, the level of current and estimated probable future repurchase demands
made by investors, the ability of the Company to cure the defects identified in the repurchase demands, and the severity of the loss upon repurchase. Beginning in 2009, the Company experienced a significant increase in anticipated losses as a result
of the high level of loan defaults and related losses in the mortgage industry and increasing aggressiveness by investors in presenting such claims to the Company. The vast majority of these losses relate to loans originated in 2006 and 2007 when
industry lending standards were less stringent and borrower fraud is believed to have peaked. Given the volatility in the mortgage industry and the uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims, it is reasonably possible that future
losses may exceed the Company’s current estimates. Changes in these liabilities are as follows ($000’s omitted):

As reflected above, the Company assumed loan origination liabilities totaling $56.3 million
effective with the Centex merger.

Commitments and contingencies (continued)

Mortgage reinsurance liabilities

A subsidiary of Pulte Mortgage operates as a re-insurer for a portion of the mortgage insurance written on loans
originated by Pulte Mortgage. Such reinsurance programs were discontinued effective January 1, 2009. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, reserves for potential claims under this program totaled $7.6 million and $9.1 million, respectively, and
are reflected in accrued and other liabilities.

Community development and other special district obligations

A community development district or similar development authority (“CDD”) is a unit of local
government created under various state statutes that utilizes the proceeds from the sale of bonds to finance the construction or acquisition of infrastructure assets of a development. A portion of the liability associated with the bonds, including
principal and interest, is assigned to each parcel of land within the development. This debt is typically paid by subsequent special assessments levied by the CDD on the landowners. Generally, the Company is only responsible for paying the special
assessments for the period in which it is the landowner of the applicable parcels. However, in certain limited instances the Company records a liability for future assessments that are fixed or determinable for a fixed or determinable period in
accordance with ASC 970-470, “Real Estate Debt”. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had recorded $73.3 million and $224.3 million, respectively, in accrued liabilities for outstanding CDD obligations. During 2010, the Company
voluntarily repurchased at a discount prior to their maturity CDD obligations with an aggregate principal balance of $124.1 million in order to improve the future financial performance of the related communities. The discount of $12.9 million will
be recognized as a reduction of cost of revenues over the lives of the applicable communities, which extend for several years.

Letters of credit and surety bonds

In the normal course of business, the Company posts letters of credit and surety bonds pursuant to certain performance-related obligations, as security for certain land option agreements, and under
various insurance programs. The majority of these letters of credit and surety bonds are in support of the Company’s land development and construction obligations to various municipalities, other government agencies, and utility companies
related to the construction of roads, sewers, and other infrastructure. At December 31, 2010 and 2009 the Company had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds totaling $1.7 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. In the event any such
surety bonds or letters of credit are called, the Company would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of the surety bond or letter of credit. The Company does not believe that a material amount, if any, of the surety bonds or letters of credit will
be called. The Company’s surety bonds generally do not have stated expiration dates. Rather, the Company is released from the surety bonds as the underlying performance is completed.

In addition, the Company is subject to $817.4 million of surety bonds related to certain construction obligations of
Centex’s previous commercial construction business, which was sold by Centex on March 30, 2007. The Company estimates that less than $85.0 million of work remains to be performed on these commercial construction projects. No event has
occurred that has led the Company to believe that these bonds will be drawn upon. Additionally, the purchaser of the Centex commercial construction business is the primary obligor for any potential losses relating to such surety bond obligations. As
additional security, the Company has purchased for its benefit a back-up indemnity provided by a financial institution with an investment grade credit rating. The obligation of such financial institution under the back-up indemnity is limited to
$400.0 million and terminates in 2016, if not previously terminated by the Company.

Litigation and regulatory matters

The Company is involved in various litigation and legal claims in the normal course of its business
operations, including actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants. The Company is also subject to a variety of local, state, and federal laws and regulations related to land development activities, house construction standards, sales
practices, mortgage lending operations, employment practices, and protection of the environment. As a result, we are subject to periodic examination or inquiry by various administering governmental agencies.



PULTEGROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

16.

Commitments and contingencies (continued)

Litigation and regulatory matters (continued)

The Company establishes a liability for potential legal claims and
regulatory matters when such matters are both probable of occurring and any potential loss is reasonably estimable. The Company accrues for such matters based on the facts and circumstances specific to each matter and revises these estimates as the
matters evolve. In such cases, there may exist an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts currently accrued. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of these legal and regulatory matters, the Company generally cannot predict
the ultimate resolution of the pending matters, the related timing, or the eventual loss. While the outcome of such contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not believe that the resolution of such matters will have a
material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial position, or cash flows of the Company. However, to the extent the liability arising from the ultimate resolution of any matter exceeds our estimates reflected in the recorded reserves
relating to such matter, we could incur additional charges that could be significant.

Self-insured risks

The Company maintains, and requires the majority of its subcontractors to maintain, general liability insurance coverage,
including coverage for certain construction defects. The Company also maintains property, errors and omissions, workers compensation, and other business insurance coverage. These insurance policies protect the Company against a portion of the risk
of loss from claims. However, the Company retains a significant portion of the overall risk for such claims either through policies issued by the Company’s captive insurance subsidiaries or through its own self-insured per occurrence and
aggregate retentions, deductibles, and available policy limits. The availability of general liability insurance for the homebuilding industry and its subcontractors has become increasingly limited and more expensive in recent years. In certain
instances, the Company may offer its subcontractors the opportunity to purchase insurance through one of the Company’s captive insurance subsidiaries or to participate in a project specific insurance program provided by the Company. Any policy
issued by the captive insurance subsidiaries represents self-insurance of these risks by the Company. While general liability coverage for the homebuilding industry is complex and the Company’s coverage varies significantly based on the policy
year, in recent years the Company is generally self-insured for $5.0 million to $7.5 million on a per occurrence basis and up to $60.0 million on an annual aggregate basis, at which point our excess or reinsurance coverage begins.

The Company generally reserves for costs associated with insurance claims and their related lawsuits (including expected
legal fees) based on an actuarial analysis of the Company’s historical claims. The actuarial analysis includes an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. These estimates make up a significant portion of the Company’s estimates and
are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors, including changes in claims reporting and resolution patterns, third party recoveries, insurance industry practices, the regulatory environment, and legal precedent. State
regulations vary, but construction defect claims are reported and resolved over an extended period often exceeding ten years. As a result, actual costs could differ significantly from estimated costs.

Adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs. The Company’s
recorded reserves for all insurance claims totaled $813.8 million and $566.7 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, substantially all of which relates to general liability insurance. The increase in the liability at
December 31, 2010 is due to the Company recording additional expense to insurance reserves during 2010 as a result of the Company experiencing greater than anticipated frequency of newly reported claims and an increase in specific case reserves
related to known claims for homes closed in prior periods, including several large claims. As a result of these unfavorable trends, the Company recorded additional expense to insurance reserves totaling $280.4 million ($0.74 per basic and diluted
share) during 2010 in the Consolidated Statements of Operations within selling, general, and administrative expenses (and included within “Reserves provided” for 2010 in the below table). Substantially all of these increases related to
general liability reserves. The recorded reserves included an actuarial assessment of incurred but not reported claims, which represented approximately 76% and 75% of the total general liability reserves at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. Changes in the number and timing of reported claims and the estimates of specific claim values will significantly impact estimates of future reserves, which are reflected by the incurred but not reported reserve.

Self-insured risks (continued)

Changes in these liabilities are as follows ($000’s omitted):

The Company experienced a high level of insurance-related expenses in 2010, 2009, and 2008,
primarily due to the adverse development of construction defect claims, the frequency and severity of which have increased significantly in recent years. Effective with the Centex merger, the Company assumed insurance-related liabilities of $271.1
million, which were increased by $2.5 million upon completion of a final valuation in 2010.

In certain
instances, the Company has the ability to recover a portion of its costs under various insurance policies or from its subcontractors or other third parties. Estimates of such amounts are recorded when recovery is considered probable. The actuarial
analyses of the reserves also consider historical third party recovery rates. The Company’s insurance policies are maintained with highly-rated underwriters for whom the Company believes counterparty default risk is not significant.

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

of
PulteGroup, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PulteGroup, Inc. (the “Company”) as of
December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of PulteGroup,
Inc. at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), PulteGroup, Inc.’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 10, 2011

reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control and effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Additionally, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time.

In order to ensure that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective, management regularly assesses such
controls and did so most recently for its financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. Management’s assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control – Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management asserts that the Company has maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.

Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company’s consolidated
financial statements included in this annual report, has issued its report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.



Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (continued)

(b)

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of PulteGroup, Inc.

We have audited PulteGroup,
Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO
criteria). PulteGroup, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, PulteGroup, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on

the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of PulteGroup, Inc. as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity
and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 and our report dated February 10, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
