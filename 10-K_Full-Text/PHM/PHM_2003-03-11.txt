PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Pulte Homes, Inc.

Pulte Homes, Inc. (Pulte) is a publicly held holding company whose
subsidiaries engage in the homebuilding and financial services businesses. Our
assets consist principally of the capital stock of our subsidiaries, cash and
investments. Our income primarily consists of dividends from our subsidiaries
and interest on investments. Our direct subsidiaries include Pulte Diversified
Companies, Inc. (PDCI), Del Webb Corporation (Del Webb) and other subsidiaries
engaged in the homebuilding business. PDCI’s operating subsidiaries include
Pulte Home Corporation (PHC), Pulte International Corporation (International)
and other subsidiaries engaged in the homebuilding business. PDCI’s
non-operating thrift subsidiary, First Heights Bank, fsb (First Heights), is
classified as a discontinued operation (see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements). We also have a mortgage banking company, Pulte Mortgage
Corporation (Pulte Mortgage), which is a subsidiary of PHC. Effective January
1, 2003, Pulte Mortgage changed its legal form of entity to a limited liability
company under the name Pulte Mortgage, LLC.

We have three reportable business segments: Homebuilding, Financial
Services and Corporate. The Homebuilding segment consists of the following two
business units:

•

Domestic Homebuilding, our core business, is engaged in the
acquisition and development of land primarily for residential purposes
within the continental United States and the construction of housing on
such land targeted for the first-time, first and second move-up, and
active adult home buyer groups.

•

International Homebuilding is primarily engaged in the acquisition
and development of land primarily for residential purposes, and the
construction of housing on such land in Mexico, Puerto Rico and
Argentina.

The Financial Services segment consists primarily of mortgage banking and
title operations conducted through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries.

Corporate is a non-operating business segment whose primary purpose is to
support the operations of our subsidiaries as the internal source of financing,
to develop and implement strategic initiatives centered on new business
development and operating efficiencies, and to provide the administrative
support associated with being a publicly traded entity listed on the New York
Stock Exchange.

Financial information, including revenue, pre-tax income and identifiable
assets of each of our business segments is included in Note 2 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.



Homebuilding Operations

Unit sales (settlements) and net new orders in any year are strongly
influenced by local, regional and national market economic conditions.

Domestic Homebuilding

We build a wide variety of homes, including single family detached units,
townhouses, condominiums and duplexes, with varying prices, models, options and
lot sizes. Since 1990, we have more than quadrupled our annual unit closings,
unit orders and unit backlog levels. Including 2002 sales of nearly 29,000
homes, we have closed more than 300,000 homes since our inception.

On July 31, 2001, we merged with Del Webb in a tax-free stock-for-stock
transaction. Del Webb was primarily a homebuilder with operations in seven
states. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, Del Webb reported net income
of $91.2 million on revenues of $1.9 billion and 7,038 unit settlements.
Backlog reported at June 30, 2001, was 3,682 units valued at approximately $994
million. This merger expanded and supported our leadership position. In
particular, we believe the merger strengthened our position among active adult
homebuyers, added important strategic land positions, provided operational
savings from economies of scale, bolstered our purchasing leverage, and
enhanced our overall competitive position. In accordance with our operational
strategy, we will continue to evaluate available strategic acquisition
opportunities that are consistent with our long-range goals.

As of December 31, 2002, our Domestic Homebuilding operations offered
homes for sale in 460 communities at sales prices ranging from $85,000 to
$1,391,000. Sales prices of homes currently offered for sale in 73% of our
communities fall within the range of $150,000 to $450,000 with a 2002 average
unit selling price of $242,000. Sales of single-family detached homes, as a
percentage of total unit sales, were 86% in 2002 and 82% in 2001 and 2000. Our
Domestic Homebuilding operations are geographically diverse to better insulate
us from demand changes in individual markets. As of December 31, 2002, our
Domestic Homebuilding business operated in 44 markets spanning 25 states.

As of December 31, 2002, our Domestic Homebuilding operations had 10,605
units in backlog valued at approximately $2.9 billion.



Homebuilding Operations (continued)

International Homebuilding

Our International Homebuilding operations are primarily conducted through
subsidiaries of International in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Argentina.
International Homebuilding product offerings focus on the demand of first-time
buyers and middle-to-upper income consumer groups. We also have agreements in
place with multi-national corporations to provide employee housing in Mexico.

Mexico

Effective January 1, 2002, International reorganized its structure
within Mexico to create a single company, Pulte Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V.
(Pulte Mexico), which ranks as one of the largest builders in the country.
Prior to the reorganization, these operations were conducted primarily through
five joint ventures throughout Mexico. Under the new ownership structure,
which combines the largest of these entities, we own 63.8% of Pulte Mexico and
have consolidated Pulte Mexico into our financial statements. The new
operating structure facilitates growth, enables operating leverage and improves
efficiencies through standardized systems and procedures.

Puerto Rico

Our operations in Puerto Rico are conducted through
International’s 100%-owned subsidiary, Pulte International Caribbean
Corporation and three joint ventures.

Argentina

Our operations in Argentina, which are based in the greater
Buenos Aires area, are conducted through Pulte SRL, International’s 100%-owned
Argentine subsidiary

.

Land Acquisition and Development

We select locations for development of homebuilding communities after
completing extensive market research, enabling us to match the location and
product offering with our targeted consumer group. We consider factors such as
proximity to developed areas, population and job growth patterns and, if
applicable, estimated development costs. We historically have managed the risk
of controlling our land positions through use of option contracts and outright
acquisition. We typically control land with the intent to complete sales of
housing units within 24 to 36 months from the date of opening a community,
except in the case of certain active-adult developments and our Del Webb
operations for which the completion of community build out requires a longer
time period due to typically larger project sizes. As a result, land is
generally controlled after it is properly zoned and developed or is ready for
development. In addition, we dispose of owned land not required in the
business through sales to appropriate end users. Where we develop land, we
engage directly in many phases of the development process, including land and
site planning, obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals, as well
as constructing roads, sewers, water and drainage facilities, and other
amenities. We use our staff and the services of independent engineers and
consultants for land development activities. Land development work is
performed primarily by independent contractors and local government authorities
which construct sewer and water systems in some areas. At December 31, 2002,
we controlled approximately 176,800 lots, of which 84,300 were owned and 92,500
were under option agreements.

Sales and Marketing

We are dedicated to improving the quality and value of our domestic homes
through innovative proprietary architectural and community designs and
state-of-the-art customer marketing techniques. Analyzing various qualitative
and quantitative data obtained through extensive market research, we segment
our potential customers into well-defined buyer profiles. Once the demands of
potential buyers are understood, we link our home design and community
development efforts to the specific lifestyle of each targeted consumer group.

To meet the demands of our various domestic customers, we have established
a solid design expertise for a wide array of product lines. We believe that we
are an innovator in the design of our homes and we view design capacity as an
integral aspect of our marketing strategy. Our in-house architectural services
teams and management, supplemented by outside consultants, are successful in
creating distinctive design features, both in exterior facades and interior
options and features. In certain markets our strategy is to offer “the
complete house” in which all features shown in the home are included in the
sales price. Standard features typically offered include vaulted ceilings,
appliances, and a variety of available flooring and carpet.



Homebuilding Operations (continued)

Sales and Marketing (continued)

Typically, our domestic sales teams, together with outside sales brokers,
are responsible for guiding the customer through the sales process. We are
committed to industry-leading customer service through a variety of quality
initiatives, including the customer care program, which ensures that homeowners
are comfortable at every stage of the building process. Using a seven-step,
interactive process, homeowners are kept informed during their homebuilding and
home owning experience. The steps include (1) a pre-construction meeting with
the superintendent; (2) pre-dry wall frame walk; (3) quality assurance
inspection; (4) first homeowner orientation; (5) 30-day follow-up after the
close of the home; (6) three-month follow-up; and (7) an 11-month quality list
after the close of the home. Fully furnished and landscaped model homes are
used to showcase our homes and their distinctive design features. We have
great success with the first-time buyer in the low to moderate price range; in
such cases, financing under United States Government-insured and guaranteed
programs is often used and is facilitated through our mortgage company. We
also enjoy strong sales to the move-up buyer and, in certain markets, offer
semi-custom homes in higher price ranges.

In 2002, our Charlotte, Houston, Las Vegas, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Phoenix,
San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California markets were recognized for
ranking the highest in their markets in a national customer satisfaction study.
The survey of sixteen U.S. markets noted customer service and home readiness as
the two factors that most heavily influenced the customer’s overall level of
satisfaction. We finished third or better in twelve of the sixteen markets
surveyed. Building on this quality foundation is our brand development program
with our “Three I’s on Quality” platform. Developing the Pulte Homes brand and
leveraging the strength of the “DiVosta,” “Del Webb” and “Sun City” names not
only distinguishes our communities from the competition, but often earns a
price premium in the marketplace, reduces overall customer acquisition costs
and can result in additional sales.

In addition, our Homeowner for Life™ strategy and philosophy has increased
our business from those who have previously owned a Pulte home or have been
referred by a Pulte homeowner by ensuring a positive home buying and home
owning experience. We introduce our homes to prospective buyers through a
variety of media advertising, illustrated brochures, Internet listings and link
placements, and other advertising displays. In addition, our newly redesigned
website,

www.pulte.com,

provides tools to help users find a home that meets
their needs, investigate financing alternatives, communicate moving plans,
maintain a home, learn more about us and communicate directly with us.
Approximately three million potential customers visited

www.pulte.com

during
2002.

As a result of the Del Webb merger, we are better able to address the
needs of active adults, the fastest growing homebuying segment. With
destination communities offering highly amenitized products such as golf
courses, recreational centers and educational classes, the active adult buyer
has many options to maintain an active lifestyle.

Our international sales and marketing efforts focus on the identification
of regions in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Argentina which are experiencing
population and industrial growth. In Mexico and Puerto Rico, the demand for
affordable and social interest housing is strong. In Mexico, we have several
agreements with large companies in Mexico, including Delphi Automotive Systems
and Centrol Comerciales Soriana, S. A. de C.V., to construct affordable housing
for their employees. In Puerto Rico, the strongest customer demand is for
single-family detached homes, but affordable alternative product offerings also
include two story attached units (townhomes). The market in Argentina offers
low levels of competition and a large residential market in Buenos Aires.

Construction

The construction process for our domestic homes begins with the in-house
design of the homes we sell. The building phase is conducted under the
supervision of our on-site construction superintendents. The construction work
is usually performed by independent contractors under contracts that, in many
instances, cover both labor and materials on a fixed-price basis. We believe
that Pulte Preferred Partnerships (P3), an extension of our quality assurance
program, continues to establish new standards for contractor relations. Using
a selective process, we have teamed up with what we believe are premier
contractors and suppliers to improve all aspects of the land development and
house construction processes.



Homebuilding Operations (continued)

Construction (continued)

We maintain efficient construction operations by using standard materials
and components from a variety of sources and, when possible, by building on
contiguous lots. To minimize the effects of changes in construction costs, the
contracting and purchasing of building supplies and materials generally is
negotiated at or near the time when related sales contracts are signed. In
addition, we utilize the leverage our size affords by actively negotiating our
materials needs on a national or regional basis to minimize production
component cost. We are also working to establish a more integrated system that
can effectively link suppliers, contractors and the production schedule through
various strategic business partnerships and e-business initiatives.

Housing in Mexico and Puerto Rico consists primarily of reinforced poured
concrete, concrete and ceramic block and/or brick construction with flat roofs
and public water, electric and sanitary system connections. Our housing
product in Argentina is designed and constructed in a similar fashion to our
domestic product but is customized for local preferences. Building materials,
supplies and components are sourced locally and the construction work is
performed by general contractors and/or independent contractors, which in many
cases, include both labor and materials.

We cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials will
be available at reasonable prices in the future and have, on occasion,
experienced shortages of skilled labor in certain trades and of building
materials in some markets.

Competition and Other Factors

Our dedication to customer satisfaction is evidenced by our consumer and
value-based brand approach to product development, and is something that we
believe distinguishes us in the homebuilding industry and contributes to our
long-term competitive advantage. The housing industry in the United States,
however, is highly competitive. In each of our market areas, there are
numerous homebuilders with which we compete. Any provider of housing units,
for-sale or to rent, including apartment builders, may be considered a
competitor. Conversion of apartments to condominiums further provides certain
segments of the population an alternative to traditional housing, as does
manufactured housing. We compete primarily on the basis of price, reputation,
design, location and quality of our homes. The housing industry is affected by
a number of economic and other factors including: (1) significant national and
world events, which impact consumer confidence; (2) changes in interest rates;
(3) changes in other costs associated with home ownership, such as property
taxes and energy costs; (4) various demographic factors; (5) changes in federal
income tax laws; and (6) changes in government mortgage financing programs. In
addition to these factors, our business and operations could be affected by
shifts in demand for new homes.

Our operations are subject to building, environmental and other
regulations of various federal, state, local and foreign governing authorities.
For our homes to qualify for Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or Veterans
Administration (VA) mortgages, we must satisfy valuation standards and site,
material and construction requirements of those agencies. Our compliance with
federal, state, local and foreign laws relating to protection of the
environment has had, to date, no material effect upon capital expenditures,
earnings or competitive position. More stringent requirements could be imposed
in the future on homebuilders and developers, thereby increasing the cost of
compliance.

Financial Services Operations

We conduct our financial services business, which includes mortgage and
title operations, through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries.

Mortgage Banking

Our mortgage bank arranges financing through the origination of mortgage
loans primarily for the benefit of our domestic homebuyers, but also services
the general public. We also engage in the sale of such loans and the related
servicing rights. We are a lender approved by the FHA and VA and are a
seller/servicer approved by Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA),
Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation (FHLMC) and other investors. In our conventional mortgage lending
activities, we follow underwriting guidelines established by FNMA and FHLMC.



Financial Services Operations (continued)

Mortgage Banking (continued)

Our mortgage underwriting, processing and closing functions are
centralized in Denver, Colorado using a mortgage operations center (MOC)
concept. We also use a centralized telephone loan officer concept where loan
officers are centrally located at a mortgage application center (MAC) in
Denver. Our sales representatives, who are the mortgage customers’ main
contact, forward the loan applications to a MAC loan counselor who calls the
customer to complete the loan application and then forwards it to the MOC for
processing. We believe both the MOC and the MAC improve the speed and
efficiency of our mortgage operations, thereby improving our profitability and
allowing us to focus on creating attractive mortgage financing opportunities
for our customers.

In originating mortgage loans, we initially use our own funds and
borrowings made available to us through various credit arrangements.
Subsequently, we sell such mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities to
outside investors.

During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, we originated
mortgage loans for approximately 68%, 67% and 56%, respectively, of the homes
we sold. Such originations represented 85%, 81% and 83%, respectively, of our
originations.

We sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing
sales contracts to reduce the risks inherent in servicing loans. This strategy
results in owning the servicing rights for only a short period of time, usually
three to four months after the loan is originated, which substantially reduces
impairment issues with respect to the fair value of these reported assets.

The mortgage industry in the United States is highly competitive. We
compete with other mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide
attractive mortgage financing to both our homebuyers and to the general public.
In originating and servicing mortgage loans, we are subject to rules and
regulations of the FHA, VA, GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC. The Internet is also an
important resource for homebuyers in obtaining financing as a number of
companies provide online approval for their customers. These Internet-based
mortgage companies may also be considered competitors.

Discontinued Operations

During the first quarter of 1994, we adopted a plan of disposal for First
Heights and announced our strategy to exit the thrift industry and increase our
focus on housing and related mortgage banking. First Heights sold all but one
of its 32 bank branches and related deposits to two unrelated purchasers. The
sale was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 1994.

Although in 1994, we expected to complete the plan of disposal within a
reasonable period of time, contractual disputes with the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) prevented the prepayment of the Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corporation Resolution Fund (FRF) notes, thereby precluding
us from completing the disposal in accordance with our original plan. To
provide liquidity for the sale, First Heights liquidated its investment
portfolios and its single-family residential loan portfolio and, as provided in
the Assistance Agreement, entered into a Liquidity Assistance Note (LAN) with
the FDIC acting in its capacity as manager of the FRF notes. The LAN was
collateralized by the FRF notes. The LAN and FRF notes matured in September
1998; however, payment of these obligations was withheld by both parties
pending resolution of all open matters with the FDIC. As discussed in Note 11
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we settled the litigation with
the FDIC in October 2001, and as part of that settlement all obligations under
the LAN and FRF notes were extinguished.

First Heights’ day-to-day activities are principally devoted to supporting
residual regulatory compliance matters and the litigation with the United
States government and are not reflective of the active operations of the former
thrift, such as maintaining traditional transaction accounts (e.g., checking
and savings accounts) or making loans. Accordingly, such operations are
presented as discontinued.



Corporate

Corporate is a non-operating segment that is comprised primarily of Pulte
and PDCI, both of which are holding companies. The primary purpose of
Corporate is to support the operations of our subsidiaries as the internal
source of financing, and to develop and implement strategic initiatives
centered around new business development and operating efficiencies. Business
development activities include the pursuit of additional domestic and
international opportunities as well as the development of innovative building
components and processes. Corporate also includes the activities associated
with supporting a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock
Exchange.

Corporate assets include equity investments in its subsidiaries,
short-term financial instruments and affiliate advances. Liabilities include
senior and subordinated debt and income taxes. Corporate revenues consist
primarily of investment earnings of excess funds, while its expenses include
costs associated with supporting a publicly traded company and its
subsidiaries’ operations, and investigating strategic initiatives.

Organization/Employees

All subsidiaries and operating units operate independently with respect to
daily operations. Homebuilding real estate purchases and other significant
homebuilding, mortgage banking, financing activities and similar operating
decisions must be approved by the business unit and/or corporate senior
management.

At December 31, 2002, we employed approximately 9,200 persons. Our
employees are not represented by any union. Contracted work, however, may be
performed by union contractors. Homebuilding and mortgage banking management
personnel are paid performance bonuses and incentive compensation. Performance
bonuses are based on individual performance while incentive compensation is
based on the performance of the applicable business unit or subsidiary. Our
corporate management personnel are paid incentive compensation based on overall
performance of the Company (see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements). Each subsidiary is given autonomy regarding employment of
personnel, although our senior corporate management acts in an advisory
capacity in the employment of subsidiary officers. We consider our employee
and contractor relations to be satisfactory.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Our homebuilding and corporate headquarters are located at 100 Bloomfield
Hills Parkway, Suite 300, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan 48304, where we lease
63,740 square feet of office space. We also lease 81,167 square feet of office
space at 6001 North 24th Street, Phoenix, Arizona 85016 for certain corporate
and business services. Pulte Mortgage’s offices are located at 7475 South
Joliet Street, Englewood, Colorado 80112 and 99 Inverness Drive East,
Englewood, Colorado 80112. We lease approximately 61,436 square feet and
18,000 square feet, respectively, of office space at these locations. Our
homebuilding markets and mortgage branch operations generally lease office
space for their day-to-day operations. First Heights’ administrative office is
located in 918 square feet of leased space at 2010 North Loop West, Suite 220,
Houston, Texas 77018.

Because of the nature of our homebuilding operations, significant amounts
of property are held as inventory in the ordinary course of our homebuilding
business. Such properties are not included in response to this Item.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are involved in various litigation incidental to our continuing
business operations. We believe that none of this litigation will have a
material adverse impact on our results of operations, our financial position or
our cash flows.

First Heights-related litigation

We were a party to three lawsuits relating to First Heights’ 1988
acquisition from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) and
First Heights’ ownership of five failed Texas thrifts. The first lawsuit (the
“District Court Case”) was filed on July 7, 1995, in the United States District
Court, Eastern District of Michigan, by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) against Pulte, PDCI and First Heights (collectively, the
“Pulte Parties”). The second lawsuit (the “Court of Federal Claims Case”) was
filed on December 26, 1996, in the United States Court of Federal Claims
(Washington, D.C.) by the Pulte Parties against the United States. The third
lawsuit was filed by First Heights on January 10, 2000, in the United States
District Court, Eastern District of Michigan against the FDIC regarding the
amounts, including interest, the FDIC was obligated to pay First Heights on two
promissory notes which had been executed by the FDIC’s predecessor, the FSLIC.



ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (continued)

First Heights-related litigation (continued)

In the District Court Case, the FDIC, as successor to the FSLIC, sought a
declaration of rights and other relief related to the Assistance Agreement
entered into between First Heights and the FSLIC. The FDIC and the Pulte
Parties disagreed about the proper interpretation of provisions in the
Assistance Agreement which provide for sharing of certain tax benefits achieved
in connection with First Heights’ 1988 acquisition and ownership of the five
failed Texas thrifts. The District Court Case also included certain other
claims relating to the foregoing, including claims resulting from the Company’s
and First Heights’ amendment of a tax sharing and allocation agreement between
the Company and First Heights. The Pulte Parties disputed the FDIC’s claims
and filed an answer and a counterclaim, seeking, among other things, a
declaration that the FDIC had breached the Assistance Agreement in numerous
respects. On December 24, 1996, the Pulte Parties voluntarily dismissed
without prejudice certain of their claims in the District Court Case and, on
December 26, 1996, initiated the Court of Federal Claims Case.

In October 2001, the FDIC and the Pulte Parties settled the District Court
Case, the related appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and the third
lawsuit. As part of this settlement (the “Settlement”), the First Heights
Assistance Agreement was terminated, except that certain tax benefit sharing
provisions will continue in effect, and the warrants issued by First Heights to
the FDIC were extinguished. We do not believe that the claims in the Court of
Federal Claims Case are in any way prejudiced by the Settlement.

In the Court of Federal Claims Case, the Pulte Parties assert breaches of
contract on the part of the United States in connection with the enactment of
Section 13224 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (“OBRA”). That
provision repealed portions of the tax benefits that the Pulte Parties claim
they were entitled to under the contract to acquire the failed Texas thrifts.
The Pulte Parties also assert another claim concerning the contract, that the
United States (through the FDIC as receiver) improperly attempted to amend the
failed thrifts’ pre-acquisition tax returns and that this attempt was made in
an effort to deprive the Pulte Parties of tax benefits for which they had
contracted.

On August 17, 2001, the United States Court of Federal Claims ruled that
the United States government is liable to the Company for breach of contract by
enacting Section 13224 of OBRA. The Court is proceeding to determine the
amount of damages to which the Pulte Parties are entitled. While it is unclear
at this time what amount the Court will award, the Pulte Parties are currently
seeking approximately $80 million in after tax damages for the United States
government’s breach of contract.

A comparison of pre-tax income (loss), for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 is as follows:

•

Continued strong demand for new housing, the addition and expansion
of the Del Webb operations, coupled with our ability to effectively
manage selling pace and price drove pre-tax income of our homebuilding
business segment to increase 41% in 2002 and 33% in 2001. Domestic
average unit selling price increased by 8% in 2002 and 9% in 2001.
Additionally, domestic gross margin percentages were up 30 basis points
in 2002 principally as a result of purchase accounting adjustments
recorded in 2001. Compared to 2000, our 2001 domestic gross margins
increased 110 basis points as a result of several factors including an
increase in the average selling price and leveraged purchasing
initiatives partially offset by purchase accounting adjustments.

•

Pre-tax income of our financial services business segment increased
81% in 2002 and 49% in 2001 as a result of increased volume, a favorable
interest rate environment, effective leverage of overhead costs and the
addition and expansion of Del Webb mortgage operations.

•

Pre-tax loss of our corporate business segment increased 8% in 2002
to $62.0 million principally from higher interest costs, related to an
increase in debt levels to support the growth of the business. In 2001,
our pre-tax loss increased $1.2 million to $57.5 million as the increase
in net interest expense was partially offset by lower Corporate
expenditures.

During the third quarter of 2002, we recorded an after-tax gain of
approximately $10 million in discontinued operations. The gain related to the
recognition of income tax benefits resulting from the favorable resolution of
certain tax matters associated with the thrift operations we discontinued in
1994.



ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Homebuilding:

Our Homebuilding segment consists of the following operations:

•

We conduct our Domestic Homebuilding operations in 44 markets,
located throughout 25 states. Domestic Homebuilding offers a broad
product line to meet the needs of the first-time, first and second
move-up, and active adult homebuyers.

•

We conduct our International Homebuilding operations through
subsidiaries of Pulte International Corporation (International) in
Mexico, Puerto Rico and Argentina. International Homebuilding product
offerings focus on the demand of first-time buyers and middle-to-upper
income consumer groups. We also have agreements in place with
multi-national corporations to provide employee housing in Mexico.

Certain operating data relating to our homebuilding operations and
Pulte-affiliated joint ventures are as follows ($000’s omitted):



ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Homebuilding (continued):

Domestic Homebuilding:

The Domestic Homebuilding operations represent our core business. We
conduct our operations in 44 markets, located throughout 25 states, and are
presented geographically as follows:

Northeast:

Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York,

Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia

Southeast:

Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee

Midwest:

Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio

Central:

Colorado, Texas

West:

Arizona, California, Nevada

The greater Phoenix market accounted for 10% of Domestic Homebuilding
settlement revenues, 11% of settlement units and 11% of net new orders in
2002. The metropolitan Atlanta market accounted for 10% of unit settlements in
2000. No other individual market represented more than 10% of total Domestic
Homebuilding settlement revenues, settlement units or net new orders during the
three years ended December 31, 2002.

The following table presents selected unit information for our Domestic
Homebuilding operations:



ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Homebuilding (continued):

Domestic Homebuilding (continued):

Unit settlements in 2002 reached a record high, increasing 26% to 28,903
units. A full year of the Del Webb operations combined with strong sales in
the Midwest drove the increase. 2001 unit settlements increased 16% to 22,915
units, principally from the addition of the Del Webb operations. The average
selling price for our homes increased from $206,000 in 2000 to $225,000 in 2001
and to $242,000 in the current year. Changes in average selling price reflect
a number of factors, including price increases, the mix of product closed
during a period and the number of options purchased by customers. Both 2002
and 2001 benefited from increased product prices, improved product mix and the
inclusion of Del Webb product offerings, which had an average selling price
higher than our traditional offerings.

Ending backlog, which represents orders for homes that have not yet
closed, climbed 22% to 10,605 homes. The dollar value of our ending backlog
was up 35% to $2.9 billion at December 31, 2002. Unit and dollar backlog at
December 31, 2001, increased 58% and 62%, respectively, to 8,678 homes valued
at $2.1 billion. Overall, strong demand supported by a favorable interest rate
environment and the addition of Del Webb operations drove increased order
activity and record levels of backlog.

We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge
the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that
approximates the average life cycle of our communities.

Gross profit margins from home sales in 2002 increased 30 basis points
over 2001 to 20.1%, including the effect of purchase accounting associated with
the Del Webb merger. Excluding the effect of purchase accounting adjustments
in both years, gross margins would have been 20.1% in 2002 and 20.0% in 2001.
Gross profit margins in 2001 increased 110 basis points to 19.8% including
purchase accounting adjustments and 130 basis points excluding purchase
accounting adjustments over 2000 gross margins. Factors that contributed to
this favorable trend include strong customer demand, positive home pricing, the
benefits of leverage-buy purchasing activities and effective production and
inventory management.

Land sales increased in each of the prior three years, demonstrating our
competency in purchasing, developing and entitling certain land positions for
sale primarily to other homebuilders, as well as to retail and commercial
establishments. Revenues and their related gains/losses may vary significantly
between periods, depending on the timing of such sales. We continue to
rationalize certain existing land positions to ensure the most effective use of
invested capital.

For the year ended December 31, 2002, selling, general and administrative
expenses, as a percentage of home settlement revenues, increased 13 basis
points to 9.50% after increasing 42 basis points to 9.37% in 2001. Higher
startup costs for new communities and increased compensation related costs
partially offset by a reduction in costs associated with the Del Webb
operations contributed to the change in 2002. The increase in 2001 reflects
higher startup costs for new communities, increased compensation related costs,
local market advertising expenses and the inclusion of Del Webb operations.



ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Homebuilding (continued):

Domestic Homebuilding (continued):

Interest expense increased $12.7 million to $48.7 million in 2002 and $8.0
million to $36.0 million in 2001. The increases are a result of an increase in
debt levels necessary to support the growth of the business.

Other expense, net increased to $23.0 million in 2002 primarily as a
result of income from certain non-operating investments recorded in 2001. The
increase from 2000 to 2001 represents an increase in land inventory valuation
reserves for certain land positions and amortization of tradenames and
trademarks acquired in the merger with Del Webb.

At December 31, 2002 and 2001, our Domestic Homebuilding operations
controlled approximately 176,800 and 141,100 lots, respectively. Approximately
84,300 and 81,200 lots were owned, and approximately 43,800 and 34,800 lots
under option agreements approved for purchase at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. In addition, there were approximately 48,700 lots under option
agreements at December 31, 2002, pending approval, that are under review and
evaluation for future use by our Domestic Homebuilding operations. This
compared to 25,100 lots at December 31, 2001.

Domestic Homebuilding inventory at December 31, 2002, was approximately
$4.1 billion, of which $3.2 billion related to land and land development. At
December 31, 2001, inventory was approximately $3.8 billion, of which $2.8
billion related to land and land development. Included in other assets is
approximately $218.8 million in land held for disposition as of December 31,
2002, as compared to $223.5 million in the prior year.

International Homebuilding:

Our International Homebuilding operations are primarily conducted through
subsidiaries of International in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Argentina.

Mexico

Effective January 1, 2002, International reorganized its structure
within Mexico to create a single company, Pulte Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V.
(Pulte Mexico), which ranks as one of the largest builders in the country.
Prior to the reorganization, these operations were conducted primarily through
five joint ventures throughout Mexico. Under the new ownership structure,
which combines the largest of these entities, we own 63.8% of Pulte Mexico and
have consolidated Pulte Mexico into our financial statements. The new
operating structure facilitates growth, enables operating leverage and improves
efficiencies through standardized systems and procedures.

Puerto Rico

Operations in Puerto Rico are conducted through
International’s 100%-owned subsidiary, Pulte International Caribbean
Corporation and three joint ventures.

Argentina

Operations in Argentina, which are based in the greater Buenos
Aires area, are conducted through Pulte SRL, International’s 100%-owned
Argentine subsidiary.



ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Homebuilding (continued):

International Homebuilding (continued):

The following table presents selected financial data for our International
Homebuilding operations for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000
($000’s omitted):

Unit settlements for Pulte and Pulte-affiliated entities in 2002 were
relatively flat as compared to 2001 and down in 2001 when compared to 2000, as
declines in Puerto Rico and Mexico were only partially offset by settlements in
Argentina, which approached 200 in 2002. Settlements in Mexico were 7,166 in
2002 compared to 7,158 in 2001 and 7,718 in 2000. Activity in Mexico continues
to be slowed by the impact of changes made in 2001 and 2002 to local lending
practices and the lack of alternative funding sources.

Increased revenues in 2002 are due to consolidation of the operations in
Mexico for eleven months of 2002, a full year of operations in Argentina, which
had only begun recognizing its first closings in June of 2001, partially offset
by a decline in Puerto Rico. Revenues from our operations in Mexico were
$158.1 million in 2002. Our operations in Argentina contributed $25.9 million
compared to $9.5 million in the prior year. Revenues in Puerto Rico were down
to $12.1 million from $25.5 million.

The consolidation of Mexico also had a positive effect on gross margins,
which rose to 19.9% in 2002 from 12.0% in 2001 and 9.4% in 2000. Selling,
general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues declined as a
result of a reduction in start-up costs associated with our operations in
Argentina. Equity in income of joint ventures in 2002 represents one month of
the joint venture operations in Mexico and our joint venture located in
Canovanas, Puerto Rico, which had its first closings during the third quarter
of 2001.

Our operations in Argentina recorded transaction losses of $208,000 and
$463,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, as the
value of the Argentine peso continued to fluctuate following the Argentine
government’s decision to de-link its valuation from the U.S. Dollar. We also
recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $12.8 million, as a component
of cumulative other comprehensive income during 2002. It remains unclear at
this time how the financial and currency markets in Argentina will be impacted
in 2003 or how the current economic situation may affect customer home buying
attitudes and the homebuilding business in general. At December 31, 2002, our
investment, net of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments, in
Argentina approximated $13.1 million. Our operations in Mexico have also been
affected by a strengthening dollar to the Mexican peso where transaction losses
of $483,000, $378,000 and $78,000 were recorded in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. At December 31, 2002, our investment, net of cumulative foreign
currency translation adjustments, in Mexico approximated $61.1 million.



ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Financial Services:

We conduct our financial services business, which includes mortgage and
title operations, through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries.

We sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing
sales contracts. Due to the short period of time the servicing rights are
held, usually three to four months, we do not amortize the servicing asset.
Since the servicing rights are recorded at the value in the servicing sales
contracts, there are no impairment issues related to these assets. We also
originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available
through various credit arrangements, and then sell such mortgage loans to
outside investors.

The following table presents mortgage origination data for our Financial
Services operations:

Mortgage origination unit and principal volume for the year ended December
31, 2002, increased 21% and 28%, respectively, over 2001. This growth can be
attributed to an increase in the capture rate of 390 basis points to 77.6% and
the inclusion of Del Webb mortgage operations for a full year. Our capture
rate represents loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percent
of total loan opportunities, excluding cash settlements, from our homebuilding
business. Mortgage origination principal volume in 2001 increased 50% over
2000, due to an increase in the capture rate of 950 basis points to 73.7%, an
increased average loan size and the inclusion of Del Webb mortgage operations,
which accounted for approximately 13% of the increase. Origination unit volume
increased 42% due to the same factors. Our home buying customers continue to
account for the majority of total loan production, representing 85% of total
Pulte Mortgage unit production for 2002, compared with 81% in 2001 and 83% in
2000. Refinancings represented 8% of total loan production in 2002, compared
with 10% in 2001 and 2% during 2000. At December 31, 2002, loan application
backlog increased 66% to $1.4 billion as compared to $827 million and $536
million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2002, increased 81% to
$66.7 million, as a result of increased volume, a favorable interest rate
environment, effective leverage of overhead costs and the inclusion of Del Webb
mortgage operations for a full year. Gains from the sale of mortgages
increased $20.4 million, or 49%, from the same period in 2001. As compared
with 2001, net interest income increased $6.3 million to $11.3 million during
2002 due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the
drop in interest rates during 2002. Title income grew 42% contributing $12.2
million to pre-tax income for the year.

Pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased 49% to
$36.9 million, due to increases in volume, capture rate and secondary marketing
gains. The addition of Del Webb mortgage operations for the last five months
of 2001 contributed approximately 8% of this increase. Pricing and marketing
gains increased $17.4 million, or 71%, from the same period in 2000, primarily
due to a consistent drop in interest rates throughout 2001. As compared with
2000, net interest income increased $3.1 million to $5.0 million during 2001
due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the drop
in interest rates during 2001. Offsetting these gains was an increase in SG&A
expenses of $10 million as a result of increased headcount and other related
costs due to the increase in volume during 2001. Income from our title
operations increased 48% to $8.6 million in 2001, further fueling the growth in
our financial services business.



ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Financial Services (continued):

We hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed
mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments. For the year ended
December 31, 2002, we did not recognize any net gains or losses related to the
ineffective portion of the hedging instrument excluded from the assessment of
hedge effectiveness. We also did not recognize any gains or losses during
2002, for cash flow hedges that were discontinued because it is probable that
the original forecasted transaction will not occur. At December 31, 2002, we
expect to reclassify $1.3 million, net of taxes, of net losses on derivative
instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the
next twelve months from sales of closed mortgage loans.

Corporate:

Corporate is a non-operating business segment whose primary purpose is to
support the operations of our subsidiaries as the internal source of financing,
to develop and implement strategic initiatives centered on new business
development and operating efficiencies, and to provide the administrative
support associated with being a publicly traded entity. As a result, the
corporate segment’s operating results will vary from year to year as these
strategic initiatives evolve.

The following table presents this segment’s results of operations ($000’s

Interest expense, net of interest capitalized into inventory, increased
12% to $38.2 million in 2002 and 18% to $34.3 million in 2001. This trend is a
result of an increase in debt levels necessary to support our growth. Interest
incurred for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, excluding
interest incurred by our financial services operations, was approximately
$162.5, $116.9 and $62.8 million, respectively.

Other corporate expense, net over the two-year period ended December 31,
2002, was relatively flat, as higher compensation related costs were offset by
income from the sale and adjustment to fair value of various non-operating
parcels of commercial land held for sale. The decrease in other corporate
expenses, net in 2001 when compared to 2000 is primarily due to the write-down
of commercial land held for sale in 2000.

Interest capitalized into inventory is charged to homebuilding interest
expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our
communities. Interest in inventory at December 31, 2002, increased primarily
as a result of higher levels of indebtedness and the addition of the Del Webb
properties, which have a longer life cycle. Information related to Corporate

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Liquidity and Capital Resources:

Our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December
31, 2002, amounted to $162.2 million. The increase in net income was aided by
the realization of certain tax benefits and an increase in accrued liabilities,
while inventories continued to build to support the growth of the business.
Net cash provided by investing activities was $4.6 million for 2002. Net cash
provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, was
$374.2 million, reflecting proceeds from the $300 million senior notes issued
in June 2002, proceeds from borrowings under our various credit facilities and
proceeds from employee stock option exercises, offset by the repayment of debt,
dividends paid and stock repurchases.

Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31,
2001, was $418.8 million as higher net income was offset by increases in
inventory and residential mortgage loans available-for-sale over 2000 and the
resolution of the First Heights litigation. Net cash provided by investing
activities in 2001 increased primarily due to the net cash acquired from Del
Webb. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $297.1 million as
proceeds from the issuance of senior notes of $200 million and $500 million,
and increased borrowings under the revolving credit arrangements were offset by
the repayment of higher-rate debt acquired from Del Webb.

We finance our homebuilding land acquisitions, development and
construction activities from internally generated funds and existing credit
agreements. We had no borrowings under our $570 million unsecured revolving
credit facility at December 31, 2002.

Pulte Mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and
uses its own funds and borrowings made available pursuant to various committed
and uncommitted credit arrangements totaling $600 million, an amount deemed
adequate to cover foreseeable needs. There were approximately $560 million of
borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2002 under the $600 million Pulte
Mortgage arrangements. Mortgage loans originated by Pulte Mortgage are
subsequently sold to outside investors. We anticipate that there will be
adequate mortgage financing available for purchasers of our homes.

In June 2002, we sold $300 million of 7.875% senior notes, due 2032, from
our $1 billion shelf registration. Cash provided by operations, combined with
the net proceeds from this sale of senior notes, were used to call, redeem and
repurchase approximately $103 million of Del Webb senior subordinated notes and
to repay short-term borrowings under our revolving bank credit arrangements.

In October 2002, our operating entity in Argentina entered into a $3
million revolving credit facility in order to provide an additional financial
resource to support the operations. Pulte Homes, Inc has guaranteed the credit
facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December
31, 2002.

In October 2002, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a stock
repurchase plan of up to $100 million. Shares will be purchased from
time-to-time on the open market, depending on market conditions. During the
year ended December 31, 2002, we repurchased 100,000 shares for approximately
$4.3 million.

Our income tax liabilities are affected by a number of factors. In 2002,
our effective tax rate was 39.0% compared to 38.5% in 2001 and 2000. We
anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2003 will be approximately 39.0%.

Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are used to guarantee our
performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the
development of our projects. The expiration dates of the letter of credit
contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related project.
If the obligations related to the project are ongoing, annual extensions are
granted on a year-to-year basis. Performance bonds do not have stated
expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual
performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $954 million at
December 31, 2002, are typically outstanding over a period that approximates
3-5 years.

In the normal course of business, we acquire rights under options or
option-type agreements to purchase land to be used in homebuilding operations
at future dates. These rights, which may be cancelled at our discretion, may
extend over several years and are typically secured by small deposits.
Further, these rights are frequently extended or renegotiated to better match
the needs of our homebuilding operations. The total purchase price applicable
to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future
dates approximated $1.5 billion at December 31, 2002, which represented
approximately 43,800 lots. In addition, there were approximately 48,700 lots
valued at $982 million under option at December 31, 2002 pending approval, that
are under review and evaluation for future use by our homebuilding operations.

Sources of our working capital at December 31, 2002, include cash and
equivalents, our $570 million committed unsecured revolving credit facility and
Pulte Mortgage’s $600 million revolving credit. Our debt-to-total
capitalization, excluding our collateralized debt, was approximately 41% as of
December 31, 2002, and approximately 32% net of cash and equivalents. We
expect to maintain our net debt-to-total capitalization at or below the 40%
level.



ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued):

In February 2003, we sold $300 million of 6.25% senior notes, due 2013,
from the Company’s current shelf registration. Proceeds from the sale will be
used to retire certain debt coming due or called in 2003. Subsequent to this
issuance, we had $400 million remaining available under the current mixed
securities shelf registration.

Inflation:

We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected
during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs.
Inflation also increases our financing, labor and material costs. In
addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability
of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass
to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. To
date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of
operations. However, there is no assurance that inflation will not have a
material adverse impact on our future results of operations.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates:

The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is
generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in
our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make
estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result,
actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial
statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and
disclosures included in the financial statements, giving due regard to
materiality. The development and selection of the following critical
accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee
of the Board of Directors.

Revenue recognition:

Homebuilding — Homebuilding revenues are recorded when the sales of homes
are completed and ownership has transferred to the customer. Unfunded
settlements are deposits in transit on homes for which the sale was completed.
We do not engage in arrangements whereby we have ongoing relationships with our
homebuyers that require us to repurchase our homes or provide homebuyers with
the right of return.

Financial Services — Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for
servicing loans for various investors. Servicing fees are based on a
contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance and are credited to
income when the related mortgage payments are received. Loan origination fees,
commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred as an
adjustment to the cost of the related mortgage loan until such loan is sold.
Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are
sold.

Inventory valuation:

Our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated cost or
net realizable value. Included in inventories are all direct development
costs. We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge
the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates
the average life cycle of our communities. This period increased in 2001 due
to the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle.
Inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated
cost, unless they are determined to be impaired, in which case these
inventories are measured at fair value. If actual market conditions are less
favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments
may be required.

Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis. Under the
specific identification basis, cost of sales includes the construction cost of
the home, an average lot cost by project based on land acquisition and
development costs, and closing costs and commissions. Construction cost of the
home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home, plus an
accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted
construction cost. This accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual
payments made after closing compared to the amount accrued, and adjustments are
made if needed. Total project land acquisition and development costs are based
on an analysis of budgeted costs compared to actual costs incurred to date and
estimates to complete. Adjustments to estimated total project land acquisition
and development costs for the project affect the amount of future lots costed.



ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued):

Residential mortgage loans available-for-sale:

Residential mortgage loans available-for-sale are stated at the lower of
aggregate cost or market value. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans
are recognized when the loans are sold. We hedge our residential mortgage
loans available-for-sale. Gains and losses from closed commitments and futures
contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on the sale of
mortgage loans.

Goodwill and intangible assets:

We have identified significant intangible assets and generated significant
goodwill, most recently as a result of the Del Webb merger in 2001. Intangible
assets, primarily trademarks and tradenames, were valued by independent
appraisers and advisors using proven valuation procedures and are amortized
over their estimated useful life. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment
testing. The carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is
dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to
generate from their use. If our expectations of future results and cash flows
decrease significantly, intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired and the
resulting charge to operations may be material. If we determine that the
carrying value of intangible assets, long-lived assets and goodwill may not be
recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment,
we measure impairment based on one of two methods. For assets related to
ongoing operations we plan to continue, we use a projected undiscounted cash
flow method to determine if impairment exists and then measure impairment using
discounted cash flows. For assets to be disposed of, we assess the fair value
of the asset based on current market conditions for similar assets. For
goodwill, we assess fair value by measuring discounted cash flows of our
reporting units and measure impairment as the difference between the resulting
implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value.

The estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make
significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors
outside of our control. Changes in these estimates could result in significant
revisions to the carrying value of these assets and material charges to the
results of operations.

Investments in unconsolidated entities:

We participate in a number of joint ventures with independent third
parties in which we have less than a controlling interest. These joint
ventures purchase, develop and/or sell land and homes in the United States,
Mexico and Puerto Rico. We recognize our share of profits from the sale of
lots and homes to other buyers. We do not recognize profits from lots we
purchase, but instead defer those profits until the related homes are sold. At
December 31, 2002, we had approximately $49.0 million invested in these joint
ventures. Under certain arrangements, future capital contributions may be
necessary to maintain our ownership in the joint venture. We have not
guaranteed any of the outstanding debt of the joint ventures at December 31,
2002, which approximated $103.2 million.

We also own 22.2% of the capital stock of a mortgage banking company in
Mexico. At December 31, 2002, our investment in this entity was approximately
$15.8 million. We do not have any purchase or investment commitments to this
entity. Furthermore, we have not guaranteed any of the indebtedness of this
entity, which approximated $1.2 billion at December 31, 2002.

These investments are accounted for on the equity method.

Allowance for warranties:

Home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building
defects. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary
geographically. Most warranties cover different aspects of the home’s
construction and operating systems for a period of up to ten years. We
estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability
in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors
that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold, historical
and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. We periodically
assesses the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts
as necessary. Although we have not made significant adjustments to the accrual
in the past, actual warranty cost in the future could differ from our current
estimate.

Pulte Mortgage, operating as a mortgage banker, is also subject to
interest rate risk. Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to
a customer at agreed-upon terms (i.e., commit to lend at a certain interest
rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through
the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2002 and
2001, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In
periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally
increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to
letting the interest rate float.

We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable
rate borrowing agreement tied to the Federal Funds rate and (ii) hedging our
loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments with
off-balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include cash forward
placement contracts on mortgage-backed securities, whole loan investor
commitments, options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward
placement contracts on mortgage-backed securities. We do not use any
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments
arising from immediate parallel shifts in long-term mortgage rates of plus 50,
100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results.

Our aggregate net investments exposed to foreign currency exchange rate
risk include our operations in Mexico which approximated $61.1 million, our
mortgage banking joint venture investment in Mexico which approximated $15.8
million and our operations in Argentina which approximated $13.1 million.

Goodwill (continued)

The following table sets forth reported net income and earnings per
share, as adjusted to exclude goodwill amortization expense ($000,s omitted,
except per share data):

The majority of goodwill, which represents the cost of acquired
companies in excess of the fair value of the net assets at the acquisition
date, resulted from the acquisition of Del Webb in 2001 and has been included
in the homebuilding segment. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, annually and
when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not
be recoverable, management evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by
comparing the carrying value of the Company’s reporting units to their fair
value. Fair value is determined based on discounted future cash flows. The
Company performed its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter 2002
and determined there to be no impairment of goodwill. Consequently, there
was no change in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended December
31, 2002.

Intangible assets

Intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks and tradenames
acquired in connection with the 2001 acquisition of Del Webb. These
intangible assets were valued by independent appraisers and advisors at the
acquisition date utilizing proven valuation procedures and are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over a 20-year life. The acquired cost
and accumulated amortization of the Company’s intangible assets is $163.5
million and $11.5 million, respectively. Amortization expense for the year
ended December 31, 2002 was $8.2 million and is expected to be approximately
$8.3 million in each of the next 5 years.

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, intangible assets are reviewed for
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying
amounts may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators exist, an
assessment of undiscounted future cash flows for the assets related to these
intangibles is evaluated accordingly. If the results of the analysis
indicate impairment, the assets are adjusted to fair market value.

Segment information

The Company’s operations are classified into three reportable segments:
Homebuilding, Financial Services and Corporate.

The Company’s Homebuilding segment consists of the following operations:

•

Domestic Homebuilding, the Company’s core business, is engaged in the
acquisition and development of land primarily for residential purposes
within the continental United States and the construction of housing on
such land targeted for the first-time, first and second move-up, and
active adult home buyers.

•

International Homebuilding is primarily engaged in the acquisition
and development of land principally for residential purposes, and the
construction of housing on such land in Mexico, Puerto Rico and
Argentina.

The Company’s Financial Services segment consists principally of
mortgage banking and title operations conducted through Pulte Mortgage and
other Company subsidiaries.

Corporate is a non-operating business segment which supports the
operations of the Company’s subsidiaries by acting as the internal source of
financing, developing and implementing strategic initiatives centered on new
business development and operating efficiencies, and providing the necessary
administrative functions to support the Company as a publicly traded entity

Del Webb merger

On July 31, 2001, the Company merged with Del Webb Corporation in a
tax-free stock-for-stock transaction. Under the terms of the merger
agreement, each outstanding share of Del Webb common stock was exchanged for
approximately 0.894 shares of newly issued Company stock. Approximately 16.8
million shares were issued to Del Webb shareholders. Del Webb was primarily
a homebuilder with operations in seven states. For the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2001, Del Webb reported net income of $91.2 million on revenues of
$1.9 billion and 7,038 unit settlements. Backlog reported at June 30, 2001
was 3,682 units valued at approximately $994 million.

This merger expanded and supported the Company’s leadership position. In
particular, the Company believes the merger strengthened its position among
active adult homebuyers, added important strategic land positions, provided
operational savings from economies of scale, bolstered our purchasing
leverage, and enhanced the Company’s overall competitive position.

The merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
Approximately 16.8 million shares were issued and assigned an approximate
accounting value of $42.74 per share based on the average closing price of
the Company’s stock for the five trading days ended July 26, 2001. The
components of the purchase price and allocation are as follows ($000’s
omitted):

This goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes, was allocated
solely to the Homebuilding segment. Trademarks and tradenames are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of 20 years. Independent
appraisers and advisors utilizing proven valuation procedures allocated
portions of the purchase price, including inventory, intangible assets and
various other assets.

Del Webb operations have been included in the consolidated results since
August 1, 2001. The following table presents a summary of the unaudited pro
forma operating results for the Company assuming that the merger with Del
Webb occurred on January 1, 2001 and 2000.

As of December 31, 2002, 2,502,657 stock options remain available for
grant under the Employee Plans and 170,000 stock options remain available for
grant under the Director Plan.

The Employee Plans primarily provide for the grant of options (both
non-qualified options and incentive stock options as defined in each
respective plan), stock appreciation rights and restricted stock to key
employees of the Company or its subsidiaries (as determined by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors) for periods not exceeding
ten years. Options granted under the Employee Plans vest incrementally in
periods ranging from six months to five years. Under the Director Plan,
nonemployee directors are entitled to an annual distribution of 900 shares of
common stock and options to purchase an additional 4,000 shares. All options
granted are non-qualified, vest immediately and are exercisable on the date
of grant. Options granted under the Director Plan are exercisable for ten
years from the grant date.

As a result of the Del Webb merger, the Company assumed Del Webb
employee stock plans and their director stock plans. No stock options remain
available for grant under the Del Webb plans.

Exclusive of the Employee Plans and Director Plan above, the Company
awarded 241,241 and 157,961 shares of restricted stock to certain key
employees during 2002 and 2001, respectively. In connection with the
restricted stock awards, which cliff vest at the end of three years, the
Company recorded compensation expense of $5.3 million and $1.7 million during
2002 and 2001, respectively. In addition, the Company’s nonemployee
directors can elect to defer, for a maximum of eight years, certain amounts
of the consideration they receive for their service as directors. The cash
deferred may be tied to either Company stock or certain stock indices. At
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 there were 19,300, 20,000 and 18,800 phantom
stock units outstanding, respectively.

Income taxes

The Company’s net deferred tax asset is as follows ($000’s omitted):

The state net operating losses of $55.6 million expire in years 2006
through 2022 and are generally available to offset the Company’s taxable
income in future years. State and other credit carryforwards include a
credit voucher of $10.8 million that is expected to be realized by the
Company no later than 2006. Realization of the net deferred tax asset is
dependent on future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and
adequate future taxable income. Although realization is not assured,
management believes that, except for the valuation allowance stated, it is
more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized.

Components of current and deferred income tax expense (benefit) of
continuing operations are as follows ($000’s omitted):

Leases

The Company leases certain property and equipment under non-cancelable
leases. Office and equipment leases are generally for terms of three to five
years and generally provide renewal options for terms of up to an additional
three years. Model home leases are generally for shorter terms approximating
one year with renewal options on a month-to-month basis. In most cases,
management expects that in the normal course of business, leases that expire
will be renewed or replaced by other leases. The future minimum lease
payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining
non-cancelable terms in excess of one year are as follows ($000’s omitted):

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

The management of Pulte Homes, Inc. is responsible for the integrity and
objectivity of the accompanying financial statements and related information.
The statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States, and, as such, include amounts that are based on
our best judgments and estimates.

Management maintains a system of internal accounting and disclosure controls
designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that
transactions and events are recorded properly and that ultimately will result
in the preparation of reliable financial statements. While the Company is
organized on the principle of decentralized management, appropriate control
measures are also evidenced by well-defined organizational responsibilities,
management selection, development and evaluation processes, communication
techniques, financial planning and reporting systems and formalized procedures.
In addition, internal auditors monitor the operation of the internal control
system and report findings and recommendations to management and the audit
committee, and corrective actions are taken to remedy deficiencies if and when
they are identified.

Ernst & Young LLP, independent auditors, is engaged to audit our financial
statements. Ernst & Young LLP maintains an understanding of our internal
controls and conducts such tests and other auditing procedures considered
necessary in the circumstances to express their opinion on our financial
statements in the report that follows.

The Audit Committee, composed entirely of nonemployee directors, meets
periodically with the independent auditors, management and internal auditors to
review their work and confirm they are properly performing their duties. Both
the internal and independent auditors have unrestricted access to the
Committee, without the presence of management, to discuss any appropriate
matters.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Pulte Homes, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pulte Homes,
Inc. as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2002. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Pulte
Homes, Inc. at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2002 the
Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill.
