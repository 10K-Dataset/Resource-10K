PULTE HOMES, INC.




PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Pulte Homes, Inc.

Pulte Homes, Inc. is a publicly held holding company whose subsidiaries engage in the
homebuilding and financial services businesses. Pulte Homes, Inc. is a Michigan corporation and
was organized in 1956. Our assets consist principally of the capital stock of our subsidiaries and
our income primarily consists of dividends from our subsidiaries. Our direct subsidiaries include
Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc., Del Webb Corporation (“Del Webb”) and other subsidiaries engaged
in the homebuilding business. Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc.’s operating subsidiaries include
Pulte Home Corporation, Pulte International Corporation (“International”) and other subsidiaries
engaged in the homebuilding business. Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc.’s non-operating thrift
subsidiary, First Heights Holding Corp, LLC (“First Heights”), is classified as a discontinued
operation (see Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements). We also have a mortgage banking
company, Pulte Mortgage LLC (“Pulte Mortgage”), which is a subsidiary of Pulte Home Corporation.

In December 2005, we sold substantially all of our Mexico homebuilding operations, realizing
cash of $131.5 million, as further described in Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements.
For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Mexico operations have been presented as
discontinued operations.

In January 2005, we sold all of our Argentina operations, as further described in Note 3 of
our Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Argentina
operations have been presented as discontinued operations.

Homebuilding, our core business, is engaged in the acquisition and development of land
principally for residential purposes within the continental United States and Puerto Rico and the
construction of housing on such land targeted for the first-time, first and second move-up, and
active adult home buyers. We have determined our operating segments to be our Areas, which are
aggregated into seven reportable segments based on similarities in the economic and geographic
characteristics of our homebuilding operations. Accordingly, our reportable homebuilding
segments are as follows:

We also have one reportable segment for our financial services operations which consists
principally of mortgage banking and title operations conducted through Pulte Mortgage and our other
subsidiaries. Our financial services segment operates generally in the same markets as our
homebuilding segments.



Pulte Homes, Inc. (continued)

Financial information, including revenues, income (loss) from continuing operations before income

Through our brands, which include Pulte Homes, Del Webb and DiVosta, we offer a wide variety
of home designs including single family detached, townhouses, condominiums and duplexes at
different prices and with varying levels of options and amenities to all of our major customer
segments: first-time, first and second move-up and active adult. Expanding the number of customer
segments served within each of our markets has enabled us to significantly increase our annual unit
settlements over the past five years to 41,487 homes closed in 2006. Over our 56-year history, we
have delivered nearly 500,000 homes.

As of December 31, 2006, our Homebuilding operations offered homes for sale in 690
communities. Sales prices of homes currently offered for sale in 70% of our communities fall
within the range of $100,000 to $400,000 with a 2006 average unit selling price of $337,000,
compared with $315,000 in 2005, $287,000 in 2004, $259,000 in 2003, and $242,000 in 2002. Sales of
single-family detached homes, as a percentage of total unit sales, were 74% in 2006, compared with
72% in 2005, 80% in 2004, 83% in 2003, and 86% in 2002. The decline in the percentage of
single-family detached homes can be attributed to an increase in sales of townhouses, condominiums
and duplexes, which are most popular among our first-time and active adult homebuyers. Our
Homebuilding operations are geographically diverse and, as a result, better insulate us from demand
changes in individual markets. As of December 31, 2006, our Homebuilding business operated in 52
markets spanning 27 states.

Land acquisition and development

We select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing extensive
market research, enabling us to match the location and product offering with our targeted consumer
group. We consider factors such as proximity to developed areas, population and job growth
patterns and, if applicable, estimated development costs. We historically have managed the risk of
controlling our land positions through use of option contracts and outright acquisition. We
typically control land with the intent to complete sales of housing units within 24 to 36 months
from the date of opening a community, except in the case of certain Del Webb active adult
developments and other selected large projects for which the completion of community build out
requires a longer time period due to typically larger project sizes. As a result, land is
generally purchased after it is properly zoned and developed or is ready for development. In
addition, we dispose of owned land not required in the business through sales to appropriate end
users. Where we develop land, we engage directly in many phases of the development process,
including land and site planning, obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals, as well
as constructing roads, sewers, water and drainage facilities and other amenities. We use our staff
and the services of independent engineers and consultants for land development activities. Land
development work is performed primarily by independent contractors and local government authorities
who construct sewer and water systems in some areas. At December 31, 2006, we controlled
approximately 232,200 lots, of which 158,800 were owned and 73,400 were under option agreements.



Homebuilding Operations (continued)

Sales and marketing

We are dedicated to improving the quality and value of our homes through innovative
proprietary architectural and community designs and state-of-the-art customer marketing techniques.
Analyzing various qualitative and quantitative data obtained through extensive market research, we
segment our potential customers into well-defined buyer profiles. Segmentation analysis provides a
method for understanding the business opportunities and risks across the full spectrum of consumer
groups in each market. Once the demands of potential buyers are understood, we link our home
design and community development efforts to the specific lifestyle of each targeted consumer group.

To meet the demands of our various customers, we have established a solid design expertise for
a wide array of product lines. We believe that we are an innovator in the design of our homes and
we view design capacity as an integral aspect of our marketing strategy. Our in-house
architectural services teams and management, supplemented by outside consultants, are successful in
creating distinctive design features, both in exterior facades and interior options and features.
In certain markets our strategy is to offer “the complete house” in which all features shown in the
home are included in the sales price. Standard features typically offered include vaulted
ceilings, appliances, and a variety of available flooring and carpet.

Typically, our sales teams, together with outside sales brokers, are responsible for guiding
the customer through the sales process. We are committed to industry-leading customer service
through a variety of quality initiatives, including the customer care program, which ensures that
homeowners are comfortable at every stage of the building process. Using a seven-step, interactive
process, homeowners are kept informed during their homebuilding and home owning experience. The
steps include (1) a pre-construction meeting with the superintendent; (2) pre-dry wall frame walk;
(3) quality assurance inspection; (4) first homeowner orientation; (5) 30-day follow-up after the
close of the home; (6) three-month follow-up; and (7) an 11-month quality list after the close of
the home. Fully furnished and landscaped model homes are used to showcase our homes and their
distinctive design features. We have great success with the first-time buyer in the low to
moderate price range; in such cases, financing under United States Government-insured and
guaranteed programs is often used and is facilitated through our mortgage company. We also enjoy
strong sales to the move-up buyer and, in certain markets, offer semi-custom homes in higher price
ranges.

Through our Del Webb brand, we are better able to address the needs of active adults, among
the fastest growing homebuying segments. We offer both destination communities and “in place”
communities, for those buyers who prefer to remain in their current geographic area. These
communities, with highly amenitized products such as golf courses, recreational centers and
educational classes, offer the active adult buyer many options to maintain an active lifestyle.

We have received recognition and awards as a result of our achievements as a homebuilder. In
September 2006, Pulte was named among the Top 100 on the InformationWeek 100 list, an award
honoring the nation’s most innovative users of information technology. In April 2006, we were
ranked number 147 on the FORTUNE 500 List. Additionally, in July 2006 we were named to the FORTUNE
Global 500 list.

In addition, our Maryland, Washington D.C., Orlando, Tampa Bay (DiVosta), Jacksonville, Ft.
Myers/Naples (DiVosta), Palm Beach (DiVosta), Dallas/Ft. Worth, Houston, Denver/Colorado Springs,
Albuquerque, Las Vegas (Del Webb), Tucson and Central Valley, California divisions were recognized
for ranking the highest in their markets in a national customer satisfaction study. Twelve of our
divisions ranked second in their respective markets, while ten divisions ranked third. Pulte
brands, which include Pulte Homes, Del Webb and DiVosta, were surveyed in 30 of the 34 total
markets analyzed. The survey noted customer service, home readiness at the time of closing, and the
company’s sales staff as the three factors that most heavily influenced the customer’s overall
level of satisfaction. Developing the Pulte Homes brand and leveraging the strength of the DiVosta
and Del Webb brand names helps to distinguish our communities from the competition, and often
results in the advantages of additional sales pace, choice community locations, and reduced overall
customer acquisition costs.

Our Homeowner for Life

TM

philosophy has increased our business from those who have
previously owned a Pulte home or have been referred by a Pulte homeowner by ensuring a positive
home buying and home owning experience. We introduce our homes to prospective buyers through a
variety of media advertising, illustrated brochures, Internet listings and link placements, and
other advertising displays. In addition, our websites,

www.pulte.com, www.delwebb.com, and
www.divosta.com

provide tools to help users find a home that meets their needs, investigate
financing alternatives, communicate moving plans, maintain a home, learn more about us and
communicate directly with us. Approximately 5.4 million potential customers visited our websites
during 2006.



Homebuilding Operations (continued)

Construction

The construction process for our homes begins with the in-house design of the homes we sell.
The building phase is conducted under the supervision of our on-site construction superintendents.
The construction work is usually performed by independent contractors under contracts that, in many
instances, cover both labor and materials on a fixed-price basis. In certain markets, we provide a
unique design and production process that is highly efficient, and results in lower costs, higher
overall specification and increased value to our customers. We believe that Pulte Preferred
Partnerships (P


), an extension of our quality assurance program, continues to establish
new standards for contractor relations. Using a selective process, we have teamed up with what we
believe are premier contractors and suppliers to improve all aspects of the land development and
house construction processes.

We maintain efficient construction operations by using standard materials and components from
a variety of sources and, when possible, by building on contiguous lots. To minimize the effects
of changes in construction costs, the contracting and purchasing of building supplies and materials
generally is negotiated at or near the time when related sales contracts are signed. In addition,
we leverage our size by actively negotiating our materials needs on a national or regional basis to
minimize production component cost. We are also working to establish a more integrated system that
can effectively link suppliers, contractors and the production schedule through various strategic
business partnerships and e-business initiatives.

We cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials will be available at
reasonable prices in the future and have, on occasion, experienced shortages of skilled labor in
certain trades and of building materials in some markets.

Competition and other factors

Our operations are subject to building, environmental and other regulations of various
federal, state, and local governing authorities. For our homes to qualify for Federal Housing
Administration (“FHA”) or Veterans Administration (“VA”) mortgages, we must satisfy valuation
standards and site, material and construction requirements of those agencies. Our compliance with
federal, state, and local laws relating to protection of the environment has had, to date, no
material effect upon capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. More stringent
requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers, thereby increasing the
cost of compliance.

Our dedication to customer satisfaction is evidenced by our consumer and value-based brand
approach to product development, and is something that we believe distinguishes us in the
homebuilding industry and contributes to our long-term competitive advantage. The housing industry
in the United States, however, is highly competitive. In each of our market areas, there are
numerous homebuilders with which we compete. We also compete with the resales of existing house
inventory. Any provider of housing units, for-sale or to rent, including apartment builders, may
be considered a competitor. Conversion of apartments to condominiums further provides certain
segments of the population an alternative to traditional housing, as does manufactured housing. We
compete primarily on the basis of price, reputation, design, location and quality of our homes.
The housing industry is affected by a number of economic and other factors including: (1)
significant national and world events, which impact consumer confidence; (2) changes in the costs
of building materials and labor; (3) changes in interest rates; (4) changes in other costs
associated with home ownership, such as property taxes and energy costs; (5) various demographic
factors; (6) changes in federal income tax laws; (7) changes in government mortgage financing
programs, and (8) availability of sufficient mortgage capacity. In addition to these factors, our
business and operations could be affected by shifts in demand for new homes.

Financial Services Operations

We conduct our financial services business, which includes mortgage and title operations,
through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries. Our mortgage bank arranges financing through the
origination of mortgage loans primarily for the benefit of our homebuyers. We also engage in the
sale of such loans and the related servicing rights. We are a lender approved by the FHA and VA
and are a seller/servicer approved by Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”), Federal
National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”) and other
investors. In our conventional mortgage lending activities we follow underwriting guidelines
established by FNMA, FHLMC, and private investors.

Our mortgage underwriting, processing and closing functions are centralized in Denver,
Colorado and Charlotte, North Carolina using a mortgage operations center (“MOC”) concept. We
also use a centralized telephone loan officer concept where loan officers are centrally located at
mortgage application centers (“MAC”) in Denver and Charlotte. In addition, during 2006, we
initiated a web application program in certain markets. Once the loan applications are received,
our sales representatives, who are the mortgage customers’ main contact, forward them to a MAC loan
counselor who calls the customer to complete the loan application and then forwards it to the MOC
for processing. We believe both the MOC and the MAC improve the speed and efficiency of our
mortgage operations, thereby improving our profitability and allowing us to focus on creating
attractive mortgage financing opportunities for our customers.



Financial Services Operations (continued)

In originating mortgage loans, we initially use our own funds and borrowings made available to
us through various credit arrangements. Subsequently, we sell such mortgage loans and
mortgage-backed securities to outside investors.

Our capture rate for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 was approximately 91%,
89%, and 88%, respectively. Our capture rate represents loan originations from our homebuilding
business as a percent of total loan opportunities, excluding cash settlements, from our
homebuilding business. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, we originated
mortgage loans for approximately 77%, 75%, and 72%, respectively, of the homes we sold. Such
originations represented nearly 100%, 98%, and 92%, respectively, of our total originations.
During 2006, 21% of total origination dollars were from brokered loans, which are less profitable
to us, compared with 26% and 36% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in brokered loans
can be attributed to a shift in product mix towards funded production.

We sell our servicing rights monthly on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales
contracts to reduce the risks inherent in servicing loans. This strategy results in owning the
servicing rights for only a short period of time, which substantially reduces the risk of
impairment with respect to the fair value of these reported assets. The servicing sales contracts
provide for the reimbursement of payments made when loans prepay within specified periods of time,
usually 90 days after sale or securitization.

The mortgage industry in the United States is highly competitive. We compete with other
mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide attractive mortgage financing to both our
homebuyers and to the general public. The Internet is also an important resource for homebuyers in
obtaining financing as a number of companies provide online approval for their customers. These
Internet-based mortgage companies may also be considered competitors.

In originating and servicing mortgage loans, we are subject to rules and regulations of the
FHA, VA, GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC. In addition to being affected by changes in these programs, our
mortgage banking business is also affected by several of the same factors that impact our
homebuilding business.

Our subsidiary title insurance companies serve as title insurance agents in selected markets
by providing title insurance policies, examination and closing services to buyers of homes we sell.

Financial Information About Geographic Areas

We currently operate primarily within the United States. However, we have some non-operating
foreign entities, which are insignificant to our consolidated financial results.

Discontinued Operations

Mexico Homebuilding Operations

In January 2005, the minority shareholders of Pulte Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V. (“Pulte Mexico”)
exercised a put option under the terms of a reorganization agreement dated as of December 31, 2001,
to sell their shares to us, the consummation of which resulted in our owning 100% of Pulte Mexico.
In March 2005, we purchased 60% of the minority interest of Pulte Mexico for approximately $18.7
million in cash. In June 2005, we purchased the remaining 40% of the minority interest of Pulte
Mexico for approximately $12.5 million in cash.

In December 2005, we sold substantially all of our Mexico homebuilding operations to a
consortium of purchasers involved in residential and commercial real estate development. The
disposition of the Mexico homebuilding operations will enable us to invest additional resources in
the U.S. housing market. We realized cash of $131.5 million related to the sale. The sale of
these operations did not include our investment in the capital stock of a mortgage company in
Mexico as well as various non-operating entities. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we
recognized a pre-tax loss of $6.6 million (after-tax loss of $13.1 million) related to the sale of
our Mexico homebuilding operations. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Mexico
homebuilding operations have been presented as discontinued operations in our Consolidated
Financial Statements.



Discontinued Operations (continued)

Argentina

In January 2005, we sold all of our Argentina operations to an Argentine company involved in
residential and commercial real estate development. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the
Argentina operations are presented as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Financial
Statements.

First Heights

During the first quarter of 1994, we adopted a plan of disposal for First Heights and
announced our strategy to exit the thrift industry and increase our focus on housing and related
mortgage banking. First Heights sold all but one of its 32 bank branches and related deposits to
two unrelated purchasers. The sale was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 1994.
Although we expected to complete the plan of disposal within a reasonable period of time,
contractual disputes precluded us from completing the disposal in accordance with our original
plan.

In August 2005, the United States Court of Appeals affirmed the United States Court of Federal
Claims final judgment that we had been damaged by approximately $48.7 million as a result of the
United States government’s breach of contract in connection with the enactment of Section 13224 of
the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. In December 2005, we received payment of the
judgment in the amount of $48.7 million, which was recorded as income from discontinued operations.

In September 2005, First Heights received notice confirming the voluntary dissolution of the
First Heights Bank. The Office of Thrift Supervision also canceled First Heights’ charter.
Accordingly, the day-to-day activities of First Heights, which had been principally devoted to
supporting residual regulatory compliance matters and the litigation with the United States
government, have now ceased.

Other non-operating

Other non-operating is comprised primarily of Pulte Homes, Inc. and Pulte Diversified
Companies, Inc., both of which are holding companies. The primary purpose of these entities is to
support the operations of our subsidiaries by acting as the internal source of financing,
developing and implementing strategic initiatives centered around new business development and
operating efficiencies. Business development activities include the pursuit of additional
opportunities as well as the development of innovative building components and processes. Other
non-operating also includes the activities associated with supporting a publicly traded entity
listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

Other non-operating assets include equity investments in subsidiaries, short-term financial
instruments and affiliate advances. Liabilities include senior debt and income taxes. Other
non-operating revenues consist primarily of investment earnings of excess funds, while expenses
include costs associated with supporting a publicly traded company and its subsidiaries’
operations, and investigating strategic initiatives.

Organization/Employees

All subsidiaries and operating units operate independently with respect to daily operations.
Homebuilding real estate purchases and other significant homebuilding, mortgage banking, financing
activities and similar operating decisions must be approved by the business unit and/or corporate
senior management.

At December 31, 2006, we employed approximately 12,400 people. Our employees are not
represented by any union. Contracted work, however, may be performed by union contractors.
Homebuilding and mortgage banking management personnel are paid performance bonuses and incentive
compensation. Performance bonuses are based on individual performance while incentive compensation
is based on the performance of the applicable business unit, subsidiary or the Company. Our
corporate management personnel are paid incentive compensation based on our overall performance.
Each subsidiary is given autonomy regarding employment of personnel, although our senior corporate
management acts in an advisory capacity in the employment of subsidiary officers. We consider our
employee and contractor relations to be satisfactory.



ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on Form 10-K should
be read together with the risk factors set forth below. They describe various risks and
uncertainties to which we are, or may become subject. These risks and uncertainties, together with
other factors described elsewhere in this report, have the potential to affect our business,
financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies or prospects in a material and
adverse manner.

Downward changes in general economic, real estate construction or other business conditions could
adversely affect our business or our financial results.

The residential homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other
factors, such as the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of
financing and interest rate levels. Adverse changes in any of these conditions generally, or in
the markets where we operate, could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or
result in customer cancellations of pending contracts, which could adversely affect the number of
home deliveries we make or reduce the prices we can charge for homes, either of which could result
in a decrease in our revenues and earnings and would adversely affect our financial condition.

The homebuilding industry is currently experiencing an economic down cycle, which has resulted in
the overvaluation of land and new homes in certain markets.

In recent years, land and home prices rose significantly in many of our markets. However,
during the year ended December 31, 2006, the homebuilding industry was impacted by lack of consumer
confidence, decreased housing affordability and large supplies of resale and new home inventories
which resulted in an industry-wide softening of demand for new homes. As a result of these
factors, we are experiencing slower sales and higher cancellations which have impacted most of our
markets and therefore, we are making greater use of sales incentives. We cannot predict the
duration or the severity of the current market conditions, nor provide any assurances that the
adjustments we have made in our operating strategy to address these conditions will be successful.

If the market value of our land and homes drops significantly, our profits could decrease.

The market value of land, building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as
a result of changing market conditions and the measures we employ to manage inventory risk may not
be adequate to insulate our operations from a severe drop in inventory values. We acquire land for
expansion into new markets and for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current
markets. If housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory, we
may not be able to make profits similar to what we have made in the past, we may experience less
than anticipated profits and/or we may not be able to recover our costs when we sell and build
homes. When market conditions are such that land values are not appreciating, option arrangements
previously entered into may become less desirable, at which time we may elect to forego deposits
and pre-acquisition costs and terminate the agreement. In the face of adverse market conditions,
we may have substantial inventory carrying costs, we may have to write-down our inventory to its
fair value, and/or we may have to sell land or homes at a loss.

As a result of the changing market conditions in the real estate industry which occurred
during the year ended December 31, 2006, our land inventories and communities under development
demonstrated impairment indicators which were evaluated for potential impairment. Consequently, we
recorded land and community valuation adjustments of $203.8 million to reduce the carrying value of
the impaired projects to their estimated fair values and we also recorded $95.4 million of land and
community valuation adjustments related to our unconsolidated joint ventures. In addition, we
recorded $54.6 million of net realizable value adjustments to land held for sale and $151.2 million
for the write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs for land option contracts we no longer plan
to pursue. It is possible that the estimated cash flows from these projects may change and could
result in a future need to record additional valuation or net realizable adjustments.
Additionally, if conditions in the homebuilding industry worsen in the future, we may be required
to evaluate additional projects for potential impairment which may result in additional valuation
and net realizable value adjustments which could be significant.



Our success depends on our ability to acquire land suitable for residential homebuilding at
reasonable prices, in accordance with our land investment criteria.

The homebuilding industry is highly competitive for suitable land. The availability of
finished and partially finished developed lots and undeveloped land for purchase that meet our
internal criteria depends on a number of factors outside our control, including land availability
in general, competition with other homebuilders and land buyers for desirable property, inflation
in land prices, and zoning, allowable housing density and other regulatory requirements. Should
suitable lots or land become less available, the number of homes we may be able to build and sell
could be reduced, and the cost of land could be increased, perhaps substantially, which could
adversely impact our results of operations.

Our long-term ability to build homes depends on our acquiring land suitable for residential
building at reasonable prices in locations where we want to build. Over the past few years, we
have experienced an increase in competition for suitable land as a result of land constraints in
many of our markets. As competition for suitable land increases, and as available land is
developed, the cost of acquiring suitable remaining land could rise, and the availability of
suitable land at acceptable prices may decline. Any land shortages or any decrease in the supply
of suitable land at reasonable prices could limit our ability to develop new communities or result
in increased land costs. We may not be able to pass through to our customers any increased land
costs, which could adversely impact our revenues, earnings, and margins.

Future increases in interest rates, reductions in mortgage availability or increases in the
effective costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and
adversely affect our business or our financial results.

Most of our customers finance their home purchases through our mortgage bank. Interest rates
have been at historical lows for several years. Many homebuyers have also chosen adjustable rate,
interest only or mortgages that involve initial lower monthly payments. As a result, new homes
have been more affordable. Increases in interest rates or decreases in availability of mortgage
financing, however, could reduce the market for new homes. Potential homebuyers may be less
willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs or to obtain mortgage financing that exposes
them to interest rate changes. Lenders may increase the qualifications needed for mortgages or
adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk. Even if potential customers do not need
financing, changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to
sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing. These factors could adversely
affect the sales or pricing of our homes and could also reduce the volume or margins in our
financial services business. Our financial services business could be impacted to the extent we
are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate through the
various hedging strategies we employ.

In addition, we believe that the availability of FHA and VA mortgage financing is an important
factor in marketing some of our homes. We also believe that the liquidity provided by Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac to the mortgage industry is important to the housing market. However, the federal
government has recently sought to reduce the size of the home-loan portfolios and operations of
these two government-sponsored enterprises. Any limitations or restrictions on the availability of
the financing or on the liquidity by them could adversely affect interest rates, mortgage financing
and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans.

Our future growth may require additional capital, which may not be available.

Our operations require significant amounts of cash. We may be required to seek additional
capital, whether from sales of equity or debt or additional bank borrowings, for the future growth
and development of our business. We can give no assurance as to the availability of such
additional capital or, if available, whether it would be on terms acceptable to us. Moreover, the
indentures for most of our outstanding public debt and the covenants of our revolving credit
facility contain provisions that may restrict the debt we may incur in the future. If we are not
successful in obtaining sufficient capital, it could reduce our sales and may adversely affect our
future growth and financial results.

Competition for homebuyers could reduce our deliveries or decrease our profitability.

The housing industry in the United States is highly competitive. We compete primarily on the
basis of price, reputation, design, location and quality of our homes. We compete in each of our
markets with numerous national, regional and local homebuilders. This competition with other
homebuilders could reduce the number of homes we deliver, or cause us to accept reduced margins in
order to maintain sales volume.

We also compete with resales of existing used or foreclosed homes, housing speculators and
available rental housing. Increased competitive conditions in the residential resale or rental
market in the regions where we operate could decrease demand for new homes and increase
cancellations of sales contracts in backlog.



Supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials
could increase costs and delay deliveries.

The homebuilding industry is highly competitive for skilled labor and materials. Increased
costs or shortages of skilled labor and/or lumber, framing, concrete, steel and other building
materials could cause increases in construction costs and construction delays. The current
national debate related to immigration reform could impact the related laws and regulations in the
markets in which we operate, and result in shortages of skilled labor and higher labor and
compliance costs, potentially affecting our ability to complete construction and land development.
We generally are unable to pass on increases in construction costs to those customers who have
already entered into sale contracts, as those sales contracts generally fix the price of the home
at the time the contract is signed, which may be well in advance of the construction of the home.
Sustained increases in construction costs may, over time, erode our margins, and pricing
competition for materials and labor may restrict our ability to pass on any additional costs,
thereby decreasing our margins.

Government regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and
homebuilding projects or affect our related financial services operations and adversely affect our
business or financial results.

Our operations are subject to building, environmental and other regulations of various
federal, state, and local governing authorities. For our homes to qualify for FHA or VA mortgages,
we must satisfy valuation standards and site, material and construction requirements of those
agencies. Our compliance with federal, state, and local laws relating to protection of the
environment has had, to date, no material effect upon capital expenditures, earnings or competitive
position. More stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and
developers, thereby increasing the cost of compliance.

New housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools, parks, streets and
other public improvements. These can cause an increase in the effective prices for our homes. In
addition, increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities, as recently
experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding, can adversely affect the ability of
potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes.

We also are subject to a variety of local, state and federal laws and regulations concerning
protection of health, safety and the environment. The impact of environmental laws varies
depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in
areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available. These
matters may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance, remediation and other
costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in
environmentally sensitive regions or areas.

Our financial services operations are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws
and regulations. These include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs
and compliance with consumer lending and similar requirements such as disclosure requirements,
prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures. They may also subject
our operations to examination by applicable agencies. These may limit our ability to provide
mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes.

Homebuilding is subject to warranty and liability claims in the ordinary course of business that
can be significant.

As a homebuilder, we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in
the ordinary course of business. We record warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based
on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with
the types of homes built. We have, and require the majority of our subcontractors to have, general
liability, property, errors and omissions, workers compensations and other business insurance.
These insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims, subject to
certain self-insured retentions, deductibles, and other coverage limits. Through our captive
insurance subsidiaries, we reserve for costs to cover our self-insured and deductible amounts under
these policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits, based on an analysis of our historical
claims, which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Because of the
uncertainties inherent to these matters, we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage,
our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all our warranty and
construction defect claims in the future. Contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce, we
may be responsible for applicable self-insured retentions and some types of claims may not be
covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits. Additionally, the coverage offered
by and the availability of general liability insurance for construction defects are currently
limited and costly. We have responded to the recent increases in insurance costs and coverage
limitations by increasing our self-insured retentions and claim reserves. There can be no
assurance that coverage will not be further restricted and become more costly.



Natural disasters and severe weather conditions could delay deliveries, increase costs and decrease
demand for new homes in affected areas.

Our homebuilding operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters
and severe weather. The occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new
home deliveries, increase costs by damaging inventories, reduce the availability of materials and
negatively impact the demand for new homes in affected areas. Furthermore, if our insurance does
not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events, our earnings,
liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected.

Inflation may result in increased costs that we may not be able to recoup if demand declines.

Inflation can have a long-term impact on us because increasing costs of land, materials and
labor may require us to increase the sales prices of homes in order to maintain satisfactory
margins. However, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which have a negative
impact on housing demand, in which case we may not be able to raise home prices sufficiently to
keep up with the rate of inflation and our margins could decrease.

Future terrorist attacks against the United States or increased domestic and international
instability could have an adverse effect on our operations.

A future terrorist attack against the United States could cause a sharp decrease in the number
of new contracts signed for homes and an increase in the cancellation of existing contracts.
Accordingly, adverse developments in the war on terrorism, future terrorist attacks against the
United States, or increased domestic and international instability could adversely affect our
business.



ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

This Item is not applicable.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Our homebuilding and corporate headquarters are located at 100 Bloomfield Hills Parkway,
Bloomfield Hills, Michigan 48304, where we lease 155,392 square feet of office space. We lease
54,380 square feet of office space at 1230 West Washington Street, Tempe, Arizona 85281 for certain
corporate and business services. Pulte Mortgage’s offices are located at 7475 South Joliet Street,
Englewood, Colorado 80112, 99 Inverness Drive East, Englewood, Colorado 80112, and 12300 East
Arapahoe Road, Centennial, Colorado 80112. We lease approximately 61,436 square feet, 24,400
square feet and 43,050 square feet, respectively, of office space at these locations. Pulte
Mortgage also leases 31,803 square feet of office space at 3700 Arco Corporate Drive, Charlotte,
North Carolina 28273. Our homebuilding markets and mortgage branch operations generally lease
office space for their day-to-day operations.

Because of the nature of our homebuilding operations, significant amounts of property are held
as inventory in the ordinary course of our homebuilding business. Such properties are not included
in response to this Item.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are involved in various legal and governmental proceedings incidental to our continuing
business operations, many involving claims related to certain construction defects. The
consequences of these matters are not presently determinable but, in our opinion after consulting
with legal counsel and taking into account insurance and reserves, the ultimate liability is not
expected to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash
flows.

Storm Water Discharge Practices

In July 2006, one of our 50%-owned, unconsolidated joint ventures located in Northern
California received a civil liability complaint from the Central Valley Regional Water Quality
Control Board pursuant to the Clean Water Act and Sections 13376 and 13385 of the California Water
Code. The complaint sought information about storm water discharge practices in connection with
homebuilding projects completed or underway by our joint venture. Our joint venture entered into
settlement negotiations with the Regional Board to resolve this matter. The final settlement
imposes an administrative civil liability of $200,000 and requires the completion of a Supplemental
Environmental Project (SEP) at a cost of not less than $500,000. As of December 31, 2006 our joint
venture has accrued for costs associated with the resolution of this matter. Accordingly, we have
recorded our 50% proportionate share of the joint venture loss at December 31, 2006.

In April 2004, we received a request for information from the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (“EPA”) pursuant to Section 308 of the Clean Water Act. The request seeks
information about storm water discharge practices in connection with homebuilding projects
completed or underway by us. We have provided the EPA with this information. Although the matter
has since been referred to the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) for enforcement, the EPA
has asked that we engage in “pre-filing” negotiations to resolve the matter short of litigation.
We are actively engaged in these negotiations. If the negotiations fail and the DOJ alleges that
we have violated regulatory requirements applicable to storm water discharges, the government may
seek injunctive relief and penalties. We believe that we have defenses to any such allegations.
At this time, however, we can neither predict the outcome of this inquiry, nor can we currently
estimate the costs that may be associated with its eventual resolution.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

During the year ended December 31, 2006, the U.S. housing market was impacted by a lack of
consumer confidence, decreased housing affordability, and large supplies of resale and new home
inventories and related pricing pressures. These factors contributed to weakened demand for new
homes, slower sales, higher cancellation rates, and increased price discounts and selling
incentives to attract homebuyers, compared with the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, when we
had experienced record growth in our homebuilding operations. As a result, gross margins recorded
during the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased from the same periods in the prior years. From
time to time, we write-off deposit and pre-acquisiton costs related to land and lot option contracts
which we no longer plan to pursue. As a result of changing market conditions during the year ended
December 31, 2006, we wrote-off deposit and pre-acquisition costs of $151.2 million related to land
transactions we no longer plan to pursue. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006,
we recorded land valuation and net realizable value adjustments of $353.8 million, including our
investment in unconsolidated joint ventures, to reduce the carrying value of these assets to fair
value. Our evaluation for these adjustments assumed our best estimate of cash flows for the
communities tested. If conditions in the homebuilding industry worsen in the future, we may be
required to evaluate for additional impairment, resulting in additional impairment charges that
could be significant.

We continue to operate our business with the expectation that these difficult market
conditions will continue to impact us for at least the near term. We have adjusted our approach to
land acquisition and construction practices, continuing to shorten our land pipeline, reduce
production volumes, and balance home price and profitability with sales pace. We are slowing down
planned land purchases and reducing our total number of controlled lots owned and under option.
Additionally, we are reducing the number of spec homes put into production. However, we continue
to purchase select land positions where it makes economic and strategic sense to do so. We believe
that these measures will help to strengthen our market position and allow us to take advantage of
opportunities that will develop in the future.

Overview (continued)

The following is a comparison of pre-tax income for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005
and 2004:

•

During 2006, demand for new homes weakened in many of our markets as a result of
increases in the supply of existing homes for sale, increases in incentives offered by
homebuilders and sellers of existing homes and increases in cancellation rates. These
factors negatively impacted the homebuilding industry and contributed to a 56%
decrease in the pre-tax income of our homebuilding operations for the year ended
December 31, 2006, compared with the prior year period. During 2005, strong demand
for new homes in many of our markets as well as geographic and product mix shifts
contributed to a 41% increase in the pre-tax income of our homebui1ding operations for
the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with the prior year period. For the year
ended December 31, 2006, pre-tax income was negatively impacted by $505 million of
valuation adjustments recorded to land inventory ($203.8 million) and land held for
sale ($54.6 million), our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures ($95.4 million)
and the write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs ($151.2 million) related to
land option contracts we no longer plan to pursue due to declining market conditions
in the homebuilding industry.

•

Pre-tax income from our financial services business segment increased 64% for the
year ended December 31, 2006, compared with the prior year period due to increased
origination volume, favorable product mix and a one-time gain of $31.6 million related
to the sale of our investment in Su Casita, a Mexican mortgage banking company.
Pre-tax income increased 49% for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared with the
prior year period. Capture rates were 91%, 89% and 88% for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

•

The decrease in non-operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006,
compared with the same period in the prior year, was due primarily to an increase in
the amount of interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory.

•

Loss from discontinued operations included a provision of $2.3 million, net of
taxes for the year ended December 31, 2006, resulting from a contractual adjustment
related to the December 2005 disposition of our Mexico homebuilding operations.
Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes a
$48.7 million payment received due to final judgment in litigation related to our
former thrift operation. Income (loss) from discontinued operations also includes
non-cash, after-tax gains of $7.8 million and $10.8 million realized during the years
ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, from the favorable resolution of
certain tax matters related to our former thrift operation. For the year ended
December 31, 2004, the sale of our Argentina homebuilding operations is included in
discontinued operations.

respectively.

(b)

Includes net realizable value adjustments for land held for sale of $54.6
million, $3.1 million and $265,000 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively.

(c)

Includes land and community valuation adjustments for two of our
unconsolidated joint ventures, which totaled $95.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2006.

(d)

Includes the write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs for land
option contracts we no longer plan to pursue of
$151.2 million, $19.2 million and $27 million for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2006, other
income (expense) also includes $18.5 million related to the closure of our
production facility in Virginia.

Home sale revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 were lower than those for the
prior year by approximately $395 million, or 3%. The decrease in homebuilding revenues was
attributable to a 9% decrease in the number of homes closed to 41,487, partially offset by a 7%
increase in the average selling price of homes delivered to $337,000. The increase in average
selling price reflects a combination of changes in product mix and geographic mix of homes closed
during the year ended December 31, 2006. Home sale revenues set a record for the year ended
December 31, 2005 at 45,630 units, an increase of 18% over the same period in 2004, while the 2005
average selling price for our homes increased 10% to $315,000, compared with 2004.

Homebuilding gross profit margins from home sales in 2006 decreased 600 basis points from 2005
to 17.4%, and in 2005 increased 80 basis points to 23.4% compared with 2004. The increase in
homebuilding gross profit margins in 2005 is due to strong consumer demand, positive home pricing,
favorable shifts in product and geographic mix, the benefits of leverage-buy purchasing activities
and effective production and inventory management. During the fourth quarter of 2006, homebuilding
gross profit margins were 11.0% compared with 22.3% and 22.7% in the same periods of 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The significant decrease in gross profit margins during 2006 is attributable to the
difficult market conditions and challenging sales environment where we have realized increased
sales incentives and increased material and labor costs related to homes closed during the year.
Additionally, during 2006, we identified communities under development that demonstrated potential
impairment indicators which were evaluated for potential impairment in accordance with SFAS No.
144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

(SFAS 144). Consequently,
during the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded respective land valuation
adjustments of $146 million and $203.8 million, which included capitalized interest of $16 million,
to reduce the carrying value of the impaired projects to their estimated fair value. There were no
significant land valuation adjustments recorded during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.



Homebuilding Operations (continued)

We consider land acquisition and development to be one of our core competencies. We acquire
land primarily for the construction of our homes for sale to homebuyers. We select locations for
development of homebuilding communities after completing extensive market research, enabling us to
match the location and product offering with our targeted consumer group. Where we develop land,
we engage directly in many phases of the development process, including land and site planning,
obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals, as well as constructing roads, sewers,
water and drainage facilities and other amenities. We will often sell select parcels of land
within or adjacent to our communities to retail and commercial establishments. We also will, on
occasion, sell lots within our communities to other homebuilders. Gross profit (loss) from land
sales was ($38.7) million, $18.2 million and $99.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively. Revenues and their related gains/losses may vary significantly
between periods, depending on the timing of land sales. We continue to evaluate our existing land
positions to ensure the most effective use of capital. Land held for disposition was approximately
$465.8 million as of December 31, 2006, compared with $257.7 million and $230.1 million at December
31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, we
recorded net realizable value adjustments for land held for sale of $25.8 million and $54.6
million, respectively. There were no significant net realizable value adjustments for land held
for sale during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a
percentage of home settlement revenues, increased 40 basis points to 8.1% compared with 2005, after
decreasing 110 basis points to 7.7% in 2005 compared with 2004. The decreased conversion in 2006
compared with the prior year was the result of lower home sale revenues, offset by our internal
initiatives focused on controlling costs in the current business environment. The conversion
improvement in 2005, compared with 2004, can be attributed to an increase in average selling
prices, our internal initiatives focused on controlling costs and better overhead leverage as a
result of volume increases.

The decrease in equity income of $167.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared
with the prior year period, is primarily the result of a $95.4 million land valuation adjustment
for two of our unconsolidated joint ventures, to reduce the carrying values of these investments to
their estimated fair values. Additionally, the decrease in 2006 equity income, compared with the
prior year, is also the result of our January 2006 acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in an
entity that supplies and installs basic building components and operating systems. As a result of
this acquisition, we own 100% of this entity, which is consolidated in our financial statements.
For the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, earnings for this investment were recorded in equity
income. In addition, earnings from our 50% investment in a Nevada-based joint venture, related to
the sale of commercial and residential properties, decreased in 2006 as the venture substantially
completed its operations in 2005.

Other income (expense), net includes the write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs
resulting from decisions not to pursue certain land acquisitions and options, insurance-related
expenses and settlements and other non-operating expenses. The changes in other income (expense),
net are due primarily to write-offs of deposit and pre-acquisition costs during the fourth quarter
of 2006, 2005 and 2004 of $82.7 million, $6.2 million and $13.8 million, respectively, and for the
years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 of $151.2 million, $19.2 million and $27 million,
respectively. These write-offs vary in amount from year to year as we continue to evaluate
potential land acquisitions for the most effective use of capital. During the fourth quarter and
year ended December 31, 2006 we recorded an $18.5 million charge related to the closure of a
production facility located in Virginia.

Unit settlements decreased 9% for the year ended December 31, 2006 to 41,487 units, compared
with the same period in 2005 and increased 18% for the year ended December 31, 2005 to 45,630
units, compared with the same period in 2004. The average selling price for homes closed for the
years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $337,000, $315,000 and $287,000, respectively.
Changes in average selling price reflect a number of factors, including changes in market selling
prices and the mix of product closed during each period.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, unit net new orders decreased 29% to 33,925 units,
compared with the same period in 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2005, unit net new orders
increased 17% to 47,531 units, compared with the same period in 2004. During 2006, net new orders
were impacted by the closeout of several large, established communities, where the replacement
communities are still in the early phases of development. In addition, rising home prices, higher
interest rates, and increased resale home inventories have negatively affected demand for new
homes. Cancellation rates for the fourth quarter of 2006 were approximately 34.7%, compared with
22.7% and 25.7% for the same periods in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Year to date cancellation
rates were 29.4% for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with 17.3% and 17.6% for the same
periods in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Most markets have experienced a substantial increase in
resale home inventory, and this, combined with declining consumer confidence, has resulted in
higher cancellation rates and reduced net new orders during 2006.



Homebuilding Operations (continued)

The dollar value of net new orders decreased 28% for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared
with the prior year period and increased 28% for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared with the
same period in 2004. However, while net new order dollars decreased during 2006, average selling
prices increased or remained stable in many of our markets, primarily as a result of favorable
shifts in product and geographic mix. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we had 690 active
selling communities, an increase of 4% from the same period in 2005. For the year ended December
31, 2005, we had 662 active selling communities, an increase of 6% from the same period in 2004.
Ending backlog, which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed, was 10,255 units at
December 31, 2006 with a dollar value of $3.6 billion. Ending backlog was 17,817 units at December
31, 2005 with a dollar value of $6.3 billion.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, our Homebuilding operations controlled approximately 232,200
and 362,600 lots, respectively. Approximately 158,800 and 173,800 lots were owned, and
approximately 63,700 and 133,400 lots were under option agreements approved for purchase at
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In addition, there were approximately 9,700 and 55,400
lots under option agreements, pending approval, at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. For
the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, we withdrew from land contracts representing
approximately 37,500 lots and 95,200 lots, respectively, valued at $1.2 billion and $3.8 billion,
respectively. We believe that the depth of our existing land supply, coupled with our entitlement
expertise, will enable us to continue opening new communities during the course of 2007 and beyond.

The total purchase price related to approved land under option for use by our Homebuilding
operations at future dates approximated $3.9 billion at December 31, 2006. In addition, total
purchase price related to land under option pending approval was valued at approximately $450.3
million at December 31, 2006. Land option agreements, which may be cancelled at our discretion,
may extend over several years and are secured by deposits and advanced costs totaling $369.5
million, of which $5.4 million is refundable and $12.9 million is related to deposits that our
Homebuilding operations have made in regards to lots optioned from an unconsolidated joint venture
in which we have an equity interest. This balance excludes $98.7 million of contingent payment
obligations which may or may not become actual obligations of the Company.

Homebuilding Segment Operations (continued)

Northeast:

For the year ended December 31, 2006, our Northeast operations experienced weakened
demand for new homes primarily as a result of increases in existing home inventories. Net new
orders for the fourth quarter of 2006 decreased 11% to 623 units, and for the year ended
December 31, 2006 decreased 30% to 2,813 units, compared with the same periods in 2005.
During 2006, increased cancellation rates were attributable to lower new order sign-up
activity and increased cancellations in all markets. For the fourth quarter of 2006
cancellation rates were approximately 25% compared with 19% for the same period in 2005.
Cancellation rates for fiscal year 2006 were 22%, compared with 14% for the same period in
2005. For the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, operating results were
negatively impacted by $12.2 million and $22.2 million of respective land valuation
adjustments taken in our New England markets as well as higher sales incentives offered to
homebuyers. During 2006, we also recorded $3.2 million of net realizable value adjustments
for land held for sale. During the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, we
wrote-off $17.7 million and $33.8 million, respectively, of deposits and pre-acquisition costs
associated with transactions we no longer plan to pursue, resulting in a reduction of lots
controlled of approximately 6,800 and 12,900, respectively. There were no significant land
valuation adjustments or write-offs taken during the same periods in 2005 and 2004.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, our Northeast operations contributed positively to
our Homebuilding operating results with increased revenues and higher average selling prices
and profits compared with 2004. During 2005, most of the markets in the Northeast experienced
strong demand conditions, particularly in Lehigh Valley and Baltimore, which were offset by
increased resale inventories and pricing pressures in Washington D.C. Net new orders
increased 26% to 4,019 units for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared with the same
period in 2004. However, during the fourth quarter of 2005, net new orders decreased 10% to
697 units compared with the fourth quarter of 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005,
cancellation rates were approximately 14% compared with 11% for the same period in 2004.
Cancellation rates for the fourth quarter of 2005 increased to 19% compared with 14% for the
same period in 2004. As of December 31, 2005, we had 99 active selling communities, compared
with 78 as of December 31, 2004. In addition, the year-over-year comparability of our
Northeast operations was affected by a significant land sale ($19.4 million of income before
income taxes) in our Washington D.C. market during the year ended December 31, 2004.

Southeast:

During the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, our Southeast operations
contributed positively to our Homebuilding operating results, evidenced by increased revenues
and unit settlements as well as higher average selling prices and profits compared with prior
year periods. The increases in the Southeast’s profitability are attributable to a continued
shift in product mix associated with the active adult homebuyer. Additionally, we opened a
new large active adult community in Charlotte during 2006. Net new orders for the fourth
quarter of 2006 decreased 27% to 715 units, and for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased
5% to 4,632 units, compared with the same periods in 2005. The reduction in new orders during
the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006 contributed to the increase in
cancellation rates. Cancellation rates for the fourth quarter of 2006 were approximately 35%,
compared with 23% for the same periods in 2005, while cancellation rates were 24% for the year
ended December 31, 2006, compared with 18% for the same period in 2005. During 2006, selling,
general and administrative expenses decreased as we continue to align our operations to meet
current market conditions. There were no significant land related valuation adjustments or
write-offs taken during 2006, 2005 or 2004 in our Southeast markets.

Most of the markets in the Southeast experienced strong demand conditions during 2005.
Additionally, during 2005 we opened several new communities, including two new active adult
communities in Atlanta and Raleigh. As of December 31, 2005, we had 64 active selling
communities, compared with 74 as of December 31, 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005,
net new orders increased 26% to 4,888 units compared with the same period in 2004. Net new
orders for the fourth quarter of 2005 increased 7% to 976 units, compared with the same
periods in 2004. Cancellation rates for the year ended December 31, 2005 were approximately
18%, which was comparable with the same period in 2004. For the fourth quarter and year ended
2005, our Carolina operating results were negatively impacted by $7 million of lot cost
adjustments recorded primarily in Hilton Head.



Homebuilding Segment Operations (continued)

Florida:

During 2006, our Florida operations experienced weakened demand, largely attributable to
increased existing home inventories, especially in Orlando and Naples/Ft. Myers. During the
fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, Florida experienced high cancellation rates
and pricing pressures associated with excess inventories and aggressive sales incentives
offered by competitors. Net new orders for the fourth quarter of 2006 decreased 51% to 769
units, and for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased 46% to 4,501 units, compared with
the same periods in 2005. For the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, increased
cancellation rates were attributable to lower new order sign-up activity and increased
cancellations in all Florida markets. For the fourth quarter of 2006, cancellation rates were
approximately 40% compared with 17% for the same period in 2005, while cancellation rates for
the year ended December 31, 2006 were approximately 31% compared with 12% for the same period
in 2005. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased during 2006, as we continue
to align our operations to meet current market conditions. During the fourth quarter and year
ended December 31, 2006, we recorded valuation adjustments of $21.7 million and $22.7 million,
respectively, related to land inventory. During the fourth quarter and year ended December
31, 2006, we also recorded charges of $17.6 million and $25.1 million, respectively, for the
write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs associated with transactions we no longer plan
to pursue in Jacksonville and Southeast Florida. During the fourth quarter and year ended
December 31, 2006, these charges resulted in a reduction of lots controlled of approximately
3,800 and 10,500, respectively. There were no significant land valuation adjustments or
write-offs taken during the same periods in 2005 and 2004.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, our Florida operations had increased revenues
and higher average selling prices and profits compared with the same period in 2004. As of
December 31, 2005, we had 73 active selling communities, compared with 65 as of December 31,
2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005, net new orders increased 19% to 8,383 units
compared with 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2005, net new orders decreased 20% to 1,577
units compared with the prior year quarter, due primarily to a decreased community count of
approximately 20% in Tampa and the fact that we were transitioning out of a recently completed
active adult community in Ocala. Additionally, some of our Florida operations began to
experience weakened demand for new homes due to excess resale inventories and pricing
pressures in Orlando and Naples/Ft. Myers. At December 31, 2005 unit backlog decreased 9% to
4,085 units compared with the same period in 2004. Cancellation rates for the year ended
December 31, 2005 were approximately 12%, which was comparable with 2004. In addition, for
the year ended December 31, 2004, our Florida operations were affected by land sales (totaling
$14.4 million of income before income taxes), which occurred primarily in our Tampa and
Jacksonville markets.

Midwest:

The Midwest operations have been one of the most challenged areas in the country as
Cleveland and Michigan continue to experience weakened demand due to difficult local economic
conditions. Net new orders for the fourth quarter of 2006 decreased 40% to 749 units, and for
the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased 31% to 4,087 units, compared with the same periods
in 2005. During 2006, reduced new order sign-up activity resulted in higher cancellation
rates. For the fourth quarter of 2006 cancellation rates were approximately 22% compared with
18% for the same period in 2005, while cancellation rates for the year ended December 31, 2006
were approximately 17% compared with 13% for the same periods in 2005. For the fourth quarter
and year ended December 31, 2006, Midwest operating results were negatively impacted by land
and community valuation adjustments of $32.6 million and $52.6 million, respectively. During
the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006 we recorded net realizable value
adjustments for land held for sale of $5.1 million and $10.8 million, respectively. During
the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded charges of $9 million and
$24.9 million, respectively, for the write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs
associated with transactions we no longer plan to pursue in the Michigan, Minnesota and
Indianapolis markets, resulting in a reduction of lots controlled of 3,600 and 11,800,
respectively. There were no significant land valuation and net realizable adjustments or
write-offs taken during the same periods in 2005 and 2004.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, our Midwest operations realized increased revenues
compared with the same period in 2004, primarily due to higher unit settlements. During the
year ended December 31, 2005 average selling prices and profits decreased compared with the
same period in 2004. During 2005, some of our Midwest operations were impacted by weakened
demand for new homes due to increased resale home inventories and challenging local economic
conditions, especially in Michigan. However, other Midwest operations, such as Illinois,
Indianapolis and Ohio experienced solid demand, as evidenced by increased net new orders. For
the year ended December 31, 2005, net new orders increased 14% to 5,928 units compared with
2004. During the fourth quarter of 2005, net new orders increased 11% to 1,240 units compared
with the prior year period. In 2005, we opened large active adult communities in Detroit and
Cleveland which contributed to the 2005 increase in net new orders. Cancellation rates for
the year ended December 31, 2005 were approximately 13%, compared with 16% for the same
periods in 2004.



Homebuilding Segment Operations (continued)

Central:

For the year ended December 31, 2006, revenue from home settlements increased compared
with the same period in 2005. Higher average selling prices realized during 2006 were the
result of unit settlements in new communities in both Texas and Colorado. However, the
Central reporting segment recorded losses for both the fourth quarter and year ended December
31, 2006, compared with profits during the same period in 2005, which was largely attributable
to decreased home settlements. Net new orders for the fourth quarter of 2006 decreased 50% to
895 units, and for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased 28% to 5,437 units, compared
with the same periods in 2005. For the fourth quarter of 2006 cancellation rates were
approximately 38% compared with 31% for the same period in 2005, while cancellation rates for
the year ended December 31, 2006 were approximately 30% compared with 23% for the same period
in 2005. During 2006 and 2005, Central operating results were negatively impacted by
valuation adjustments to land inventory, net realizable value adjustments and write-offs of
deposits and pre-acquisition costs associated with transactions we no longer plan to pursue.
We recorded valuation adjustments to land inventory of $15.1 million and $3.1 million during
the fourth quarter of 2006 and 2005, respectively, and $23.9 million and $3.7 million during
the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We also recorded net realizable
value adjustments on land held for sale of $8.1 million and $2.5 million during the fourth
quarter of 2006 and 2005, respectively, and $27.7 million and $2.8 million during the years
ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. There were no significant land valuation and
net realizable adjustments or write-offs taken during the same periods in 2004.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, our Central operations realized increased revenues
primarily due to higher unit settlements, compared with the same period in 2004. During the
year ended December 31, 2005 average selling prices increased compared with the same period in
2004, and net new orders increased 36% to 7,549 units compared with the same period in 2004.
During the fourth quarter of 2005, net new orders increased 53% to 1,801 units compared with
the prior year period. During 2005, we realized increases in net new orders in Houston and
San Antonio as well as Denver, which experienced significant increases from the successful
grand opening of a large traditional/active adult community in November 2005. For the year
ended December 31, 2005, our Central operations were negatively impacted by a shift in product
mix as well as delays in the opening of certain new communities, compared with the prior year
period for 2004. Cancellation rates for the year ended December 31, 2005 were approximately
23%, compared with 29% for the same period in 2004. For the fourth quarter of 2005, the
cancellation rate was 31%, compared with 38% for the same period in 2004.

Southwest:

The Southwest operations continued to contribute positively to our Homebuilding operating
results, evidenced by increased revenues, unit settlements and higher average selling prices
compared with 2005. Net new orders for the fourth quarter of 2006 decreased 28% to 1,755
units, and for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased 22% to 8,365 units, compared with
the same periods in 2005. During 2006, reduced new order sign-up activity resulted in higher
cancellation rates. For the fourth quarter of 2006 cancellation rates were approximately 37%,
compared with 19% for the same period in 2005, while cancellation rates for the year ended
December 31, 2006 were approximately 35%, compared with 16% for the same period in 2005.
Operating results for the Southwest segment were positively impacted by our January 2006
acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in an entity that supplies and installs basic
building components and operating systems in both Arizona and Nevada. During 2005 and 2004,
income from this entity was recorded as equity income and had no impact on segment pre-tax
income. However, during the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, operating
results were negatively impacted by land valuation and net realizable adjustments and the
write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs. For the fourth quarter and year ended
December 31, 2006, we recorded land and community valuation adjustments for both periods of
$9.8 million, as well as net realizable value adjustments for land held for sale of $6.9
million and $7 million, respectively. During the fourth quarter and year ended December 31,
2006, we also recorded charges of $11.9 million and $21 million, respectively, for the
write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs associated with transactions we no longer plan
to pursue, primarily in the Phoenix and Tucson markets, which resulted in a reduction of lots
controlled of 7,600 and 21,200, respectively. There were no significant land valuation and net
realizable adjustments or write-offs taken during the same periods in 2005 and 2004.



Homebuilding Segment Operations (continued)

Southwest (continued):

During the year ended December 31, 2005, our Southwest operations contributed positively
to our Homebuilding operating results, evidenced by increased revenues and higher average
selling prices and profits compared with 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005, net new
orders increased 4% to 10,723 units compared with the same period in 2004. During the fourth
quarter of 2005, net new orders increased 33% to 2,447 units compared with the prior year
period. As of December 31, 2005, the decrease in Arizona’s active community count, compared
with the prior year, is attributable to the close-out of several communities, including a
large, established active adult community located in Phoenix. We opened two large active
adult communities, also located in Phoenix, during the first quarter of 2006 as replacement
communities. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we lowered pricing in Las Vegas to better align
pricing in our communities with pricing in the market. This action was in response to a
period of slow sign-ups and increased cancellation rates, which we attributed to our then
above-market pricing. After the price reductions took effect in the fourth quarter of 2004,
our communities in Las Vegas experienced improved traffic and new order activity during 2005.
Cancellation rates in the Southwest for the year ended December 31, 2005 were approximately
16%, which was comparable with the same period in 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2005,
cancellation rates were 19% compared with 34% during the same period in 2004.

California:

The California operations were impacted by weakened demand for new homes, evidenced by
increased resale inventories and pricing pressures, especially in Sacramento. During 2006,
these factors contributed to a decrease in net new orders, unit settlements and average
selling prices in California. Net new orders for the fourth quarter of 2006 decreased 13% to
940 units, and for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased 32% to 4,090 units, compared
with the same periods in 2005. During 2006, reduced new order sign-up activity resulted in
higher cancellation rates. For the fourth quarter of 2006 cancellation rates were
approximately 35% compared with 31% for the same period in 2005 while cancellation rates for
the year ended December 31, 2006 were approximately 36% compared with 24% for the same period
in 2005. California operating results were impacted during the fourth quarter and year ended
December 31, 2006 by valuation adjustments to land inventory of $37.5 million and $55.6
million, respectively, in addition to a $95.4 million land valuation adjustment recorded
during the fourth quarter of 2006 for two of our unconsolidated joint ventures located in
Sacramento. During the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, we also recorded
charges of $18.8 million and $33.1 million, respectively, for the write-off of deposits and
pre-acquisition costs associated with transactions we no longer plan to pursue primarily in
the Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay Area markets, which resulted in a reduction of lots
controlled of 9,200 and 19,300, respectively. There were no significant land valuation and
net realizable adjustments or write-offs taken during the same periods in 2005 and 2004.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, our California operations contributed positively
to our Homebuilding operating results, evidenced by increased revenues and higher average
selling prices and profits compared with 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005, net new
orders increased 14% to 6,041 units compared with the same period in 2004. For the fourth
quarter of 2005, net new orders decreased 6% to 1,083 units compared with the prior year
period. At December 31, 2005, unit backlog decreased 9% to 2,299 units compared with
December 31, 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2005, our California operations were impacted
by weakened demand for new homes evidenced by increased resale inventories and pricing
pressures, especially in Sacramento. In addition, the closeout of a large, successful active
adult community which contributed significantly to our operations impacted the California
reporting segment during the fourth quarter of 2005 and contributed to the decrease in net new
orders, unit settlements and average selling price during this period. Cancellation rates for
the year ended December 31, 2005 were approximately 24%, compared with 15% for the year ended
December 31, 2004.



Financial Services Operations

We conduct our financial services business, which includes mortgage and title operations,
through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries.

We originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various
credit arrangements, and then sell such mortgage loans monthly to outside investors. Also, we sell
our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts. Due to the
short period of time the servicing rights are held, we do not amortize the servicing asset. Since
the servicing rights are recorded based on the value in the servicing sales contracts, there are no
impairment issues related to these assets.

The following table presents mortgage origination data for our Financial Services operations:

Pre-tax income of our financial services operations was $115.5 million, $70.6 million, and
$47.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Mortgage origination unit volume decreased 6%, while mortgage origination principal volume
increased 2% for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease in unit volume is attributable to
lower home settlements in 2006 compared with 2005, offset by a higher capture rate in 2006 compared
with 2005, while the increase in origination principal volume is attributable to a higher average
loan size. For the year ended December 31, 2005, mortgage origination unit and principal volume
increased 22% and 27%, respectively, over 2004. This growth can be attributed to increases in the
capture rate of 140 basis points to 89.2% in 2005 combined with the volume increases experienced in
our homebuilding business and an increase in average loan size. Our capture rate represents loan
originations from our homebuilding business as a percent of total loan opportunities, excluding
cash settlements, from our homebuilding business. Our homebuilding customers continue to account
for the majority of total loan production, representing nearly 100% of Pulte Mortgage unit
production for 2006, compared with 98% in 2005 and 92% in 2004.

Adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) represented 28% of total funded origination dollars and 22%
of total funded origination units for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with 45% and 39%,
respectively, in 2005 and 43% and 42%, respectively, in 2004. Interest only mortgages, a component
of ARMs, represented 79% of ARMs origination dollars and 81% of ARMs origination units for the year
ended December 31, 2006, compared with 65% and 56% in 2005, and 42% and 30%, respectively, in 2004.
Interest only mortgages represented 22%, 29%, and 18%, respectively, of total funded origination
dollars for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004.

Refinancings represented 1% of total loan production in 2006 and 2005, compared with 3% in
2004. Our customers’ average FICO scores for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004
were 743, 741, and 737, respectively. Combined Loan-to-Value was 82% for the year ended December
31, 2006, and 81% for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. At December 31,
2006, loan application backlog was $2.1 billion, compared with $4.2 billion and $3.5 billion at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Pre-tax income increased 64% for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with 2005,
primarily due to the sale of our investment in Su Casita, a Mexico-based mortgage banking company.
As a result of this transaction, we recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $31.6 million ($20.1
million after-tax). Excluding this gain, pre-tax income increased 19% in 2006 compared with 2005,
due to the combination of increased origination principal volume and a shift in product mix to more
profitable loans. In 2006, 21% of total origination dollars were from brokered loans, which are
less profitable to us, compared with 26% in 2005. Mortgage origination fees of $15.5 million in
2006 were $5.2 million, or 25%, lower than the $20.7 million recorded for the same period in 2005.
The 25% decrease over the same period in 2005 is due to a shift in product mix towards funded
production.

Pre-tax income increased 49% for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with 2004, due to
increased volume and a favorable product mix shift to funded, from non-funded originations. In
2005, 26% of total origination dollars were from brokered loans, which are less profitable to us,
compared with 36% in 2004. Mortgage origination fees of $20.7 million in 2005 were $0.2 million,
or 1%, higher than the $20.5 million recorded for the same period in 2004. The 1% increase over the
same period in 2004 is due to higher revenues per loan as brokered origination volume decreased 7%
in 2005 when compared with 2004.



Financial Services Operations (continued)

The net gain from sale of mortgages of $110.8 million in 2006 was $29.7 million, or 37%,
higher than the $81.1 million recorded for the same period in 2005. This favorable variance was
due primarily to an increase in loans available for sale combined with a favorable shift in product
mix in 2006 when compared to 2005. Net interest income in 2006 was $9.8 million, or 2%, lower than
the $10 million for the same period in 2005. The decrease was primarily due to a lower net
interest margin partially offset by higher funded origination volume. Income from our title
operations was $20 million in 2006, a decrease of 10% over 2005, due primarily to a decrease in the
number of homes closed in 2006 compared to 2005. Selling, general and administrative expense
increased $10.2 million, or 13%, from 2005, due primarily to higher operating expenses.

Our minority interest in Su Casita, a Mexican mortgage banking company, contributed income
from operations of approximately $350 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2005. During
February 2005, 25% of our investment in the capital stock of Su Casita was redeemed for a gain of
approximately $620 thousand. Our remaining interest of 16.66% was accounted for under the cost
method of accounting and therefore no income was recorded for periods subsequent to the sale.
Income from Su Casita for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $4 million. In February 2006, we
completed the sale of our remaining investment in Su Casita for approximately $50 million, and
realized a pre-tax gain of approximately $31.6 million related to the transaction.

We hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with
derivative financial instruments. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not recognize any
material net gains or losses related to an ineffective portion of the hedging instrument. We also
did not recognize any material net gains or losses during 2005 for cash flow hedges that were
discontinued because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur. At
December 31, 2006, we expect to reclassify $978 thousand, net of taxes, of net gains on derivative
instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months
as sales of mortgage backed securities occur.



Other non-operating

Other non-operating expenses, net consists of income and expenses related to corporate
services provided to our subsidiaries. These expenses are incurred for financing, developing and
implementing strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating
efficiencies, and providing the necessary administrative support associated with being a publicly
traded entity listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Accordingly, these results will vary from
year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve.

Net interest expense was $531 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with
approximately $43.3 million and $47.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. These variances are the result of an increase in the amount of interest capitalized
into homebuilding inventory.

Changes in other expenses, net for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, compared with
prior years were primarily due to changes in compensation-related costs. Additionally, during 2004
we recognized income from the sale and adjustment to fair value of various non-operating parcels of
commercial land held for sale.

Interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory is charged to home cost of sales based on the
cyclical timing of our unit settlements over a period that approximates the average life cycle of
our communities. During 2006 and 2005, interest in homebuilding inventory increased compared with
the prior years due to increased amounts of interest capitalized based on our homebuilding
inventory and debt levels. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2006, $16 million of
capitalized interest related to inventory impairment write-offs was expensed. Information related
to corporate interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory is as follows ($000’s omitted):

Discontinued Operations

First Heights

— In September 2003, the United States Court of Federal Claims issued
final judgment that Pulte Homes, Inc., Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc. and First Heights
(collectively, the Pulte Parties) had been damaged by approximately $48.7 million as a result of
the United States government’s breach of contract with them. The final judgment follows the
Court’s August 17, 2001 ruling that the United States breached the contract related to the Pulte
Parties’ 1988 acquisition of five savings and loan associations by enacting Section 13224 of the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. The United States government and the Pulte Parties filed
Notices of Appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in October 2003.

In August 2005, the United States Court of Appeals affirmed the United States Court of Federal
Claims’ judgment, in its entirety, that we had been damaged by approximately $48.7 million as a
result of the United States government’s breach of contract in connection with the enactment of
Section 13224 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. In December 2005, we received
payment of the judgment in the amount of $48.7 million, which was recorded as income from
discontinued operations.

In September 2005, First Heights received notice confirming the voluntary dissolution of the
First Heights Bank. The Office of Thrift Supervision also canceled First Heights’ charter.
Accordingly, the day-to-day activities of First Heights, which had been principally devoted to
supporting residual regulatory compliance matters and the litigation with the United States
government, have now ceased.

W e also recorded non-cash, after-tax gains of $7.8 million and $10.8 million, during the
third quarter of 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to the favorable resolution of certain tax
matters relating to our former thrift operation, which was discontinued in 1994.

Mexico

— In January 2005, the minority shareholders of Pulte Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V.
(“Pulte Mexico”) exercised a put option under the terms of a reorganization agreement dated as of
December 31, 2001, to sell their shares to us, the consummation of which resulted in our owning
100% of Pulte Mexico. In March 2005, we purchased 60% of the minority interest of Pulte Mexico for
approximately $18.7 million in cash. In June 2005, we purchased the remaining 40% of the minority
interest of Pulte Mexico for approximately $12.5 million in cash. We assigned approximately $17.6
million of the purchase price premium to house and land inventory, which was amortized through cost
of sales as homes were sold. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of
the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed, of $5.3 million, was recorded as goodwill.

In December 2005, we sold substantially all of our Mexico homebuilding operations to a
consortium of purchasers involved in residential and commercial real estate development. The
disposition of the Mexico homebuilding operations will allow us to invest additional resources in
the U.S. housing market. We realized cash of $131.5 million related to the sale. The sale of
these operations did not include our investment in the capital stock of a mortgage company in
Mexico as well as various non-operating entities, which are not considered to be material to our
results of operations or our financial position.

Revenues of these discontinued operations were $201 million and $185.8 million for the years
ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
discontinued Mexico homebuilding operations reported total after-tax income (losses) of ($1.5)
million and $4.4 million, respectively. Results of Mexico homebuilding operations, for the years
ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, resulted in pre-tax operating income of $4.6 million and $8.2
million, respectively.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized a pre-tax loss of $6.6 million (after-tax
loss of $13.1 million) related to the sale of our Mexico homebuilding operations. The pre-tax loss
on sale includes the accounting recognition of the economic losses related to accumulated foreign
currency translation adjustments of $7.6 million, which had previously been reported in other
comprehensive income, as well as the write-off of $5.3 million of goodwill related to the 2005
acquisition of the minority shareholder interests. At December 31, 2005, the Mexico homebuilding
operations have been presented as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements,
while previously they were included in our Homebuilding operations. Certain amounts previously
reported in the 2004 financial statements and notes thereto were reclassified to conform to the
2005 presentation.

Concurrent with the sale of the Mexico homebuilding operations, we elected to repatriate all
of our earnings from our Mexico operations in accordance with the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004 (Internal Revenue Code Section 965, Temporary Dividends Received Deduction) and recorded $4.8
million of related income taxes, which have been included in the Mexico loss on sale from
discontinued operations.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, loss from discontinued operations included a provision
of $2.3 million, net of taxes, which resulted from a contractual adjustment related to the December
2005 disposition of the our Mexico homebuilding operations.



Discontinued Operations (continued)

Argentina

— In January 2005, we sold all of our Argentina operations to an Argentine
company involved in residential and commercial real estate development. The disposition of these
operations was intended to improve our overall returns. At December 31, 2004, the Argentina
operations were classified as held for sale and presented as discontinued operations in our
Consolidated Financial Statements, while previously they were included in our Homebuilding
operations.

Revenues of these discontinued Argentine operations were $24.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2004 discontinued Argentine operations reported
total after-tax losses of $22 million. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Argentina
operations reported after-tax operating losses of $1.4 million. In addition, we recognized a
pre-tax loss of $33.2 million ($20.6 million after-tax) on the write-down of the Argentina
operations to fair value less costs to sell. The pre-tax loss includes the accounting recognition
of the economic losses related to accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments of $25.1
million ($15.6 million after-tax), which had previously been reported in other comprehensive
income.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, loss from discontinued operations included a provision
of $111 thousand, net of taxes, which resulted from a contractual adjustment related to the January
2005 disposition of our Argentine operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We finance our homebuilding land acquisition, development and construction activities by using
internally generated funds and existing credit arrangements. We routinely monitor current
operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate the use of available financing
sources, including securities offerings.

At December 31, 2006, we had cash and equivalents of $551.3 million and $3.5 billion of senior
notes outstanding. Other financing included non-recourse collateralized financing totaling $26.9
million. Sources of our working capital include our cash and equivalents, our $2.01 billion
committed unsecured revolving credit facility and Pulte Mortgage’s $955 million committed credit
arrangements and other uncommitted borrowing arrangements.

Our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization, excluding our collateralized debt related to
financial services, was approximately 35% at December 31, 2006, and approximately 31.2% net of cash
and equivalents.

Pulte Mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds
and borrowings made available pursuant to various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements.
At December 31, 2006, Pulte Mortgage had committed credit arrangements of $955 million, comprised
of a $405 million bank revolving credit facility and a $550 million asset-backed commercial paper
program. In May 2006, Pulte Mortgage amended its revolving credit facility, which included
amendments to its restrictive covenants. In August 2006, Pulte Mortgage amended the bank credit
agreement related to its asset-backed commercial paper program, which also included amendments to
its restrictive covenants. Both amended credit agreements now require Pulte Mortgage to maintain a
consolidated tangible net worth of at least $50 million or eighty-five percent of the average
month-end tangible net worth for the last twelve months of the preceding calendar year and funded
debt cannot exceed 15 times tangible net worth.

Our income tax liability and related effective tax rate are affected by a number of factors.
In 2006, our effective tax rate was 36.3% compared with 36.9% in 2005 and 37.6% in 2004. The
reduction in the effective tax rate for 2006 was primarily due to an adjustment for the Section 199
manufacturing deduction, a change in the overall state tax rate associated with the geographical
mix in income and certain other tax matters. The reduction in the effective tax rate for 2005 was
principally due to the Section 199 manufacturing deduction established by the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2007 will be approximately
37%.

Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to
$267.5 million, while net cash provided by operating activities was $18.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2004, net cash used in operating
activities was $692.2 million. In 2006, decreased net income and an increase in deferred income
taxes were offset by the write-down of land and deposits and pre-acquisition costs of $409.5
million. In 2005 and 2004, increased net income was offset primarily by significant investments in
land inventory.



Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)

Cash used in investing activities was $86.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
compared with $25.3 million and $198.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. We invested approximately $65.8 million, net of cash acquired, to purchase the
remaining 50% of an entity that installs basic building components and operating systems. In
addition, we received cash of $49.2 million for the sale of our investment in Su Casita, a
Mexico-based mortgage banking company. Also, we made $58.2 million of capital contributions to and
received $67.4 million in capital distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures for the year
ended December 31, 2006. Further we incurred approximately $98.6 million in capital expenditures
to support the growth of our business.

The change in net cash used in investing activities from 2004 to 2005 primarily relates to
proceeds from the sale of subsidiaries during 2005 of $142.9 million, increases in distributions
from unconsolidated entities of $41.9 million, offset by increases in capital expenditures of $13.7
million. During 2005, we invested approximately $37.3 million in three new joint ventures that
develop and/or sell land within the United States. Also, we contributed $124.6 million of
additional capital contributions to and received $108 million in capital distributions from our
unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2005. Further, we incurred
approximately $88.9 million in capital expenditures to support the growth of our business. During
January 2004, we invested $35 million for a 50% ownership in an entity that supplies and installs
basic building components and operating systems. During 2004, we invested approximately $117.8
million in new joint ventures that develop and/or sell land in the United States. Also, we
contributed $44.2 million of additional capital contributions to and received $66.1 million in
capital distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Net cash used in financing activities totaled $96.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2006. Cash inflows from financing activities are primarily attributed to the issuance of $150
million, 7.375% senior notes and $8.4 million from the issuance of common stock. Cash outflows
from financing activities are primarily attributed to $78.3 million repayment of Pulte Mortgage’s
collateralized short term debt, $19.8 million payment of non-recourse collateralized financing,
$122.3 million used to repurchase our common stock, and $40.9 million of cash dividends paid to
shareholders.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $700.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2005. Cash inflows from financing activities are primarily attributed to proceeds from our $350
million, 5.2% senior notes and $300 million, 6% senior notes issued in February 2005, proceeds from
Pulte Mortgage’s line of credit of approximately $275.6 million, proceeds from non-recourse
collateralized financing arrangements of approximately $46.8 million, and proceeds from the
exercise of stock options of $31.2 million. Cash outflows from financing activities for the year
ended December 31, 2005 primarily relate to the repayment of our $125 million, 7.3% senior notes in
October 2005, approximately $33.6 million of cash dividends paid to our shareholders, and $143.2
million used to repurchase our common stock.

Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $809.6 million for the year ended December
31, 2004. Cash inflows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 are primarily
attributed to proceeds received from our $500 million, 5.25% senior notes issued in January 2004
and our $400 million, 4.875% senior notes issued in July 2004 and $44 million of cash received from
the exercise of stock options. Cash outflows from financing activities for the year ended December
31, 2004 primarily relate to the repayment of our $112 million, 8.375% senior notes in August 2004,
redemption of the remaining $77 million of Del Webb 10.25% senior subordinated notes in February
2004, approximately $25.4 million of cash dividends paid to our shareholders, $44.9 million used to
repay borrowings, and $14.7 million used to repurchase our common stock.

In May 2006, we sold $150 million of 7.375% senior notes, which mature on June 1, 2046, which
are guaranteed by us and certain of our 100%-owned subsidiaries. These notes are unsecured and
rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The notes are
redeemable at any time on or after June 1, 2011, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date.
Proceeds from the sale were used to repay the indebtedness of our revolving credit facility and for
general corporate purposes, including continued investment in our business.

In August 2006, we increased the borrowing availability under our 4-year unsecured revolving
credit facility from $1.66 billion to $2.01 billion. The credit facility includes an uncommitted
accordion feature, under which the credit facility may be increased to $2.25 billion. We have the
capacity to issue letters of credit up to $1.125 billion. Borrowing availability is reduced by the
amount of letters of credit outstanding. The credit facility contains restrictive covenants, the
most restrictive of which requires us not to exceed a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 60% and
also requires us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2:1 (EBITDA to interest
incurred), as defined in the agreement. As of December 31, 2006, we had no borrowings outstanding
and $1.45 billion available for borrowing under this facility.

Pursuant to the two $100 million stock repurchase programs authorized by our Board of
Directors in October 2002 and 2005, and the $200 million stock repurchase authorization in February
2006 (for a total stock repurchase authorization of $400 million), we have repurchased a total of
9,688,900 shares for a total of $297.7 million. At December 31, 2006, we had remaining
authorization to purchase $102.3 million of common stock.



Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)

Inflation

We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high
inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation also increases our financing,
labor and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the
affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass to our
customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices.

We are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts
(including option contracts) for the purchase, development and sale of real estate in the routine
conduct of our business. Option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring
portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we are ready to
build homes on them. This reduces our financial risks associated with long-term land holdings. At
December 31, 2006, we had agreements to acquire approximately 71,800 homesites through option
contracts and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At December 31, 2006, we had
$369.5 million of non-refundable option deposits and advanced costs related to certain of these
agreements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We use standby letters of credit and performance bonds to guarantee our performance under
various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our projects. The expiration
dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related
homebuilding projects. If the obligations related to a project are ongoing, annual extensions of
the letters of credit are typically granted on a year-to-year basis. At December 31, 2006, we had
outstanding letters of credit of $591.2 million. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration
dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These
bonds, which approximated $1.8 billion at December 31, 2006, are typically outstanding over a
period of approximately 3-5 years. We do not believe that we will be required to draw upon any
such letters of credit or performance bonds.

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land option or option type agreements in
order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future. At December 31, 2006, these
agreements totaled approximately $4.3 billion. Pursuant to these land option agreements, we
provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times
in the future, usually at predetermined prices. If the entity holding the land under option is a
variable interest entity, our deposit represents a variable interest in that entity. At December
31, 2006, we consolidated certain variable interest entities with assets totaling $43.6 million.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures was
$935.9 million and $882.2 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, our proportionate
share of joint venture debt was approximately $312.8 million and $297.9 million, respectively. At
December 31, 2006 and 2005, we provided non-recourse debt guarantees for $304.1 million and $293.4
million, respectively, of joint venture debt. Accordingly, we may be liable, on a contingent
basis, through limited guarantees with respect to a portion of the secured land acquisition and
development debt. However, we would not be liable other than in instances of fraud,
misrepresentation or other bad faith actions by us, unless the joint venture was unable to perform
its contractual borrowing obligations. As of December 31, 2006, we do not anticipate that we will
incur any significant costs under these guarantees that have not already been recognized in our
impairment analysis, as further discussed in Note 4 of our Consolidated Financial Statements.

For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we recognized equity income (loss) from
our unconsolidated joint ventures of $(62.9) million, $75.4 million and $60.1 million,
respectively. The equity loss recognized during the year ended December 31, 2006 includes land
valuation adjustments of $95.4 million, which relate to two of our joint ventures located in
Sacramento, California. In accordance with their debt guarantees, these joint ventures are
required to maintain a certain ratio of value of the collateral (generally land and improvements)
as a specified percentage of the loan balance. If we are required to make a payment to bring the
loan balance below the specified percentage of the loan balance, the payment would constitute a
capital contribution or loan to the unconsolidated entity and increase our share of any funds the
unconsolidated entity distributes, if they are available. The land valuation adjustments recorded
during 2006 include all significant costs expected at this time under such guarantees.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with United
States generally accepted accounting principles. When more than one accounting principle, or the
method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is
appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements).
Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future
resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these
estimates. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, we have made our best estimates
and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements,
giving due regard to materiality.

Revenue recognition

Homebuilding

— Homebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized at the
time of the closing of the sale, when title to and possession of the property are transferred to
the buyer. In situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by Pulte Mortgage, our
wholly-owned mortgage subsidiary, and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing
investment as required by SFAS No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate,” the profit on such
sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a third-party investor has been
completed.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)

Financial
Services

— Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans
for various investors. Servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding
principal balance, or a contracted set fee in the case of certain sub-servicing, and are credited
to income when related mortgage payments are received. Loan origination fees, commitment fees and
certain direct loan origination costs are deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the related
mortgage loan until such loan is sold. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are
recognized when the loans are sold. Interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is
originated until the loan is sold. Loans are placed on non-accrual status once they become greater
than 90 days past due their contractual terms. Subsequent payments received are applied according
to the contractual terms of the loan.

Inventory valuation

Our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated costs or net realizable value.
Included in inventories are all direct development costs. Inventories under development or held
for development are stated at accumulated cost, unless they are determined to be impaired, in which
case these inventories are measured at fair value. If actual market conditions are less favorable
than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments may be required. In
accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets,” we
record valuation adjustments on land inventory and related communities under development when
events and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired and when the cash flows estimated to be
generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. Additionally, we also value
long-lived assets for sale at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories. Interest capitalized each quarter
is identified as a separate layer in our capitalized interest balance sheet pool. Each layer of
capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities
under development. Interest expense is allocated to the quarters over the amortization period based
on the cyclical timing of unit settlements.

Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis. Under the specific identification
basis, cost of sales includes the construction cost of the home, an average lot cost by project
based on land acquisition and development costs, and closing costs and commissions. Construction
cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home, plus an accrual for
costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost. This accrual
is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared to the amount
accrued, and adjustments are made if needed. Total project land acquisition and development costs
are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared to actual costs incurred to date and estimates
to complete. Adjustments to estimated total project land acquisition and development costs for the
project affect the amount of future lots costed prospectively.

Residential mortgage loans available-for-sale

Residential mortgage loans available-for-sale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or
market value. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are
sold. We hedge our residential mortgage loans available-for-sale. Gains and losses from closed
commitments and futures contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on the sale of
mortgage loans.

An allowance for credit losses is established when specific loans are identified as probable
of foreclosure and loss. Additionally, an allowance is provided based on historical losses applied
against the most recent quarter of funded production.

Goodwill and intangible assets

We have recorded certain intangible assets and goodwill, most of which relate to the Del Webb
merger in 2001. Intangible assets, primarily trademarks and tradenames, were valued using proven
valuation procedures and are amortized over their estimated useful life. Goodwill is subject to
annual impairment testing. The carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is
dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use.
If our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly, intangible assets and
goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material. If we determine
that the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the
existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we measure impairment based on several accepted
valuation methods. For assets related to ongoing operations, we use a projected undiscounted cash
flow method to determine if impairment exists and then measure impairment using discounted cash
flows. For assets to be disposed of, we assess the fair value of the asset based on current market
conditions for similar assets. For goodwill, we assess fair value by measuring discounted cash
flows of our reporting units and measure impairment as the difference between the resulting implied
fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value.

The estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments
regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control. Changes in these
estimates could result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and material
charges to the results of operations.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)

Allowance for warranties

Home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building defects. The specific
terms and conditions of those warranties vary geographically. Most warranties cover different
aspects of the home’s construction and operating systems for a period of up to ten years. We
estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of
such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability
include the number of homes sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per
claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts
as necessary. Although we have not made significant adjustments to the accrual in the past, actual
warranty cost in the future could differ from our current estimate.

Insurance

We have, and require the majority of our subcontractors to have, general liability, property,
errors and omissions, workers compensation and other business insurance. These insurance policies
protect us against a portion of the risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self-insured
retentions, deductibles, and other coverage limits. Through our captive insurance subsidiaries, we
reserve for costs to cover our self-insured and deductible amounts under those policies and for any
costs of claims and lawsuits, based on an analysis of our historical claims, which include an
estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported.

As of January 1, 2006, we are also self-insured for certain of our medical and dental claims
and reserve for costs to cover our liability for such claims, based on analysis of historical
claims, which include an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported.

Stock-based compensation

The Company currently has several stock-based compensation plans for its employees (“Employee
Plans”) and nonemployee directors (the “Director Plan”). The Employee Plans primarily provide for
the grant of options (both non-qualified options and incentive stock options as defined in each
respective plan), stock appreciation rights and restricted stock to key employees of the Company or
its subsidiaries (as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors) for
periods not exceeding ten years. Options granted under the Employee Plans vest incrementally in
periods ranging from six months to four years. Under the Director Plan, nonemployee directors are
entitled to an annual distribution of 3,600 shares of common stock and options to purchase an
additional 7,000 shares. All options granted under the Director Plan are non-qualified, vest
immediately and are exercisable on the date of grant. Options granted under the Director Plan are
exercisable for ten years from the grant date.

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), “Share Based Payments,” which is
a revision of SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and amends SFAS Statement No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.” We calculate the fair
value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Determining the fair value of
share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions, which involve a
number of variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price
volatility over the term of the awards, the expected dividend yield and expected stock option
exercise behavior. In addition, we also use judgment in estimating the number of share-based awards
that are expected to be forfeited. The Company adopted SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective
method of transition. Accordingly, prior periods have not been restated. The adoption of SFAS
123(R) did not have a significant effect on basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended
December 31, 2006.

Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for its stock-based awards under the fair
value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” The
Company selected the prospective method of adoption as permitted by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure.” Under the prospective method, the Company
recognized compensation expense on an accelerated basis over the vesting period based on the fair
value provisions of SFAS No. 123.

Pulte Mortgage, operating as a mortgage banker, is also subject to interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed-upon terms (i.e.,
commit to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk
continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2006 and
2005, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising
interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an
interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float.

We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing
agreement tied to LIBOR and A1/P1 commercial paper rates and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and
closed loans through derivative financial instruments. These financial instruments include cash
forward placement contracts on mortgage-backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options
on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage-backed
securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate
parallel shifts in long-term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100 and 150 basis points would not be
material to our financial results.

At December 31, 2006, our aggregate net investment exposed to foreign currency exchange rate
risk includes our remaining non-operating investments in Mexico, which approximated $3.5 million.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Summary of significant accounting policies

Basis of presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pulte Homes, Inc., all of its
direct and indirect subsidiaries (the “Company”) and variable interest entities in which the
Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The direct subsidiaries of Pulte Homes, Inc.
include Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc., Del Webb Corporation (“Del Webb”) and other
subsidiaries that are engaged in the homebuilding business. Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc.’s
operating subsidiaries include Pulte Home Corporation, Pulte International Corporation
(“International”) and other subsidiaries that are engaged in the homebuilding business. Pulte
Diversified Companies, Inc.’s former thrift subsidiary, First Heights Holding Corp, LLC (“First
Heights”), is classified as a discontinued operation (See Note 3). The Company also has a
mortgage banking company, Pulte Mortgage LLC (“Pulte Mortgage”), which is a subsidiary of Pulte
Home Corporation.

In December 2005, the Company sold substantially all of its Mexico homebuilding operations,
realizing cash of $131.5 million as further described in Note 3. For the years ended December
31, 2005 and 2004, the Mexico operations have been presented as discontinued operations in the
Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

In January 2005, the Company sold all of its Argentina operations, as further described in
Note 3. At December 31, 2004, the Argentina operations were classified as held for sale. For
the year ended December 31, 2004, the Argentina operations have been presented as discontinued
operations in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

Foreign currency

The financial statements of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries in Argentina and Mexico were
measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these
subsidiaries were translated at exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Revenues and
expenses were translated at average exchange rates in effect during the year. Cumulative
translation adjustments of $7.6 million for the Company’s Mexico homebuilding operations were
recognized in December 2005 in connection with the sale of those operations. Realized foreign
currency transaction gains and losses have been included in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Realized foreign currency transaction (gains) losses were not significant during
the year ended December 31, 2006. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, realized
foreign currency transaction (gains) losses were $(1.6) million and $300 thousand, respectively,
which were recorded in income from discontinued operations.

Cash and equivalents

For purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, commercial paper and time
deposits with a maturity of three months or less when acquired are classified as cash
equivalents. Additionally, the Company holds cash that is restricted as to its use. Restricted
cash primarily consists of customer deposits on home sales which are temporarily restricted by
regulatory requirements until title transfers to the homebuyer. At December 31, 2006 and 2005,
the balance of restricted cash was $17.3 million and $33.1 million, respectively.



PULTE HOMES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

1. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Investments in unconsolidated entities

The equity method of accounting is used for joint ventures and associated entities over
which the Company has significant influence; generally this represents partnership equity or
common stock ownership interests of at least 20% and not more than 50% (See Note 4). Under the
equity method of accounting, the Company recognizes its pro rata share of the profits and losses
of these entities. Certain of these entities sell lots and provide construction services to the
Company. Profits from such activities are deferred by the Company until the time the related
homes are sold.

The cost method of accounting is used for investments in which the Company has less than a
20% ownership interest and does not have the ability to exercise significant influence.

Goodwill

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the majority of goodwill, which represents the cost of
acquired companies in excess of the fair value of the net assets at the acquisition date,
resulted from the acquisition of Del Webb in 2001. During 2006, the Company recorded $68
million of additional goodwill in connection with its January 2006 acquisition of an entity that
supplies and installs basic building components and operating systems. All goodwill relates to
the Company’s Homebuilding operations, except for $700 thousand, which relates to the Financial
Services segment. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No.
142, annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not
be recoverable, management evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by comparing the carrying
value of the Company’s reporting units to their fair value. Fair value is determined based on
discounted future cash flows. The Company performed its annual impairment test during the
fourth quarter of 2006 and determined there to be no impairment of goodwill.

Intangible assets

Intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks and tradenames acquired in connection
with the 2001 acquisition of Del Webb and are included in the assets of the Company’s
Homebuilding operations. These intangible assets were valued at the acquisition date utilizing
proven valuation procedures and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a 20-year
life. The acquired cost and accumulated amortization of the Company’s intangible assets were
$163.5 million and $44.5 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006, and $163.5 million and
$36.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005. Amortization expense was $8.2 million for
each of the respective years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 and $8.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004. Amortization expense for trademarks and tradenames is expected to be
approximately $8.2 million in each of the next 5 years.

Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators exist, an
assessment of undiscounted future cash flows for the assets related to these intangibles is
evaluated accordingly. If the results of the analysis indicate impairment, the assets are
adjusted to fair market value. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, there
were no impairments of intangible assets.

Fixed assets and depreciation

Fixed assets are recorded at cost. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to earnings as
incurred. Depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method based upon estimated
useful lives as follows: Vehicles, three to seven years, model and office furniture, two to
three years, and equipment, three to ten years. Fixed assets are included in Other Assets and
totaled $164.7 million net of accumulated depreciation of $180.2 million at December 31, 2006
and $153.6 million net of accumulated depreciation of $130.2 million at December 31, 2005.
Total depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $75.4
million, $53.3 million and $38 million, respectively.

1. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Advertising cost

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2006,
2005 and 2004, the Company incurred advertising costs of approximately $106 million, $94.1
million and $87.1 million, respectively.

Employee benefits

The Company maintains one defined contribution plan that covers substantially all of the
Company’s employees. Company contributions to the plan are expensed as paid. The total Company
contributions pursuant to the plan were approximately $23.5 million, $19.8 million and $15
million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Insurance

The Company has, and requires the majority of its subcontractors to have, general
liability, property, errors and omissions, workers compensation and other business insurance.
These insurance policies protect the Company against a portion of its risk of loss from claims,
subject to certain self-insured retentions, deductibles, and other coverage limits. Through its
captive insurance subsidiaries, the Company reserves for costs to cover its self-insured and
deductible amounts under those policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits, based on an
analysis of the Company’s historical claims, which includes an estimate of claims incurred but
not yet reported. The Company’s total reserves for such items were $215.7 million and $141.3
million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Expenses related to such claims were
approximately $89.1 million, $64.4 million, and $52.9 million for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

As of January 1, 2006, the Company is self-insured for certain of its medical and dental
claims and reserves for costs to cover its liability for such claims, based on analysis of
historical claims, which include an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. The
Company’s total reserves for such items were $6.3 million at December 31, 2006.

Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders
(the “numerator”) by the weighted-average number of common shares, adjusted for nonvested shares
of restricted stock (the “denominator”) for the period. Computing diluted earnings per share is
similar to computing basic earnings per share, except that the denominator is increased to
include the dilutive effects of options and nonvested shares of restricted stock. Any options
that have an exercise price greater than the average market price are considered to be
anti-dilutive, and are excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation. For the years
ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company had 4,707,900, 161,109 and 129,390
anti-dilutive outstanding stock options, respectively, which were excluded from this
calculation.

Fair values of financial instruments

The carrying amounts of cash and equivalents approximate their fair values due to their
short-term nature.

The fair value of residential mortgage loans available-for-sale is estimated using the
quoted market prices for securities backed by similar loans. Fair value exceeded cost by
approximately $7.3 million and $10.8 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Carrying amounts for financial derivative instruments reported in the balance sheet
approximate fair value as the amounts reported are based on current market prices. The
estimated fair values of financial instruments were determined by management using available
market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is necessary
to interpret the market data and develop the estimated fair value. Accordingly, the estimates
presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize on disposition
of the financial instruments. Changes in the fair value of these instruments would not have a
significant impact on the Company’s results of operations. The use of different market
assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair
value amounts. At December 31, 2006, derivative assets, included in other assets in the balance
sheet, totaled $5.2 million and derivative liabilities, included in accrued and other
liabilities, totaled $3.2 million. At December 31, 2005, derivative assets totaled $5.3 million
and derivative liabilities totaled $7.5 million.



PULTE HOMES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

1. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Fair values of financial instruments (continued)

The fair values of senior notes are based on quoted market prices, when available. If
quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of similar
issues.

Disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments are based on pertinent
information available to management as of December 31, 2006. Although management is not aware
of any factors that would significantly affect the reasonableness of the fair value amounts,
such amounts were not comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since
that date and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts
presented herein.

Stock-based compensation

The Company currently has several stock-based compensation plans for its employees
(“Employee Plans”) and nonemployee directors (the “Director Plan”). At December 31, 2006, the
Company had 34 million shares authorized for issuing various equity-based incentives including
stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock, including 8.6 million shares
available for future grants.

Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for its stock-based awards under the fair
value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” The
Company selected the prospective method of adoption as permitted by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure.” Under the prospective method, the
Company recognized compensation expense on an accelerated basis over the vesting period based on
the fair value provisions of SFAS No. 123.

As of January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), “Share Based Payments,” which
is a revision of SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and amends SFAS Statement No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.” The Company adopted
SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective method of transition. Accordingly, prior periods
have not been restated. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) did not have a significant effect on basic
and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company presented all benefits of the tax
deductions resulting from the exercise of share-based compensation as operating cash flows in
its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. SFAS 123(R) requires classification of the benefits
of tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options (excess tax
benefits) as financing cash flows. As a result, the Company classified $6.7 million of excess
tax benefits as financing cash inflows for the year ended December 31, 2006.

The Company also recorded compensation expense for restricted stock awards, net of related
tax effects, of $13.3 million and $4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. These amounts have been excluded from the reconciliation above, as they would
have no impact on pro forma net income presented.

The Company measures compensation cost for its stock options at fair value on the date of
grant and recognizes compensation cost on the graded vesting method over the vesting period,
generally four years. The graded vesting method provides for vesting of portions of the overall
awards at interim dates and results in greater expense in earlier years than the straight-line
method. The fair value of the Company’s stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes
valuation model. The fair value of restricted stock is determined based on the number of shares
granted and the quoted price of the Company’s common stock. Compensation expense related to the
Company’s share-based awards is generally included in selling, general and administrative
expense within the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company’s stock option participant agreements provide continued vesting for certain
eligible employees who have achieved a predetermined level of service based on their combined
age and years of service. For awards granted prior to January 1, 2006, the Company recognized
the related compensation cost ratably over the nominal vesting period. For awards granted after
the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company now records related compensation cost over the
period through the date the employee first achieves the minimum level of service that would no
longer require them to provide services to earn the award. For the year ended December 31,
2006, the Company recorded $4.8 million of compensation expense related to stock option grants
made to employees that have achieved this level of service, as well as those who will achieve
this level of service during the vesting period.

New accounting pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted
accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007,
and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the effect
of SFAS No. 157 on its consolidated financial statements.

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 48,
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes” (FIN 48), to create a single model to address accounting for
uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes, by
prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being
recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,
measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2006. The Company will adopt FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007, as required. The cumulative
effect of adopting FIN 48 will be recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of
retained earnings and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial
position. The adoption of FIN 48 may cause greater volatility in the effective tax rate
going forward.

In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, “Accounting for Servicing of Financial
Assets,” which provides an approach to simplify efforts to obtain hedge-like (offset)
accounting. This new Statement amends SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing
of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities,” with respect to the accounting for
separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. SFAS No. 156 is effective
for all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities as of the beginning of an
entity’s fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006, with earlier adoption permitted in
certain circumstances. Due to the short period of time the Company’s servicing rights are
held, the Company does not expect SFAS No. 156 will have a significant impact on its
consolidated financial statements.

The FASB has revised its guidance on SFAS No. 133 Implementation Issues as of March
2006. Several Implementation Issues were revised to reflect the issuance of SFAS No. 155,
“Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments – an Amendment of FASB Statements No.
133 and 140,” in February 2006. SFAS No. 155 allows any hybrid financial instrument that
contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation under SFAS No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to be carried at fair value in
its entirety, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. In addition, SFAS No. 155
requires that beneficial interests in securitized financial assets be analyzed to determine
whether they are freestanding derivatives or contain an embedded derivative. SFAS No. 155
also eliminates a prior restriction on the types of passive derivatives that a qualifying
special purpose entity is permitted to hold. SFAS No. 155 is applicable to new or modified
financial instruments in fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006, though the
provisions related to fair value accounting for hybrid financial instruments can also be
applied to existing instruments. The Company does not expect SFAS No. 155 will have a
significant effect on its consolidated financial statements.

Homebuilding

Land Valuation Adjustments and Write-Offs

Impairment of long-lived assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived
Assets,” the Company records valuation adjustments on land inventory and related communities
under development when events and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired and when the
cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. The
Company records these valuation adjustments in its Consolidated Statements of Operations within
Homebuilding expense, which includes home cost of sales. During 2006, as a result of changing
market conditions which included an industry-wide weakening of demand for new homes, a portion
of the Company’s land inventory and communities under development demonstrated potential
impairment indicators and were accordingly tested for potential impairment. For the years
ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company recorded valuation adjustments of $203.8 million
and $7.7 million, respectively, to reduce the carrying value of the impaired projects to their
estimated fair value. The Company did not record valuation adjustments on land inventory for
the year ended December 31, 2004.

Net
realizable value adjustments — land held for sale

In accordance with SFAS 144, the Company values long-lived assets held for sale at the
lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The Company records these net
realizable value adjustments in its Consolidated Statements of Operations within Homebuilding
expense, which includes land cost of sales. During 2006, as a result of changing market
conditions in the real estate industry, a portion of the Company’s land held for sale was
written down to net realizable value. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
the Company recognized net realizable value adjustments related to land held for sale of $54.6
million, $3.1 million and $265,000, respectively.

Write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs

From time to time, the Company writes off certain deposits and pre-acquisition costs
related to land option contracts the Company no longer plans to pursue. The Company wrote off
deposits and pre-acquisition costs in the amount of $151.2 million, $19.2 million and $27
million during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Write-offs of
deposits and pre-acquisition costs for land option contracts the Company no longer plans to
pursue are recorded within its Consolidated Statements of Operations within Homebuilding
expense, which includes other income (expense), net.

Plant Closure

In connection with the closure of its production facility located in Virginia, the Company
recorded an $18.5 million charge during 2006, which primarily includes the write-down of
long-lived assets of $6.7 million, lease termination costs of $10.7 million and other exit
costs of $1.1 million. These costs have
been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations within Homebuilding expense. Exit
activities related to the plant closure will continue during 2007 but are not expected to have
a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Inventories

Finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated cost or net realizable
value. Inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost,
unless certain facts indicate such cost would not be recovered from the cash flows generated by
future disposition. In this instance, such inventories are measured at fair value.

Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis. Under the specific
identification basis, cost of sales includes the construction cost of the home, an average lot
cost by project based on land acquisition and development costs, and closing costs and
commissions. Construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of
the home, plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted
construction cost. This accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after
closing compared to the amount accrued, and adjustments are made if needed. Total project land
acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared to actual
costs incurred to date and estimates to complete. Adjustments to estimated total project land
acquisition and development costs for the project affect the amount of future lots costed.

The Company capitalizes interest cost into homebuilding inventories. Each layer of
capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of
communities under development. Interest expense is allocated over the period based on the
cyclical timing of unit settlements. The Company capitalized interest of $261.5 million,
$185.8 million and $156.1 million and expensed to home cost of sales $255.7 million, $179.6
million and $133 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. For the years ended December
31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, the Company incurred interest of $266.6 million, $234 million and
$205.2 million, respectively.

Land, not owned, under option agreements

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into land option agreements in
order to procure land for the construction of homes in the future. Pursuant to these land
option agreements, the Company will provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the
right to purchase land at different times in the future, usually at predetermined prices.
Under FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” as amended by
FIN 46-R issued in December 2003 (collectively referred to as “FIN 46”), if the entity holding
the land under option is a variable interest entity, the Company’s deposit represents a
variable interest in that entity. Creditors of the variable interest entities have no recourse
against the Company.

In applying the provisions of FIN 46, the Company evaluated all land option agreements and
determined that the Company was subject to a majority of the expected losses or entitled to
receive a majority of the expected residual returns under a limited number of these agreements.
As the primary beneficiary under these agreements, the Company is required to consolidate
variable interest entities at fair value. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company
classified $43.6 million and $76.7 million, respectively, as land, not owned, under option
agreements on the balance sheet, representing the fair value of land under contract, including
deposits of $6 million and $13.4 million, respectively. The corresponding liability has been
classified within accrued and other liabilities on the balance sheet.

Land option agreements that did not require consolidation under FIN 46 at December 31,
2006 and 2005 had a total purchase price of $4.3 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively. In
connection with these agreements, the Company had deposits and advanced costs of $363.5 million
and $431.4 million, included in other assets at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Land held for sale

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had approximately $465.8 million and
$257.7 million of land held for sale related to its Homebuilding operations. Land held for
sale is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell.

Allowance for warranties

Home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building defects. The
specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary geographically. Most warranties cover
different aspects of the home’s construction and operating systems
for a period of up to ten years. The Company estimates the costs to be incurred under these
warranties and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is
recognized. Factors that affect the Company’s warranty liability include the number of homes
sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. The Company
periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded allowance for warranties and adjusts the
amount as necessary.

Certain non-recurring warranty expenses which were previously classified within the
Company’s insurance reserves have been reclassified to allowance for warranties as of December
31, 2006. Amounts for the year ended December 31, 2005 have been reclassified to conform to
the 2006 presentation.

closing of the sale, when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer.
In situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by Pulte Mortgage, the Company’s
wholly-owned mortgage subsidiary, and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing
investment as required by SFAS No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate,” the profit on
such sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a third-party investor
has been completed. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had deferred profit on such
sales in the amounts of $40.7 million and $25.5 million, respectively.

Start-up costs

Costs and expenses associated with entry into new homebuilding markets and opening
new communities in existing markets are expensed when incurred.

Financial Services

Mortgage servicing rights

The Company allocates the cost of mortgage loans originated between the mortgage
loans and the right to service those mortgage loans, based on relative fair value, on the date
the loan is sold.

The Company sells its servicing rights monthly on a flow basis through fixed price
servicing sales contracts. Due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held, the
Company does not amortize the servicing asset. Furthermore, there are no impairment issues
since the servicing rights are recorded based on the value in the servicing sales contracts.
The servicing sales contracts provide for the reimbursement of payments made by the purchaser
if loans prepay within specified periods of time, usually 90 days after sale or securitization.
The Company established reserves for this liability of $5.5 million and $5.2 million at
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, included in accrued and other liabilities, at the
time the sale was
recorded. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, total servicing rights recognized were $43.5 million,
$31.7 million, and $25.3 million, respectively.

Residential mortgage loans available-for-sale

Residential mortgage loans available-for-sale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or
market value. Unamortized net mortgage discounts totaled $6.9 million and $4.8 million at
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These discounts are not amortized as interest
revenue during the period the loans are held for sale.

Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. The
Company hedges its residential mortgage loans available-for-sale. Gains and losses from closed
commitments and forward contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on the sale
of mortgage loans. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, net gains from the sale of mortgages were
$110.8 million, $81.1 million and $50.3 million, respectively, which have been included in
Financial Services revenue.

An allowance for credit losses is established when specific loans are identified as
probable of foreclosure and loss. Additionally, an allowance is provided based on historical
losses applied against the most recent quarter of funded production.

Interest income on mortgage loans

Interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is
sold. Loans are placed on non-accrual status once they become greater than 90 days past due
their contractual terms. Subsequent payments received are applied according to the contractual
terms of the loan.

Mortgage servicing, origination and commitment fees

Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors.
Servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance, or a
contracted set fee in the case of certain sub-servicing, and are credited to income when
related mortgage payments are received. Loan origination fees, commitment fees and certain
direct loan origination costs on funded loans are deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the
related mortgage loan until such loan is sold.

Derivative instruments and hedging activities

The Company recognizes all of its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities
in the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains
or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies
as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those
derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the Company must
designate the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as either a fair value
hedge or a cash flow hedge.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge (i.e.,
hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a
particular risk), the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is
reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the
same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. For derivative
instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the gain or loss is recognized in current
earnings during the period of change.

Market risks arise from commitments to lend, movements in interest rates and cancelled or
modified commitments to lend. In order to reduce these risks, the Company uses derivative
financial instruments. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on
mortgage-backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury futures
contracts, and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage-backed securities. The
Company does not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. A commitment
to lend at a specified interest rate is a derivative instrument (interest rate is locked to the
borrower). When the Company commits to lend to the borrower, the Company enters into one of
the aforementioned derivative financial instruments to economically hedge the rate lock
derivative. The changes in the value of the loan commitment and the derivative financial
instrument are recognized in current earnings during the period of change. At December 31,
2006, commitments by the Company to originate mortgage loans totaled $144.8 million at interest
rates prevailing at the date of commitment.

Since the Company can terminate a loan commitment if the borrower does not comply with the
terms of the contract, and some loan commitments may expire without being drawn upon, these
commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates the
creditworthiness of these transactions through its normal credit policies.

Cash forward placement contracts on mortgage-backed securities are commitments to either
purchase or sell a specified financial instrument at a specified future date for a specified
price and may be settled in cash, by offsetting the position, or through the delivery of the
financial instrument. Options on treasury futures contracts and options on mortgage-backed
securities grant the purchaser, for a premium payment,
the right to either purchase or sell a specified treasury futures contract or a specified
mortgage-backed security, respectively, for a specified price within a specified period of time
or on a specified date from or to the writer of the option.

Financial Services (continued)

Derivative instruments and hedging activities (continued)

Mandatory cash forward contracts on mortgage-backed securities are the predominant
derivative financial instruments used to minimize the market risk during the period from when
the Company extends an interest rate lock to a loan applicant until the time the loan is sold
to an investor. Whole loan investor commitments are obligations of the investor to buy loans
at a specified price within a specified time period. At December 31, 2006, the Company had
unexpired cash forward contracts and whole loan investor commitments of $852.7 million.
Options on cash forward contracts on mortgage-backed securities are used in the same manner as
mandatory cash forward contracts, but provide protection from interest rates rising, while
still allowing an opportunity for profit if interest rates fall. Options on the treasury
futures contracts are used on various loan product types to protect the Company from unexpected
increases, cancellations or modifications in lending commitments. There were no outstanding
options on treasury futures contracts at December 31, 2006.

The Company enters into derivative instruments to hedge portions of its forecasted cash
flow from sales of mortgage-backed securities. At December 31, 2006, the maximum length of
time that the Company was exposed to the variability in future cash flows of derivative
instruments was approximately 75 days. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company
did not recognize any material net gains or losses related to an ineffective portion of the
hedging instrument. In addition, the Company did not recognize any material net gains or
losses during the year ended December 31, 2006 for cash flow hedges that were discontinued
because the forecasted transaction did not occur. At December 31, 2006, the Company expects to
reclassify $978 thousand, net of taxes, of net gains on derivative instruments from accumulated
other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months as sales of
mortgage-backed securities occur.

2. Segment information (continued)

Evaluation of segment performance is based on operating earnings from continuing
operations before provision for income taxes which, for the homebuilding operations, is defined
as home sales (settlements) and land sale revenues less home cost of sales, land cost of sales
and certain selling, general and administrative and other expenses, plus equity income from
unconsolidated entities, which are incurred by or allocated to our homebuilding segments.
Operating earnings for the financial services segment is defined as revenues less costs
associated with our mortgage operations and certain selling, general and administrative
expenses incurred by or allocated to the financial services segment.

Each reportable segment follows the same accounting policies described in Note 1 –
“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements.

First Heights

In the first quarter of 1994, the Company adopted a plan of disposal for First
Heights and announced its strategy to exit the thrift industry and increase its focus on
housing and related mortgage banking. First Heights sold all but one of its 32 bank branches
and related deposits to two unrelated purchasers. The sale was substantially completed during
the fourth quarter of 1994. Although the Company expected to complete the plan of disposal
within a reasonable period of time, contractual disputes
precluded the Company from completing the disposal in accordance with its original plan.

In August 2005, the United States Court of Appeals affirmed the United States Court of
Federal Claims final judgment, in its entirety, that the Company had been damaged by
approximately $48.7 million as a result of the United States government’s breach of contract in
connection with the enactment of Section 13224 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1993. In December 2005, the Company received payment of the judgment in the amount of $48.7
million, which was recorded as income from discontinued operations.

In September 2005, First Heights received notice confirming the voluntary dissolution of
the First Heights Bank. The Office of Thrift Supervision also canceled First Heights’ charter.
Accordingly, the day-to-day activities of First Heights, which had been principally devoted to
supporting residual regulatory compliance matters and the litigation with the United States
government (See Note 11), have now ceased.

During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, after-tax income was $189
thousand, $56.5 million and $10.5 million, respectively. The after-tax income for the years
ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 includes approximately $7.8 million and $10.8 million,
respectively, of net income related to the recognition of income tax benefits resulting from
the favorable resolution of certain tax matters.

3. Discontinued operations (continued)

Mexico Homebuilding Operations

In January 2005, the minority shareholders of Pulte Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V. (“Pulte
Mexico”) exercised a put option under the terms of a reorganization agreement dated as of
December 31, 2001, to sell their shares to the Company, the consummation of which resulted in
the Company owning 100% of Pulte Mexico. In March 2005, the Company purchased 60% of the
minority interest of Pulte Mexico for approximately $18.7 million in cash. In June 2005, the
Company purchased the remaining 40% of the minority interest of Pulte Mexico for approximately
$12.5 million in cash. The Company assigned approximately $17.6 million of the purchase price
premium to house and land inventory, which was amortized through cost of sales as homes were
sold. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the underlying assets
acquired and liabilities assumed, of $5.3 million, was recorded as goodwill.

In December 2005, the Company sold substantially all of its Mexico homebuilding operations
to a consortium of purchasers involved in residential and commercial real estate development.
The disposition of the Mexico operations will allow the Company to invest additional resources
in the U.S. housing market. The Company realized cash of $131.5 million related to the sale.
The sale of these operations did not include the Company’s investment in the capital stock of a
mortgage company in Mexico as well as various non-operating entities, which are not considered
to be material to the Company’s results of operations or its financial position.

Revenues of these discontinued operations were $201 million and $185.8 million for the
years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2005
and 2004, discontinued Mexico homebuilding operations reported total after-tax income (losses)
of ($1.5) million and $4.4 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and
2004, Mexico reported pre-tax operating income of $4.6 million and $8.2 million, respectively.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recognized a pre-tax loss of $6.6
million (after-tax loss of $13.1 million) related to the sale of its Mexico homebuilding
operations. The pre-tax loss on sale includes the accounting recognition of the economic
losses related to accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments of $7.6 million, as well
as the write-off of $5.3 million of goodwill related to the January 2005 acquisition of the
minority shareholder interests. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Mexico
operations have been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial
statements.

Concurrent with the sale of its Mexico homebuilding operations, the Company elected to
repatriate all of its earnings from its Mexico operations in accordance with the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 (Internal Revenue Code Section 965,
Temporary Dividends Received Deduction) and recorded $4.8 million of related income taxes,
which have been included in the Mexico loss on sale from discontinued operations.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, loss from discontinued operations included a
provision of $2.3 million, net of taxes, which resulted from a contractual adjustment related
to the December 2005 disposition of the Company’s Mexico homebuilding operations.

Argentina Operations

In January 2005, the Company sold all of its Argentina operations to an Argentine
company involved in residential and commercial real estate development. For the year ended
December 31, 2004, the Argentina operations are presented as discontinued operations in the
consolidated financial statements.

Revenues of these discontinued Argentine operations were $24.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2004 discontinued Argentine operations
reported total after-tax losses of $22 million. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the
Argentina operations reported after-tax operating losses of $1.4 million. In addition, the
Company recognized a pre-tax loss of $33.2 million ($20.6 million after-tax) on the write-down
of the Argentina operations to fair value less costs to sell. The pre-tax loss includes the
accounting recognition of the economic losses related to accumulated foreign currency
translation adjustments of $25.1 million ($15.6 million after-tax), which had previously been
reported in other comprehensive income.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, loss from discontinued operations included a
provision of $111 thousand, net of taxes, which resulted from a contractual adjustment related
to the January 2005 disposition of the Company’s Argentine homebuilding operations.



PULTE HOMES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

4. Investments in unconsolidated entities

The Company participates in a number of joint ventures with independent third
parties. Many of these joint ventures purchase, develop and/or sell land and homes in the
United States and Puerto Rico. If additional capital infusions are required and approved, the
Company would need to contribute its pro-rata portion of those capital needs in order not to
dilute its ownership in the joint ventures. During 2005, the Company invested approximately
$37.3 million in new joint ventures that develop and/or sell land within the United States.
There were no significant investments in new joint ventures during the year ended December 31,
2006.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company made additional capital contributions to
existing joint ventures totaling approximately $58.2 million and received capital distributions
from these entities totaling approximately $67.4 million. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the
Company had approximately $150.7 million and $286.6 million, respectively, invested in these
joint ventures. These investments are included in the assets of the Company’s Homebuilding
operations. As of December 31, 2006, a majority of these investments are accounted for under
the equity method.

In January 2006, the Company exercised its option and acquired the remaining 50% interest
in an entity that supplies and installs basic building components and operating systems. The
Company’s initial investment was made in January 2004 to secure a dedicated building supply
trade base for its construction activities in Arizona and Nevada. The aggregate stepped
purchase price exceeded the preliminary estimated fair value of the underlying assets acquired
and liabilities assumed by approximately $68 million, which was recorded as goodwill. The
Company accounted for its initial 50% investment under the equity method. Since January 2006,
the Company has consolidated this wholly-owned subsidiary in its financial statements.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures
was $935.9 million and $882.2 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the
Company’s proportionate share of its joint venture debt was approximately $312.8 million and
$297.9 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006, the Company provided non-recourse debt
guarantees for $304.1 million of joint venture debt. At December 31, 2005, the Company
provided non-recourse debt guarantees of approximately $293.4 million of joint venture debt.
Accordingly, the Company may be liable, on a contingent basis, through limited guarantees with
respect to a portion of the secured land acquisition and development debt. However, the
Company would not be liable other than in instances of fraud, misrepresentation or other bad
faith actions by the Company, unless the joint venture was unable to perform its contractual
borrowing obligations. As of December 31, 2006, the Company does not anticipate that it will
incur any significant costs under these
guarantees that have not already been recognized in our impairment analysis, as mentioned
below.

For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company recognized equity
income (loss) from its unconsolidated joint ventures of $(62.9) million, $75.4 million and
$60.1 million, respectively. The equity loss recognized during the year ended December 31,
2006 includes land valuation adjustments of $95.4 million, which relate to two of the Company’s
joint ventures located in Sacramento, California. In accordance with their debt guarantees,
these joint ventures are required to maintain a certain ratio of value of the collateral
(generally land and improvements) as a specified percentage of the loan balance. If the
Company is required to make a payment to bring the loan balance below the specified percentage
of the loan balance, the payment would constitute a capital contribution or loan to the
unconsolidated entity and increase the Company’s share of any funds the unconsolidated entity
distributes, if they are available. The land valuation adjustments recorded during 2006
include all significant costs expected at this time under such guarantees.

In February 2006, Pulte Mortgage sold its investment in Hipotecaria Su Casita (“Su
Casita”), a Mexico-based mortgage banking company. Remaining shareholders of Su Casita, who
exercised their right of first refusal to acquire the shares, purchased Pulte Mortgage’s 16.7%
interest for net proceeds of approximately $49.2 million. As a result of this transaction, the
Company recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $31.6 million ($20.1 million after-tax) for
the three months ended March 31, 2006. During February 2005, 25% of the Company’s investment
in the capital stock of Su Casita was redeemed for a pre-tax gain of approximately $620
thousand and the Company’s remaining ownership interest of 16.7% was accounted for under the
cost method. At December 31, 2005, the Company’s investment in this entity, which is included
in the assets of the Financial Services segment, was approximately $15.1 million.

In May 2006, the Company sold $150 million of 7.375% senior notes, which mature on
June 1, 2046, and are guaranteed by Pulte Homes, Inc. and certain of its 100%-owned
subsidiaries. These notes are unsecured and rank equally with all of the Company’s other
unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The notes are redeemable at any time on or after
June 1, 2011, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed, plus
accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. Proceeds from the sale were used
to repay the indebtedness of the Company’s revolving credit facility and for general corporate
purposes, including continued investment in the Company’s business.

6. Other financing arrangements

Corporate/Homebuilding

In August 2006, the Company increased the borrowing availability under its 5-year
unsecured revolving credit facility from $1.66 billion to $2.01 billion. The credit facility
includes an uncommitted accordion feature, under which the credit facility may be increased to
$2.25 billion. The Company has the capacity to issue letters of credit up to $1.125 billion.
Borrowing availability is reduced by the amount of letters of credit outstanding. The credit
facility contains restrictive covenants, the most restrictive of which requires the Company not
to exceed a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 60% and also requires the Company to maintain
a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2:1 (EBITDA to interest incurred), as defined in the
agreement. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no borrowings outstanding and $1.45
billion available for borrowing under this facility.

primarily from one to three years, a weighted average interest rate of 0.71%, are generally
collateralized by certain land positions and have no recourse to any other assets. These
arrangements have been classified as accrued and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

Financial Services

Notes payable to banks (collateralized short-term debt) are secured by residential
mortgage loans available-for-sale. The carrying amounts of such borrowings approximate fair
value.

6. Other financing arrangements (continued)

Financial Services (continued)

Pulte Mortgage supports its operations through the use of a revolving credit facility and
an asset-backed commercial paper program. At December 31, 2006, Pulte Mortgage had committed
credit arrangements of $955 million comprised of a $405 million bank revolving credit facility
which expires May 15, 2009, and a $550 million asset-backed commercial paper program which
expires August 13, 2007. In May 2006, Pulte Mortgage amended its revolving credit facility,
which included amendments to its restrictive covenants. In August 2006, Pulte Mortgage amended
the bank credit agreement related to its asset-backed commercial paper program, which also
included amendments to its restrictive covenants. Both amended credit agreements now require
Pulte Mortgage to maintain a consolidated tangible net worth of at least $50 million or
eighty-five percent of the average month-end tangible net worth for the last twelve months of
the preceding calendar year and funded debt cannot exceed 15 times tangible net worth. At
December 31, 2006, Pulte Mortgage had $814.7 million outstanding under its committed credit
arrangements.

During the three years ended December 31, 2006, Pulte Mortgage provided compensating
balances, in the form of escrows and other custodial funds, in order to further reduce interest
rates.

Various state net operating losses aggregating $171.2 million expire in years 2009
through 2026. Net operating losses are generally available to offset the Company’s taxable
income in future years. Management believes that certain of these state net operating losses
will not be utilized prior to their
expiration. As such, a valuation allowance has been recorded as indicated above. During 2006,
a state credit carryforward of $10.8 million was realized by the Company.

In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company repatriated the earnings of its Mexican
subsidiaries. The earnings were distributed pursuant to the provisions of the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 (Internal Revenue Code Section 965, Temporary Dividends Received
Deduction). The income taxes associated with such repatriation, $4.8 million, were recorded
within the Mexico discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 provided a 3% tax deduction on the lesser of
taxable income or qualified domestic production activities income for the years ended December
31, 2006 and 2005. The deduction increases to 6% for years ending after December 31, 2006 and
to 9% for years ending after December 31, 2009. Based on the guidance provided by FASB Staff
Position 109-1, “Application of FASB Statement No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

, to the Tax
Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004”, this deduction was accounted for as a special deduction under SFAS No. 109 and reduced
income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.

10. Leases

The Company leases certain property and equipment under non-cancelable leases.
Office and equipment leases are generally for terms of three to five years and generally
provide renewal options for terms of up to an additional three years. In most cases,
management expects that in the normal course of business, leases that expire will be renewed or
replaced by other leases. The future minimum lease payments required under operating leases
that have initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year are as follows

Net rental expense for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $78.5 million,
$73.1 million, and $55.7 million, respectively. Certain leases contain purchase options and
generally provide that the Company shall pay for insurance, taxes and maintenance.

11. Commitments and contingencies

In the normal course of business, the Company acquires rights under options or option-type
agreements to purchase land to be used in homebuilding operations at future dates. The total
purchase price applicable to land under option that has been approved for purchase approximated
$3.9 billion and $5.7 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The total purchase
price applicable to land under option that has not been approved for purchase approximated
$450.3 million and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. At December 31,
2006 and 2005, the Company, in the normal course of business, had outstanding letters of credit
and performance bonds of $2.4 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively.

The Company could be required to repurchase loans sold to investors that have not been
underwritten in accordance with the investor guidelines (“defective loans”). The Company, in
the normal course of business, indemnifies investors for defective loans that they have
purchased. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had been notified of $2.5 million
and $4.1 million of defective loans, respectively. The Company assesses the risk of loss on
these indemnifications and establishes reserves for them. At December 31, 2006 and 2005,
reserves for indemnification on defective loans are reflected in accrued and other liabilities
and amounted to $135 thousand and $242 thousand, respectively.

The Company is involved in various litigation incidental to its continuing business
operations. Management does not believe that this litigation will have a material adverse
impact on the results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.

Storm Water Discharge Practices

In April 2004, the Company received a request for information from the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) pursuant to Section 308 of the Clean Water Act. The
request seeks information about storm water discharge practices in connection with homebuilding
projects completed or underway by the Company. The Company has provided the EPA with this
information. Although the matter has since been referred to the United States Department of
Justice (“DOJ”) for enforcement, the EPA has asked that the Company engage in “pre-filing”
negotiations to resolve the matter short of litigation. The Company continues to participate
actively in these negotiations. If the negotiations fail and the DOJ alleges that the Company
has violated regulatory requirements applicable to storm water discharges, the government may
seek injunctive relief and penalties. The Company believes that it has defenses to any such
allegations. At this time, however, the Company can neither predict the outcome of this
inquiry, nor can it currently estimate the costs that may be associated with its eventual
resolution.

First Heights-related litigation

Pulte Homes, Inc. was a party to a lawsuit relating to First Heights’ 1988 acquisition
from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (“FSLIC”) and First Heights’ ownership
of five failed Texas thrifts. The lawsuit was filed on December 26, 1996, in the United States
Court of Federal Claims (Washington, D.C.) by Pulte Homes, Inc., Pulte Diversified Companies,
Inc. and First Heights (collectively, the Pulte Parties) against the United States. The Pulte
Parties asserted breach of contract on the part of the United States in connection with the
enactment of Section 13224 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (“OBRA”). That
provision repealed portions of the tax benefits that the Pulte Parties claim they were entitled
to under the contract to acquire the failed Texas thrifts. The Pulte Parties also asserted
other claims concerning the contract, including that the United States (through the FDIC as
receiver) improperly attempted to amend the failed thrifts’ pre-acquisition tax returns and
that this attempt was made in an effort to deprive the Pulte Parties of tax benefits for which
they had contracted.

On August 17, 2001, the United States Court of Federal Claims ruled that the United States
government is liable to the Pulte Parties for breach of contract by enacting Section 13224 of
OBRA. In September 2003, the United States Court of Federal Claims issued final judgment that
the Pulte Parties had been damaged by approximately $48.7 million as a result of the United
States government’s breach of contract with them. The United States government and the Pulte
Parties appealed the final judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit in October 2003.

In August 2005, the Appeals Court affirmed the United States Court of Federal Claims
judgment, in its entirety. In December 2005, the Company received payment of the judgment in
the amount of $48.7 million, which was recorded as income from discontinued operations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Pulte Homes, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pulte Homes, Inc. (the
“Company”) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2006. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Pulte Homes, Inc. at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of Pulte Homes, Inc.’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated January 31, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

This Item is not applicable.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Management, including our President & Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President &
Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of December 31, 2006. Based upon, and as of the date of that
evaluation, our President & Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President & Chief Financial
Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31,
2006.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

(a) Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated
financial statements included in this annual report. The consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles and reflect
management’s judgments and estimates concerning events and transactions that are accounted for or
disclosed.

Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that pertain to the Company’s ability to record, process, summarize and
report reliable financial data. Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the
effectiveness of any internal control and effective internal control over financial reporting can
provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Additionally,
because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
may vary over time.

In order to ensure that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective,
management regularly assesses such controls and did so most recently for its financial reporting as
of December 31, 2006. Management’s assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control
over financial reporting described in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment,
management asserts that the Company has maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006.

Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the
Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, has issued its report
on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006.



Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (continued)

b) Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Pulte Homes, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Pulte Homes, Inc. maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Pulte Homes, Inc.’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Pulte Homes, Inc. maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Pulte Homes, Inc. maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006,
based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Pulte Homes, Inc. as of
December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’
equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2006 and our report dated January 31, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

/s/ Ernst & Young LLP

Detroit, Michigan

January 31, 2007

(c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter
ended December 31, 2006 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
