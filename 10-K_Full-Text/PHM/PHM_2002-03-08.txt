ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Pulte Homes, Inc.

Pulte Homes, Inc. (“Pulte” or the “Company”) is a publicly held holding
company whose subsidiaries engage in the homebuilding and financial services
businesses. Our assets consist principally of the capital stock of our
subsidiaries, cash and investments. Our income primarily consists of dividends
from our subsidiaries and interest on investments. Our direct subsidiaries
include Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc. (PDCI), Del Webb Corporation and
other subsidiaries which are engaged in the homebuilding business. PDCI’s
operating subsidiaries include Pulte Home Corporation (PHC), Pulte
International Corporation (International) and other subsidiaries which are
engaged in the homebuilding business. PDCI’s non-operating thrift subsidiary,
First Heights Bank, fsb (First Heights), is classified as a discontinued
operation (see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We also
have a mortgage banking company, Pulte Mortgage Corporation (PMC), which is a
subsidiary of PHC.

We have three reportable business segments: Homebuilding, Financial
Services and Corporate. The Homebuilding segment consists of the following two
business units:

•

Domestic Homebuilding, our core business, is engaged in the
acquisition and development of land primarily for residential purposes
within the continental United States and the construction of housing on
such land targeted for the first-time, first and second move-up, and
active adult home buyers.

•

International Homebuilding is primarily engaged in the acquisition
and development of land primarily for residential purposes, and the
construction of housing on such land in Mexico, Puerto Rico and
Argentina.

The Financial Services segment consists principally of mortgage banking
operations conducted through PMC and its subsidiaries.

Corporate is a non-operating business segment whose primary purpose is to
support the operations of our subsidiaries as the internal source of financing,
to develop and implement strategic initiatives centered on new business
development and operating efficiencies, and to provide the necessary
administrative functions to support Pulte as a publicly traded entity.

Financial information, including revenue, pre-tax income and identifiable
assets of each of our business segments is included in Note 2 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.



Homebuilding Operations

Unit sales (settlements) and net new orders in any year are strongly
influenced by local, regional and national market economic conditions.

Domestic Homebuilding

We build a wide variety of homes, including detached units, townhouses,
condominium apartments and duplexes, with varying prices, models, options and
lot sizes, all sold for use as principal residences. Since 1990, we have more
than quadrupled our annual unit closings, unit orders and unit backlog levels.
Including 2001 sales of nearly 23,000 homes, we have closed nearly 300,000
homes since our inception.

On July 31, 2001, we merged with Del Webb Corporation in a tax-free
stock-for-stock transaction. Del Webb is primarily a homebuilder with
operations in six states. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, Del Webb
reported net income of $91.2 million on revenues of $1.9 billion and 7,038 unit
settlements. Backlog reported at June 30, 2001, was 3,682 units valued at
approximately $994 million. This merger expands and supports our leadership
position. In particular, we believe the merger will strengthen our position
among active adult homebuyers, enhance our overall land position, provide
operational savings from economies of scale while enhancing purchasing
leverage, and enhance our overall competitive position. In accordance with our
operational strategy, we will continue to evaluate available strategic
acquisition opportunities that coincide with our long-range goals.

As of December 31, 2001, our Domestic Homebuilding operations offered
homes for sale in 440 communities at sales prices ranging from $75,000 to
$1,200,000. Sales prices of homes currently offered for sale in 76% of our
communities fall within the range of $150,000 to $450,000 with a 2001 average
unit selling price of $225,000. Sales of single-family detached homes, as a
percentage of total unit sales, were 82% in 2001 and 2000 and 79% in 1999,
respectively. Our Domestic Homebuilding operations are geographically diverse
to better insulate us from demand changes in individual markets. As of
December 31, 2001, our Domestic Homebuilding business operated in 43 markets
spanning 25 states.



Homebuilding Operations (continued)

International Homebuilding

International Homebuilding operations are primarily conducted through
subsidiaries of Pulte International Corporation in Mexico, Puerto Rico and
Argentina. International Homebuilding product offerings focus on the demand of
first-time buyers and social interest housing in Mexico and Puerto Rico.
Housing for middle-to-upper income consumers is available in Puerto Rico and
Argentina. We have agreements in place with multi-national corporations to
provide social interest housing in Mexico.

Mexico

International’s 100%-owned subsidiary, Pulte International Mexico,
Inc., conducts its operations primarily through five joint ventures located
throughout Mexico. The largest of these ventures, Condak-Pulte S. De R.L. De
C.V. (Condak-Pulte), is based in Cuidad Juarez. Condak-Pulte is currently
developing communities in Juarez, Chihuahua, Nuevo Laredo, Monterrey, Reynosa,
Saltillo and Matamoros, under agreements with Delphi Automotive Systems,
Gigante, S.A. de C.V. and Centro Comerciales Soriana, S.A. De C. V.

Desarrollos Residenciales Turisticos, S.A. de C.V. (DRT), another joint
venture in Mexico, is constructing primarily social interest housing in Central
Mexico. Current development plans for this venture include housing projects in
the Bajio region surrounding Mexico City, targeting the cities of Celaya, Leon,
Puebla, Queretaro, San Jose du Iturbide and San Juan del Rio.

Effective January 1, 2002, Pulte International reorganized its structure
within Mexico to create a single company, Pulte Mexico, which ranks as one of
the largest builders in the country. The new operating structure will
facilitate growth, enable operating leverage and improve efficiencies through
standardized systems and procedures. The new company, which combines several
entities, including Condak-Pulte and DRT, will be consolidated into our
financial statements.

Puerto Rico

Operations in Puerto Rico are primarily conducted through
International’s 100%-owned subsidiary, Pulte International Caribbean
Corporation. Desarrolladores Urbanos (Canovanas), S.E., its Puerto Rican joint
venture, is developing 121 acres located in Metropolitan San Juan.

Argentina

Operations in Argentina are conducted through Pulte S.R.L.,
International’s 100%-owned Argentine subsidiary which recorded its first
closings during the second quarter of 2001.

Land Acquisition and Development

Locations for development of homebuilding communities are selected after
completing extensive market research, enabling us to match the location and
product offering with our targeted consumer group. Factors considered include
proximity to developed areas, population and job growth patterns and, if
applicable, estimated development costs. We have historically managed the risk
of controlling our land positions through use of option contracts and outright
acquisition. We typically control land with the intent to complete sales of
housing units within 24 months from the date of opening a community, except in
the case of certain active-adult developments and our Del Webb operations for
which the completion of housing unit sales require a longer time period. As a
result, land is generally controlled after it is properly zoned and developed
or is ready for development. In addition, we dispose of owned land not
required in the business. Where we develop land, we engage directly in many
phases of the development process, including land and site planning, obtaining
environmental and other regulatory approvals, as well as constructing roads,
sewers, water and drainage facilities, and other amenities. We use our staff
and the services of independent engineers and consultants for land development
activities. Land development work is performed primarily by subcontractors and
local government authorities which construct sewer and water systems in some
areas. At December 31, 2001, we owned approximately 82,400 lots and had
approximately 35,000 lots under option.

Sales and Marketing

We are dedicated to improving the quality and value of our domestic homes
through innovative proprietary architectural and community designs and
state-of-the-art customer marketing techniques. Analyzing various qualitative
and quantitative data obtained through extensive market research, we segment
our potential customers into well-defined buyer profiles. Once the demands of
potential buyers are understood, we link our home design and community
development efforts to the specific lifestyle of each targeted consumer group.



Homebuilding Operations (continued)

Sales and Marketing (continued)

To meet the demands of our various domestic customers, we have established
a solid design expertise for a wide array of product lines. We believe that we
are an innovator in the design of our homes and we view design capacity as an
integral aspect of our marketing strategy. Our in-house architectural services
teams and management, supplemented by outside consultants, are successful in
creating distinctive design features, both in exterior facades and interior
options and features. A strategy in certain markets is to offer “the complete
house” in which all features shown in the home are included in the sales price.
Standard features typically offered include vaulted ceilings, appliances, and
a selection of flooring and carpet, which the buyer chooses.

Typically, our own domestic sales teams, together with outside sales
brokers, are responsible for managing the customer through the sales process.
We have been committed to industry-leading customer service through a variety
of quality initiatives, including the customer care program, which ensures that
homeowners are comfortable at every stage of the building process. Using a
seven-step, interactive process, homeowners are kept informed during their
homebuilding and home owning experience. The steps include (1) a
pre-construction meeting with the superintendent; (2) pre-dry wall frame walk;
(3) quality assurance inspection; (4) first homeowner orientation; (5) 30-day
follow-up after the close of the home; (6) three-month follow-up; and (7) an
11-month quality list after the close of the home. Fully furnished and
landscaped model homes are used to showcase our homes and their distinctive
design features. We have great success with the first-time buyer in the low to
moderate price range; in such cases, financing under United States
Government-insured and guaranteed programs is often used and is facilitated
through our mortgage company. We also enjoy strong sales to the move-up buyer
and, in certain markets, offer semi-custom homes in higher price ranges.

In 2001, J.D. Power and Associates recognized our Colorado, Charlotte, Las
Vegas and Southern California markets for ranking the highest in their markets
in customer satisfaction in the J.D. Power and Associates 2001 New Home Builder
Customer Satisfaction
StudySM. The survey of ten U.S. markets noted customer
service and home readiness as the two factors that most heavily influenced the
customer’s overall level of satisfaction. We finished third or better in seven
of the ten markets surveyed. Building on this quality foundation is our brand
development program with our “Three I’s on Quality” platform. Developing the
Pulte Homes brand and leveraging the strength of the “DiVosta,” “Del Webb” and
“Sun City” names not only distinguishes our communities from the competition,
but it also earns a price premium in the marketplace, reduces overall customer
acquisition costs and can result in additional sales.

In addition, our Homeowner for Life™ strategy and philosophy has increased
our business from those who have previously owned a Pulte home or been referred
by a Pulte homeowner by ensuring a positive home buying and home owning
experience. In 2001, we saw an increase to 36 percent of these repeat/referral
buyers. That represents almost $2 billion in revenues in 2001. We introduce
our homes to prospective buyers through a variety of media advertising,
illustrated brochures, Internet listings and link placements, and other
advertising displays. Customers are also obtained through referrals from other
Pulte customers. In addition, our website,

www.pulte.com

, enables users to
search for their home, obtain details regarding the local schools, services and
other features, examine mortgage options using an online calculator, learn more
about us and communicate directly with us. Over three million potential
customers have visited

www.pulte.com

since January 1, 2000.

As a result of the merger with Del Webb, we are better able to address the
needs of active adults, the fastest growing homebuying segment. With
destination communities offering highly amenitized products, such as golf
courses, recreational centers and educational classes, the active adult buyer
has many options to maintain an active lifestyle.

Our international sales and marketing efforts focus on the identification
of regions throughout Mexico, Puerto Rico and Argentina which are experiencing
population and industrial growth. In Mexico and Puerto Rico, the demand for
affordable and social interest housing is strong. In Mexico, Condak-Pulte has
entered into three separate agreements to construct affordable social interest
housing with Delphi Automotive Systems, Gigante, S. A. de C.V. and Centrol
Comerciales Soriana, S. A. de C.V. In Puerto Rico, the strongest customer
demand is for single-family detached homes, but affordable alternative product
offerings include two story attached units (townhomes) and three-story
condominium units with exterior stairs (walk-ups). The Argentine market offers
low levels of competition and a very large residential market in Buenos Aires.



Homebuilding Operations (continued)

Construction

The construction process for our domestic homes begins with the in-house
design of the homes we sell. The building phase is conducted under the
supervision of our on-site construction superintendents. The construction work
is usually performed by subcontractors under contracts which, in many
instances, cover both labor and materials on a fixed-price basis. We believe
that Pulte Preferred Partnerships (P3), an extension of our quality assurance
program, continues to establish new standards for contractor relations. Using
a selective process, we have teamed up with what we believe are premier
contractors and suppliers to improve all aspects of the land development and
house construction processes.

We maintain efficient construction operations by using standard materials
and components from a variety of sources and, when possible, by building on
contiguous lots. To minimize the effects of changes in construction costs, the
subcontracting and purchasing of building supplies and materials are generally
negotiated at or near the time when related sales contracts are signed. In
addition, we utilize the leverage our size affords by actively negotiating our
materials needs on a national or regional basis to minimize component
production cost. We are also working to establish a more integrated system
that can effectively link suppliers, contractors and the production schedule
through various strategic business partnerships and e-business initiatives.

Housing in Mexico and Puerto Rico consists primarily of reinforced poured
concrete, concrete and ceramic block and/or brick construction with flat roofs
and public water, electric and sanitary system connections. Our Argentine
housing product is designed and constructed in a similar fashion to our
domestic product but is customized for local preferences. Building materials,
supplies and components are sourced locally and the construction work is
performed by general contractors and/or subcontractors under contracts, which
in many cases, include both labor and materials.

We cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials will
be available at reasonable prices in the future and have, on occasion,
experienced shortages of skilled labor in certain trades and of building
materials in some markets.

Competition and Other Factors

Our dedication to customer satisfaction is evidenced by our consumer and
value-based brand approach to product development, and is something that we
believe distinguishes us in the homebuilding industry and contributes to our
long-term competitive advantage. The housing industry in the United States,
however, is highly competitive. In each of our market areas, there are
numerous homebuilders with which we compete. Any provider of housing units,
for-sale or to rent, including apartment builders, may be considered a
competitor. Conversion of apartments to condominiums further provides certain
segments of the population an alternative to traditional housing, as does
manufactured housing. We compete primarily on the basis of price, reputation,
design and quality of our homes as well as location. The housing industry is
cyclical and is affected by a number of economic and other factors including:
(1) significant national and world events, which impact consumer confidence;
(2) changes in interest rates; (3) changes in other costs associated with home
ownership, such as property taxes and energy costs; (4) various demographic
factors; (5) changes in federal income tax laws; and (6) changes in government
mortgage financing programs. In addition to these factors, our business and
operations could be affected by unanticipated shifts in demand for new homes.

Our operations are subject to building, environmental and other
regulations of various federal, state, local and foreign governing authorities.
For our homes to qualify for Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or Veterans
Administration (VA) mortgages, we must satisfy valuation standards and site,
material and construction requirements of those agencies. Our compliance with
federal, state, local and foreign laws relating to protection of the
environment has had, to date, no material effect upon capital expenditures,
earnings or competitive position. More stringent requirements could be imposed
in the future on homebuilders and developers, thereby increasing the cost of
compliance.



Financial Services Operations

Our financial services operations are conducted by our mortgage banking
and other financial subsidiaries, including Pulte Mortgage Corporation and Del
Webb Mortgage Corporation.

Mortgage Banking

Our mortgage bank arranges financing through the origination of mortgage
loans primarily for the benefit of our domestic homebuyers, but also services
the general public. We also engage in the sale of such loans and the related
servicing rights. We are a lender approved by the FHA and VA and are a
seller/servicer approved by Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA),
Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation (FHLMC) and other investors. In our conventional mortgage lending
activities, we follow underwriting guidelines established by FNMA and FHLMC.

Our mortgage underwriting, processing and closing functions are
centralized in Denver, Colorado using a mortgage operations center (MOC)
concept. We also use a centralized telephone loan officer concept where loan
officers are centrally located at a mortgage application center (MAC) in
Denver. Our sales representatives, who are the mortgage customers’ main
contact, forward the loan applications to a MAC loan counselor who calls the
customer to complete the loan application and then forwards it to the MOC for
processing. We believe both the MOC and the MAC improve the speed and
efficiency of our mortgage operations, thereby improving profitability and
allowing us to focus on creating attractive mortgage financing opportunities
for our customers.

In originating mortgage loans, we initially use our own funds and
borrowings made available to us through various credit arrangements.
Subsequently, we sell such mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities to
outside investors.

During the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, we originated
mortgage loans for 60%, 56% and 55%, respectively, of the homes we sold. Such
originations represented 79%, 83% and 79%, respectively, of our originations.

We sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing
sales contracts to reduce the risks inherent in servicing loans. This strategy
results in owning the servicing rights for only a short period of time, usually
three to four months after the loan is originated, which substantially reduces
impairment issues with respect to the fair value of these reported assets.

The mortgage industry in the United States is highly competitive. We
compete with other mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide
attractive mortgage financing to both our customers and to the general public.
In originating and servicing mortgage loans, we are subject to rules and
regulations of the FHA, VA, GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC. The Internet is also an
important resource for homebuyers in obtaining financing as a number of
companies provide online approval for their customers. These Internet-based
mortgage companies may also be considered competitors.

Discontinued Operations

During the first quarter of 1994, we adopted a plan of disposal for First
Heights and announced our strategy to exit the thrift industry and increase our
focus on housing and related mortgage banking. First Heights sold all but one
of its 32 bank branches and related deposits to two unrelated purchasers. The
sale was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 1994.

Although in 1994, we expected to complete the plan of disposal within a
reasonable period of time, contractual disputes with the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) prevented the prepayment of the Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corporation Resolution Fund (FRF) notes, thereby precluding
us from completing the disposal in accordance with our original plan. To
provide liquidity for the sale, First Heights liquidated its investment
portfolios and its single-family residential loan portfolio and, as provided in
the Assistance Agreement, entered into a Liquidity Assistance Note (LAN) with
the FDIC acting in its capacity as manager of the FRF notes. The LAN was
collateralized by the FRF notes. The LAN and FRF notes matured in September
1998; however, payment of these obligations was withheld by both parties
pending resolution of all open matters with the FDIC. As discussed in Note 10
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company settled its
litigation with the FDIC in October 2001, and as part of that settlement all
obligations under the LAN and FRF notes were extinguished.



Financial Services Operations (continued)

Discontinued Operations (continued)

First Heights no longer holds any deposits, nor does it maintain an
investment portfolio. First Heights’ day-to-day activities are principally
devoted to supporting residual regulatory compliance matters and the litigation
with the United States government and are not reflective of the active
operations of the former thrift, such as maintaining traditional transaction
accounts, (e.g., checking and savings accounts) or making loans. Accordingly,
such operations are presented as discontinued.

Corporate

Corporate is a non-operating segment that is comprised of the Company and
PDCI, both of which are holding companies. The primary purpose of Corporate is
to support the operations of our subsidiaries as the internal source of
financing, and to develop and implement strategic initiatives centered around
new business development and operating efficiencies. Business development
activities include the pursuit of additional domestic and international
opportunities as well as the development of innovative building components and
processes. Corporate also includes the activities associated with supporting a
publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

Corporate assets include equity investments in its subsidiaries,
short-term financial instruments and affiliate advances. Liabilities include
senior and subordinated debt and income taxes. Corporate revenues consist
primarily of investment earnings of excess funds, while its expenses include
costs associated with supporting a publicly traded company and its
subsidiaries’ operations, and investigating strategic initiatives.

Organization/Employees

All subsidiaries and operating units operate independently with respect to
daily operations. Homebuilding real estate purchases and other significant
homebuilding, mortgage banking, financing activities and similar operating
decisions must be approved by the business unit and/or corporate senior
management.

At December 31, 2001, we employed approximately 9,400 persons. Our
employees are not represented by any union. Subcontracted work, however, may
be performed by union subcontractors. Homebuilding and mortgage banking
management personnel are paid performance bonuses and incentive compensation.
Performance bonuses are based on individual performance while incentive
compensation is based on the performance of the applicable division or
subsidiary. Our corporate management personnel are paid incentive compensation
based on overall performance of the Company (see Note 7 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements). Each subsidiary is given autonomy
regarding employment of personnel, although our senior corporate management act
in an advisory capacity in the employment of subsidiary officers. We consider
our employee and subcontractor relations to be satisfactory.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Our homebuilding and corporate headquarters are located at 33 Bloomfield
Hills Parkway, Suite 200, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan 48304, where 34,559 square
feet of office space is leased. We also lease 21,612 square feet of office
space at 165 Kirts Boulevard, Troy, Michigan 48084 for certain centralized
business support services. We own 148,727 square feet of office space at 6001
North 24th Street, Phoenix, Arizona 85016 for use by our Del Webb operations
and for certain corporate and business services. Pulte Mortgage Corporation’s
offices are located at 7475 South Joliet Street, Englewood, Colorado 80112. At
this location, approximately 60,000 square feet of office space is leased. Our
homebuilding markets and mortgage branch operations generally lease office
space for their day-to-day operations. First Heights’ administrative office is
located in 918 square feet of leased space at 2010 North Loop West, Suite 220,
Houston, Texas 77018.

Because of the nature of our homebuilding operations, significant amounts
of property are held as inventory in the ordinary course of our homebuilding
business. Such properties are not included in response to this Item.



ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are involved in various litigation incidental to our continuing
business operations. We believe that none of this litigation will have a
material adverse impact on our results of operations, our financial position or
our cash flows.

First Heights-related litigation

We were a party to three lawsuits relating to First Heights’ 1988
acquisition from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) and
First Heights’ ownership of five failed Texas thrifts. The first lawsuit (the
“District Court Case”) was filed on July 7, 1995, in the United States District
Court, Eastern District of Michigan, by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) against the Company, PDCI and First Heights (collectively,
the “Pulte Parties”). The second lawsuit (the “Court of Federal Claims Case”)
was filed on December 26, 1996, in the United States Court of Federal Claims
(Washington, D.C.) by the Pulte Parties against the United States. The third
lawsuit was filed by First Heights on January 10, 2000, in the United States
District Court, Eastern District of Michigan against the FDIC regarding the
amounts, including interest, the FDIC was obligated to pay First Heights on two
promissory notes which had been executed by the FDIC’s predecessor, the FSLIC.

In the District Court Case, the FDIC, as successor to the FSLIC, sought a
declaration of rights and other relief related to the Assistance Agreement
entered into between First Heights and the FSLIC. The FDIC and the Pulte
Parties disagreed about the proper interpretation of provisions in the
Assistance Agreement which provide for sharing of certain tax benefits achieved
in connection with First Heights’ 1988 acquisition and ownership of the five
failed Texas thrifts. The District Court Case also included certain other
claims relating to the foregoing, including claims resulting from the Company’s
and First Heights’ amendment of a tax sharing and allocation agreement between
the Company and First Heights. The Pulte Parties disputed the FDIC’s claims
and filed an answer and a counterclaim, seeking, among other things, a
declaration that the FDIC had breached the Assistance Agreement in numerous
respects. On December 24, 1996, the Pulte Parties voluntarily dismissed
without prejudice certain of their claims in the District Court Case and, on
December 26, 1996, initiated the Court of Federal Claims Case.

On March 5, 1999, the United States District Court (the Court), entered a
“Final Judgment” against First Heights and PDCI resolving by summary judgment
in favor of the FDIC most of the FDIC’s claims against the Pulte Parties. The
Final Judgment required PDCI and First Heights to pay the FDIC monetary damages
totaling approximately $221.3 million, including interest but excluding costs
(such as attorneys fees) to be determined in the future by the District Court
and post-judgment interest. However, the FDIC acknowledged that it had already
paid itself or withheld from assistance its obligation to pay to First Heights
approximately $105 million, excluding interest thereon. We believed that we
were entitled to a credit or actual payment of such amount plus interest. The
Final Judgment did not address this issue. We disagreed with the District
Court’s rulings and appealed the decision to the Sixth Circuit Court of
Appeals.

On October 12, 2000, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals rendered its
opinion in which it affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded the case to
the District Court for further proceedings. The Sixth Circuit affirmed most of
the District Court’s adverse liability rulings, including as to the sharing of
certain tax benefits achieved in connection with First Heights’ 1988
acquisition and ownership of the five failed Texas thrifts and regarding the
Company’s and First Heights’ amendment of a tax sharing and allocation
agreement and rescission of a warrant assumption agreement between PDCI and
First Heights. The Sixth Circuit, however, vacated the District Court’s damage
calculations as to a number of issues, vacated the District Court’s
pre-judgment interest award, and remanded to the District Court for a proper
recalculation of all such amounts. Although the Sixth Circuit opinion left
certain significant issues to be resolved through further Court proceedings,
based upon its reading of the Sixth Circuit opinion, we determined that an
after-tax charge of $30 million to Discontinued Operations was appropriate in
2000.

In October 2001, the FDIC and the Pulte Parties settled the District Court
Case, the related appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and the third
lawsuit. As part of this settlement (the “Settlement”), the Pulte Parties
agreed to pay to the FDIC $41.5 million, and the FDIC was permitted to retain
all amounts previously withheld from First Heights including the FRF notes (see
Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, the First
Heights Assistance Agreement was terminated, except certain tax benefit sharing
provisions will continue in effect, and the warrants issued by First Heights to
the FDIC were extinguished. We do not believe that the claims in the Court of
Federal Claims Case are in any way prejudiced by the Settlement.



ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (continued)

First Heights-related litigation (continued)

In the Court of Federal Claims Case, the Pulte Parties assert breaches of
contract on the part of the United States in connection with the enactment of
Section 13224 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (“OBRA”). That
provision repealed portions of the tax benefits that the Pulte Parties claim
they were entitled to under the contract to acquire the failed Texas thrifts.
The Pulte Parties also assert another claim concerning the contract that the
United States (through the FDIC as receiver) improperly attempted to amend the
failed thrifts’ pre-acquisition tax returns and that this attempt was made in
an effort to deprive the Pulte Parties of tax benefits for which they had
contracted.

On August 17, 2001, the United States Court of Federal Claims ruled that
the United States government is liable to the Company for breach of contract by
enacting Section 13224 of OBRA. The Court will now proceed to determine the
amount of damages to which the Pulte Parties are entitled. While it is unclear
at this time what amount the Court will award, the Pulte Parties are currently
seeking approximately $80 million in after tax damages for the United States
government’s breach of contract.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview:

A summary of our operating results by business segment for the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 is as follows ($000’s omitted, except per
share data):

A comparison of pre-tax income (loss), for the years ended December 31,
2001, 2000 and 1999 is as follows:

•

Pre-tax income of our homebuilding business segment increased 33% in
2001 and 24% in 2000. Results in 2001 reflect a 9% increase in average
selling price to $225,000 and a 120 basis point improvement in gross
margin to 20%. Our 2001 results also reflect five months of the
acquired operations of Del Webb Corporation as this merger was completed
on July 31, 2001 (please see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements). Compared to 1999, our 2000 results primarily reflect a 10%
increase in domestic average selling price to $206,000 and a 100 basis
point improvement in gross margins.

•

Pre-tax income of $28,331,000 for our financial services business
segment represents an increase of 49% over 2000 due to increased loan
originations and secondary marketing gains resulting from a favorable
interest rate environment. Del Webb’s mortgage operations also
contributed to this increase. Pre-tax income decreased 9% in 2000 from
1999 to $19,009,000. Pre-tax income for 2000 was impacted by
competitive market conditions due to higher interest rates early in the
year, which reduced profitability. Results for 1999 also reflect a net
gain of approximately $1,700,000 in connection with the sale of the
mortgage-backed securities by Pulte Financial Companies, Inc., one of our
subsidiaries.

•

Pre-tax loss of our corporate business segment increased $1,156,000
in 2001 from $56,296,000 in 2000 as an increase in net interest expense,
primarily due to the inclusion of Del Webb’s debt, was partially offset
by lower Corporate expenditures. In 2000, our pre-tax loss increased
$5,312,000 from $50,984,000 in 1999 reflecting an increase in net
interest expense.



ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Homebuilding Operations:

Our homebuilding operations are organized into two distinct business
units: Domestic and International.

•

Domestic Homebuilding operations are conducted in 43 markets, located
throughout 25 states. Domestic Homebuilding offers a broad product line
to meet the needs of the first-time, first and second move-up, and
active adult homebuyers.

•

International Homebuilding operations are conducted through
subsidiaries of Pulte International Corporation in Mexico, Puerto Rico
and Argentina. International Homebuilding product offerings focus on
the demand of first-time buyers, and social interest housing in Mexico
and Puerto Rico. Housing for middle-to-upper income consumer groups is
also available in Puerto Rico and Argentina. We have agreements in
place with multi-national corporations to provide social interest
housing in Mexico.

Certain operating data relating to our homebuilding operations and our
joint ventures are as follows ($000’s omitted):



ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Homebuilding Operations (continued):

Domestic Homebuilding:

The Domestic Homebuilding business unit represents our core business.
Operations are conducted in 43 markets, located throughout 25 states, and are
organized into five groups as follows:

Northeast:

Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia

Southeast:

Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee

Midwest:

Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio

Central:

Colorado, Texas

West:

Arizona, California, Nevada

The metropolitan Atlanta market accounted for 10% of the total unit
settlements in 2000. No other individual market represented more than 10% of
total Domestic Homebuilding net new orders, unit settlements or revenues during
the three years ended December 31, 2001.

The following table presents selected unit information for our Domestic
Homebuilding operations:



ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Homebuilding Operations (continued):

Domestic Homebuilding (continued):

Net new orders increased for the thirteenth consecutive year to an
all-time record of 26,116 units in 2001, a 32% increase over 2000 order levels.
This increase is primarily due to the inclusion of Del Webb’s operations,
which contributed 5,968 units, including an acquired backlog of 3,823 units.
Order growth in the Central and West groups offset by softer performance in the
Northeast and Midwest groups contributed to a 2% increase in 2000 orders over
1999 levels.

Unit settlements in 2001 also hit a record-setting high, to 22,915 units
with the majority of the increase due to the inclusion of Del Webb’s
operations, which contributed 2,797 units. Unit settlement activity in 2000
increased 1% over 1999 levels reflecting strong performance in the Southeast,
Central and West groups offset by a decline in the Northeast. The average home
sales price increased from $187,000 in 1999 to $206,000 in 2000 and to $225,000
in the current year. Changes in average selling price reflect a number of
factors, including price increases, the mix of product closed during a period
and the number of options purchased by customers. 2001 benefited from
increased product prices, improved product mix and the inclusion of Del Webb
product offerings, which had an average selling price of $264,000.

Ending backlog, which represents orders for homes that have not yet
closed, jumped 58% to 8,678 homes, including 3,171 Del Webb units, while the
dollar value was up 62% to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2001. Unit backlog at
December 31, 2000, was slightly higher than that noted at the end of 1999 while
the dollar value was up 11%. Overall, strong demand supported by a favorable
interest rate environment and the addition of Del Webb’s operations drove
increased order activity and record levels of backlog.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Homebuilding Operations (continued):

Domestic Homebuilding (continued):

Gross profit margins in 2001 increased 120 basis points over 2000 to
20.0%, including the effect of purchase accounting associated with the Del Webb
merger. Excluding the effect of purchase accounting, gross margins in 2001
would have been 20.2%. Gross profit margins in 2000 increased to 18.8%, up 100
basis points over 1999. Factors that contributed to this favorable trend
include strong customer demand, positive home pricing, the benefits of
leverage-buy purchasing activities and effective production and inventory
management.

Land sales increased over each of the prior three years representing our
land development core competency which includes development and entitlement of
certain land positions for sale primarily to other homebuilders, as well as to
retail and commercial establishments. Revenues and their related gains/losses
may vary significantly between periods, depending on the timing of future land
sales. We continue to rationalize certain existing land positions to ensure
the most effective use of invested capital.

For the year ended December 31, 2001, selling, general and administrative
expenses (SG&A), as a percentage of home settlement revenues, increased 42
basis points to 9.37% after increasing 35 basis points to 8.95% in 2000.
Higher startup costs for new communities, increased compensation related costs,
local market advertising expenses and the inclusion of Del Webb’s operations
are the primary reasons for the increase in 2001. The increase in 2000
reflects higher sales and marketing expenses, and startup costs associated with
the opening of new communities.

Other expense, net increased to $16,851,000 in 2001 as a result of
increased land inventory valuation reserves for certain land positions and
amortization of tradenames and trademarks acquired in the merger with Del Webb.
The increase from 1999 to 2000 represents an increase in various market level
non-operational expenditures.

Our Domestic Homebuilding operations controlled approximately 116,000 and
74,900 lots, of which approximately 81,200 and 40,800 lots were owned, and
approximately 34,800 and 34,100 lots were controlled through option agreements
at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Domestic Homebuilding inventory
at December 31, 2001, was approximately $3.7 billion of which $2.8 billion is
related to land and land development. At December 31, 2000, inventory was
approximately $1.8 billion of which $1.3 billion was related to land and land
development. Included in other assets is approximately $223.5 million in land
held for disposition as of December 31, 2001, as compared to $88.3 million in
the prior year.

International Homebuilding:

International Homebuilding operations are primarily conducted through
subsidiaries of Pulte International Corporation (International) in Mexico,
Puerto Rico and Argentina.

Mexico

International’s 100%-owned subsidiary, Pulte International-Mexico,
Inc., conducts its operations primarily through five joint ventures located
throughout Mexico. Its net investment in these joint ventures approximated
$47.7 million at December 31, 2001. The largest of these ventures,
Condak-Pulte S. De R.L. De C.V. (Condak-Pulte), is based in Cuidad Juarez.
Condak-Pulte is currently developing communities in Juarez, Chihuahua, Nuevo
Laredo, Monterrey, Reynosa, Saltillo and Matamoros, under agreements with
Delphi Automotive Systems, Gigante, S.A. de C.V. and Centro Comerciales
Soriana, S.A. De C. V. As of December 31, 2001, International’s net investment
in Condak-Pulte approximated $38.9 million.

Desarrollos Residenciales Turisticos, S.A. de C.V., another of its joint
ventures in Mexico, is constructing primarily social interest housing in
Central Mexico. Current development plans for this venture include housing
projects in the Bajio region surrounding Mexico City, targeting the cities of
Celaya, Leon, Puebla, Queretaro, San Jose du Iturbide and San Juan del Rio. At
December 31, 2001, International’s net investment in this joint venture
approximated $7.2 million.

Effective January 1, 2002, Pulte International reorganized its structure
within Mexico to create a single company, Pulte Mexico, which ranks as one of
the largest builders in the country. The new operating structure will
facilitate growth, enable operating leverage and improve efficiencies through
standardized systems and procedures. The new company, which combines several
entities, including Condak-Pulte and DRT, will be consolidated into our
financial statements.



ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Homebuilding Operations (continued):

International Homebuilding (continued):

Puerto Rico

Operations in Puerto Rico are primarily conducted through
International’s 100%-owned subsidiary, Pulte International Caribbean
Corporation. Desarrolladores Urbanos (Canovanas), S.E., its Puerto Rican joint
venture, is developing 121 acres located in Metropolitan San Juan. At December
31, 2001, its net investment in this joint venture approximated $3.8 million.

Argentina

Operations in Argentina are conducted through Pulte SRL,
International’s 100%-owned Argentine subsidiary which recorded its first
closings during the second quarter of 2001.

The following table presents selected financial data for Pulte’s
International Homebuilding operations for the years ended December 31, 2001,
2000 and 1999 ($000’s omitted):

Increased revenues in 2001 are due to the opening of operations in
Argentina and a higher average selling price for our Puerto Rican operations.
The higher average selling price in Puerto Rico, which results from
concentrating more in middle-market housing than in social interest housing,
was offset by a decrease in closings from 264 in 2000 to 176 in 2001.
Increased revenues in 2000 from 1999 are also attributable to this shift in
focus. Results in 1999 benefited from a $2,400,000 land sale gain. SG&A
expense increased $6,199,000 in 2001 as a result of the start-up of the
Argentine operations. The Argentine operations recorded a $463,000 foreign
currency transaction loss in 2001 as a result of the Argentine government’s
decision to de-link the valuation of the Argentine peso from the U. S. dollar.
We also recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $14,110,000, net of
income taxes of $8,833,000, as a component of other comprehensive income in
2001. It is unclear at this time how the Argentine financial and currency
markets will be affected in 2002. It is also unclear how the current economic
situation may affect customer homebuying attitudes and the homebuilding
business in general.

In 2001, the Mexican operations were affected by changes in government
lending practices, which slowed mortgage funding, resulting in lower closings
than in 2000. It is anticipated that the rate of mortgage funding in Mexico
will accelerate in 2002, which should increase the pace of closings over what
was experienced in 2001. Our Mexican joint venture operations recorded 7,718
closings in 2000, representing a 19% increase over comparable 1999 results.
Our share of pre-tax income of $5,455,000 for 2000 for the Mexican joint
ventures was slightly lower than the $6,000,000 recorded in 1999 as earnings in
1999 included currency gains of $1,702,000 versus currency losses of $78,000
for 2000. Currency losses in Mexico amounted to $378,000 in 2001. Eliminating
the impact of the currency gains and losses, operating income for our Mexican
operations increased by approximately 29% in 2000.



ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Financial Services Operations:

We conduct our financial services operations principally through Pulte
Mortgage Corporation (PMC), our mortgage banking subsidiary and during 1999,
through Pulte Financial Companies, Inc. (PFCI). Pre-tax income of our
financial services operations is as follows ($000’s omitted):

Mortgage Banking:

We sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing
sales contracts. Due to the short period of time the servicing rights are
held, usually three to four months, we do not amortize the servicing asset.
Since the servicing rights are recorded at the value in the servicing sales
contracts, there are no impairment issues related to these assets. We also
originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available
through various credit arrangements, and then sell such mortgage loans to
outside investors.

Mortgage origination principal volume for the year ended December 31,
2001, increased 50% over 2000, which benefited from an increase in the capture
rate of 400 basis points to 60%, an increased average loan size and the
inclusion of Del Webb’s mortgage operations, which accounted for approximately
13% of the increase. Origination unit volume increased 42% due to the same
factors. Mortgage origination principal volume in 2000 increased 3% over 1999,
due to increases in year-to-date unit sales and higher average selling prices
realized in our Domestic Homebuilding operations. However, the number of loans
for 2000 was down 2% from 1999 levels due to competitive market conditions and
rising mortgage interest rates during the last six months of 1999 and first
three quarters of 2000. Our home buying customers continue to account for the
majority of total loan production, representing 79% of total PMC unit
production for 2001, compared with 83% in 2000 and 79% in 1999. Refinancings
represented 10% of total loan production in 2001, compared with 2% in 2000 and
4% during 1999. At December 31, 2001, loan application backlog increased 54%
to $827 million as compared to $536 million and $499 million at December 31,
2000 and 1999, respectively.



ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Financial Services Operations (continued):

Mortgage Banking (continued):

Pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased 49% to
$28.3 million, due to increases in volume, capture rate and secondary marketing
gains. The addition of Del Webb’s mortgage operations for the last five months
of 2001 contributed approximately 8% of this increase. Pricing and marketing
gains increased $17.4 million, or 71%, from the same period in 2000, primarily
due to a consistent drop in interest rates throughout 2001. As compared with
2000, net interest income increased $3.1 million to $5.0 million during 2001
due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the drop
in interest rates during 2001. Offsetting these gains was an increase in SG&A
expenses of $10 million as a result of increased headcount and other related
costs due to the increase in volume during 2001.

Pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2000, was unchanged from
1999, as increases in origination fees and other income were offset by
decreases in pricing and marketing gains and net interest income. During 2000,
origination fees increased $1.6 million, or 23%, over the prior year due
primarily to an increase in brokered loans. Pricing and marketing gains
decreased $3.6 million, or 13%, from the same period in 1999, primarily due to
competitive market conditions for much of 2000. As compared with 1999, net
interest income decreased 17% to $1.8 million during 2000 as a result of a drop
in funded production and a higher cost of funds due to a new warehouse line
that became effective March 31, 2000. During 2000, we recognized increased
equity income from our minority interest in a Mexican mortgage banking company,
and also recognized income from mortgage reinsurance operations.

Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended by Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 138, “Accounting for Certain
Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities,” requires companies to
recognize all of their derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities
in the statement of financial position at fair value. The accounting for
changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument
depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging
relationship, and further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those
derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments,
a company must designate the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being
hedged, as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge.

We hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed
mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments. For the year ended
December 31, 2001, we did not recognize any net gains or losses related to the
ineffective portion of the hedging instrument excluded from the assessment of
hedge effectiveness. We also did not recognize any gains or losses during
2001, for cash flow hedges that were discontinued because it is probable that
the original forecasted transaction will not occur. At December 31, 2001, we
expect to reclassify $592,000, net of taxes, of net losses on derivative
instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the
next twelve months from sales of closed mortgage loans.

Financing Activities:

Our secured financing operations, which were conducted by a
limited-purpose subsidiary of PFCI, ceased operations during 1999. During the
first quarter of 1999, we recognized a net gain of approximately $1.7 million
in connection with the sale of its remaining mortgage-backed securities
portfolio.



ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Corporate:

Corporate is a non-operating business segment whose primary purpose is to
support the operations of our subsidiaries as the internal source of financing,
to develop and implement strategic initiatives centered on new business
development and operating efficiencies, and to provide the administrative
support associated with being a publicly traded entity. As a result, the
corporate segment’s operating results will vary from year to year as these
strategic initiatives evolve.

The following table presents this segment’s results of operations ($000’s

An increase in net interest expense offset by a decrease in other
corporate expenses, net, resulted in a 2% increase in the net loss for the
Corporate segment. The increase in the corporate net interest spread, which is
net of interest capitalized into inventory, is attributable to a higher debt
balance as a result of the Del Webb merger and the issuance in February 2001 of
$200 million and in August 2001 of $500 million in Senior Notes, primarily for
use in repaying certain indebtedness acquired from Del Webb (see “Del Webb
Merger”). The decrease in other corporate expenses, net in 2001 is primarily
due to the effect of the write-down of a commercial land position in 2000. The
increase in 2000 of the pre-tax loss to $56.3 million was primarily a result of
an increase in net interest expense. Increases in net interest expense were
attributed to higher average use of our unsecured revolving credit facility in
addition to the April 2000 issuance of $175 million Senior Notes. Interest
incurred for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, excluding
interest incurred by our financial services operations, was approximately
$116.9, $62.8 and $49.5 million, respectively.

Corporate net interest expense is net of amounts capitalized into
homebuilding inventories. Interest is amortized to homebuilding interest
expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our
communities. Interest in inventory at December 31, 2001, increased primarily
as a result of higher levels of indebtedness and the addition of the Del Webb
properties, which have a longer life cycle. Information related to Corporate
interest capitalized into inventory is as follows ($000’s omitted):

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Liquidity and Capital Resources:

Continuing Operations:

Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31,
2001, was $418,796,000 as higher net income was offset by increases in
inventory and residential mortgage loans available-for-sale over 2000 and the
resolution of the First Heights litigation. Net cash provided by investing
activities in 2001 increased primarily due to the net cash acquired from Del
Webb. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was $297,131,000 as
proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes of $200 million and $500 million,
and increased borrowings under the revolving credit arrangements, were offset
by the repayment of debt acquired from Del Webb (see “Del Webb Merger”).

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31,
2000, amounted to $23,322,000. Increases in inventory, other assets, accounts
payable and accrued liabilities during 2000 were less than during 1999, and
were offset by a larger increase in residential mortgage loans
available-for-sale. Net cash used in investing activities was $5,185,000 for
2000. The effects of PFCI’s sale of the underlying collateral of its
mortgage-backed securities portfolio and the purchase of BRE’s interest in the
net assets of our active adult joint venture are reflected in 1999. Net cash
provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2000, was
$114,051,000, as compared to a use of cash of $87,642,000 in 1999. These
increased cash flows primarily reflect our issuance of $175 million Senior
Notes in April 2000 and issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock
option plans, offset by stock repurchases.

We finance homebuilding land acquisition, development and construction
activities from internally generated funds and existing credit agreements. We
had $110 million outstanding under our $560 million unsecured revolving credit
facilities at December 31, 2001. PMC provides mortgage financing for many of
our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available through
various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements which, at December 31,
2001, amounted to $450 million, an amount deemed adequate to cover foreseeable
needs. There were approximately $410 million of borrowings outstanding under
the PMC arrangements at December 31, 2001. Mortgage loans originated by PMC are
subsequently sold. We anticipate that there will be adequate mortgage
financing available for purchasers of our homes.

In February 2001, we sold $200 million of 8 1/8% Senior Notes, due 2011
from an active $500 million shelf registration. The net proceeds from the sale
of the Senior Notes were used to repay short-term borrowings under our
revolving bank credit arrangements and for general corporate purposes.

In August 2001, we sold in a private placement, $500 million of 7 7/8%
Senior Notes due in 2011 and subsequently filed an S-4 Registration Statement
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in December 2001. Net proceeds
received from the sale were used to repay certain indebtedness acquired in the
Del Webb transaction, to pay certain expenses associated with that transaction
and for general corporate purposes.

Our income tax liabilities are affected by a number of factors. In 2001,
our effective tax rate was 38.50% compared to 38.50% in 2000 and 37.75% in
1999. Our lower effective income tax rate in 1999 resulted from a lower
effective state tax rate and the favorable resolution of various state income
tax matters. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2002 will be
approximately 39%.

At December 31, 2001, we had cash and equivalents of $72.1 million and
total long-term indebtedness of $1.7 billion. Our total long-term indebtedness
includes $1.4 billion of unsecured Senior Notes, $368.6 million of unsecured
Senior Subordinated Notes, other limited recourse debt of $15 million and other
non-recourse short-term notes payable of $60.7 million.

Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are used to guarantee our
performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the
development of our projects. The expiration dates of the letter of credit
contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related project.
If the obligations related to the project are ongoing, annual extensions are
granted on a year-to-year basis. Performance bonds do not have stated
expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual
performance is completed. These bonds, which approximated $775 million at
December 31, 2001, are typically outstanding over a period that approximates
3-5 years.

In the normal course of business, we acquire rights under options or
option-type agreements to purchase land to be used in homebuilding operations
at future dates. These rights, which may be cancelled at our discretion, may
extend over several years and are typically secured by small deposits.
Further, these rights are frequently extended or renegotiated to better match
the needs of our homebuilding operations. The total purchase price applicable
to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future
dates approximated $1.1 billion at December 31, 2001, which represented
approximately 35,000 lots. In addition, there were approximately 25,000 lots
valued at $644 million under option at December 31, 2001, pending approval,
that are under review and evaluation for future use by our homebuilding
operations.

Sources of our working capital at December 31, 2001, include our cash and
equivalents, our $560 million committed unsecured revolving credit facilities
and PMC’s $450 million revolving credit facilities. Our debt-to-total
capitalization, excluding our non-guarantor asset secured borrowings, was 44.8%
as of December 31, 2001. We expect to manage our debt-to-total capitalization
to the 40% level by the end of 2002. It is our intent to exercise, over time,
the early call provisions of the Senior Subordinated Notes issued by Del Webb,
as allowed under these notes. We routinely monitor current operational
requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate the use of available
financial sources, including securities offerings.



ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued):

Del Webb Merger:

On July 31, 2001, we merged with Del Webb Corporation as discussed in Note
3 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. At closing, we paid off
and cancelled Del Webb’s revolving credit facility, which had a balance
outstanding of approximately $300 million at closing. Under the terms of Del
Webb’s $100 million, 9 3/4%, due 2003, Senior Subordinated Notes, we
exercised our option to redeem the entire bond issuance at par during the third
quarter of 2001. Under the terms of Del Webb’s other Senior Subordinated
Notes, we were required, as a result of the change in control, to offer to
purchase four series of its Senior Subordinated Notes. As of December 31,
2001, we had repurchased, through tender offers and open-market purchases, $127
million of these Notes. Under the terms of Del Webb’s $150 million 9 3/4%,
due 2008, Senior Subordinated Notes, we exercised our optional right to redeem
the remaining outstanding balance of $122 million at the price stipulated in
the indenture by placing with the trustee as of December 31, 2001, sufficient
proceeds to satisfy a January 15, 2002, final payoff.

Inflation:

We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected
during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs.
Inflation also increases our financing, labor and material costs. In
addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability
of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass
our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. To
date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of
operations. However, there is no assurance that inflation will not have a
material adverse impact on our future results of operations.

Critical Accounting Policies:

The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is
generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in
our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make
estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result,
actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial
statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and
disclosures included in the financial statements, giving due regard to
materiality.

Inventory valuation:

Our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated cost or
net realizable value. Included in inventories are all direct development
costs. We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge
the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates
the average life cycle of our communities. This period increased in 2001 due
to the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle.
Inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated
cost, unless they are determined to be impaired, in which case these
inventories are measured at fair value. If actual market conditions are less
favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments
may be required.

Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis or on a
relative sales value basis as cost of sales. Under the specific identification
basis, units are assigned an average cost by project based on actual
costs-to-date plus the estimated cost of completion. Units costed using the
relative sales value basis are assigned cost based on the sales value of the
unit in relation to the total estimated sales value of the project.



ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Critical Accounting Policies (continued):

Goodwill and Intangible Assets:

Goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed by management for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may
not be recoverable. Goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $467 million
at the end of 2001, which represented 8% of total assets. The majority of
these assets resulted from the acquisition of Del Webb in 2001. Del Webb has a
long history of operating success and profitability, has well recognized brand
names and holds a significant position in the active adult market which should
continue in the future. The integration of Del Webb should enable the combined
businesses to accelerate the pace of land absorptions, enhance the visibility
of the “Del Webb” and “Sun City” brand names and obtain the synergies of
enhanced purchasing leverage, complementary product offerings and combined
operations in the future. Changes in strategy and/or market conditions could
impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are subject to interest rate risk on our long-term debt to the extent
long-term rates decline. The following tables set forth, as of December 31,

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued)

PMC, operating as a mortgage banker, is also subject to interest rate
risk. Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at
agreed upon terms (i.e., commits to lend at a certain interest rate for a
certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through the loan
closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2001 and 2000, this
period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of
rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to
customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest
rate float.

We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable
rate borrowing agreement tied to the Federal Funds rate and (ii) hedging our
loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments with
off-balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include cash forward
placement contracts on mortgage-backed securities, whole loan investor
commitments, options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward
placement contracts on mortgage-backed securities. We do not use any
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments
arising from immediate parallel shifts in long-term mortgage rates of plus 50,
100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results.

Our aggregate net equity investment in Mexico approximated $61.1 million
at December 31, 2001. This investment, which is exposed to foreign currency
exchange risk, could devalue by as much as $10 million in 2002, assuming a
hypothetical 18% annualized devaluation of the Mexican peso against the U.S.
dollar during 2002.

Our aggregate net investment in Argentina approximated $20.1 million at
December 31, 2001. This investment is exposed to foreign currency exchange
risk. It is unclear at this time how the Argentine financial and currency
markets will be affected in 2002 as a result of the Argentine government’s
decision to de-link the valuation of the Argentine peso from the U. S. dollar.
It is therefore unclear what effect this may have on the continuing value of
our investment in Argentina.

SPECIAL NOTES CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

As a cautionary note, except for the historical information contained
herein, certain matters discussed in Item 7., “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Item 7A.,
“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” are
“forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such matters involve risks and uncertainties,
including:

•

our exposure to certain market risks, changes in economic conditions,
tax and interest rates, increases in raw material and labor costs,
issues and timing surrounding land entitlement and development, weather
conditions, government regulations and environmental matters, as well
as, general competitive factors, that may cause actual results to differ
materially; and

•

our ability to integrate the recently acquired business operations of
Del Webb Corporation, including Del Webb’s activities, management and
corporate culture, with our own, and our ability to develop and manage
large-scale active adult communities which differ from our historical
homebuilding business.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Basis of presentation and significant accounting policies

Basis of presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pulte
Homes, Inc. (the “Company” or “Pulte”), and all of its direct subsidiaries.
The Company’s direct subsidiaries include Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc.
(PDCI), Del Webb Corporation (Del Webb) and other subsidiaries, which are
engaged in the homebuilding business. PDCI’s operating subsidiaries include
Pulte Home Corporation (PHC), Pulte International Corporation (International)
and other subsidiaries, which are engaged in the homebuilding business.
PDCI’s non-operating thrift subsidiary, First Heights Bank, fsb (First
Heights), is classified as a discontinued operation (See Note 4). The
Company also has a mortgage banking company, Pulte Mortgage Company (PMC),
which is a subsidiary of PHC.

Certain amounts related to land sales previously reported in the 2000
financial statements and notes thereto were reclassified to conform to the
2001 presentation.

Significant accounting policies

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Cash and equivalents

For purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, commercial
paper and time deposits with a maturity of three months or less when acquired
are classified as cash equivalents.

Stock based compensation

The Company grants stock options to key employees for a fixed number of
shares with an exercise price not less than the fair value of the shares at
the date of grant. The Company accounts for the stock option grants in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees.” No compensation expense is recognized because
all stock options granted have exercise prices equal to the market value of
the Company’s stock on the date of the grant. The pro forma disclosures
required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” are included in Note 7.

Foreign investments

The Company has investments in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Argentina. Gains
and losses resulting from the change in foreign exchange rates are recognized
in accordance with SFAS No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation.” The Company
recorded losses of $841,000 and $78,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001
and 2000, respectively. The Company recorded a $1,702,000 gain on foreign
currency transactions for the year ended December 31, 1999.

The Company’s investments primarily include the Mexican homebuilding
joint ventures of Condak-Pulte S. De R.L. De C.V. and Desarrollos
Residenciales Turisticos, S.A. de C.V., the net investments of which comprise
$38.9 million and $7.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2001. The
Company recorded equity income of $5,138,000, $5,455,000 and $6,000,000
related to its Mexican homebuilding operations in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. To support homebuilding activities in Mexico, the Company also
has a minority ownership interest (approximately 21.9%) in a Mexican mortgage
banking company, the balance of which approximated $13.4 million at December
31, 2001. The Company’s aggregate net equity investment in the Mexican joint
ventures is approximately $61.1 million as of December 31, 2001.



PULTE HOMES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Basis of presentation and significant accounting policies (continued)

Income per share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to
common shareholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of common
shares, adjusted for nonvested shares of restricted stock (the denominator)
for the period. Computing diluted earnings per share is similar to basic
earnings per share, except that the denominator is increased to include the
dilutive effects of options, warrants and convertible securities. Any
options that have an exercise price greater than the average market price are
excluded from the diluted income per share calculation. For the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, 1,795,500, 873,000 and 2,623,000,
respectively, of the outstanding stock options were excluded from this
calculation.

Fair values of financial instruments

The estimated fair values of financial instruments were determined by
management using available market information and appropriate valuation
methodologies. Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret the market
data and develop the estimated fair value. Accordingly, the estimates
presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could
realize on disposition of the financial instruments. The use of different
market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect
on the estimated fair value amounts.

The carrying amounts of cash and equivalents approximate their fair
values due to their short-term nature.

The fair value of residential mortgage loans available-for-sale is
estimated using the quoted market prices for securities backed by similar
loans.

The fair values of Subordinated Debentures and Senior Notes are based on
quoted market prices, when available. If quoted market prices are not
available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of similar issues.

Disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments are based on
pertinent information available to management as of December 31, 2001.
Although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly
affect the reasonableness of the fair value amounts, such amounts were not
comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since
that date and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from
the amounts presented herein.

Advertising cost

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. For the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, the Company incurred advertising costs of
approximately $56,835,000, $40,440,000 and $31,800,000, respectively.

Employee benefits

The Company maintains two defined contribution plans that cover

Intangible assets

Intangible assets, which consist of goodwill and certain trademarks and
tradenames, are routinely reviewed for impairment indicators or when events
and circumstances warrant. If impairment indicators exist, an assessment of
undiscounted future cash flows for the assets related to these intangibles
are evaluated accordingly. If the results of the analysis indicate
impairment, the assets are adjusted to fair market value. Trademarks and
tradenames are amortized on a straight-line basis over a 20 year life.

Derivative instruments and hedging activities

Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended, requires
companies to recognize all of their derivative instruments as either assets
or liabilities at fair value in the statement of financial position. The
accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a
derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies
as part of a hedging relationship, and further, on the type of hedging
relationship. For those derivative instruments that are designated and
qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the hedging
instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as either a fair value
hedge or a cash flow hedge.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair
value hedge (i.e., hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an
asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to
a particular risk), the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as
the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged
risk are recognized in current earnings during the period of the change in
fair values. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a
cash flow hedge (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future
cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk), the effective portion
of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component
of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same
period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. For
derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the gain or
loss is recognized in current earnings during the period of change. The
Company currently uses only cash flow hedge accounting.

Market risks arise from movements in interest rates and cancelled or
modified commitments to lend. In order to reduce these risks, the Company
uses derivative financial instruments. These financial instruments include
cash forward placement contracts on mortgage-backed securities, whole loan
investor commitments, options on treasury futures contracts, and options on
cash forward placement contracts on mortgage-backed securities. The Company
does not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. When
the Company commits to lend to the borrower (interest rate is locked to the
borrower), the Company enters into one of the aforementioned derivative
financial instruments. The change in the value of the loan commitment and
the derivative financial instrument is recognized in current earnings during
the period of change.

The Company hedges portions of its forecasted cash flow from sales of
closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments. The cumulative
effect recognized in adopting this statement was not material to the Company
in 2001. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company did not recognize
any net gains or losses related to the ineffective portion of the hedging
instrument excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. In addition,
the Company did not recognize any gains or losses during 2001 for cash flow
hedges that were discontinued because it is probable that the original
forecasted transaction will not occur. At December 31, 2001, the Company
expects to reclassify $592,000, net of taxes, of net losses on derivative
instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during
the next twelve months from sales of closed mortgage loans.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, “Business
Combinations,” and No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Under the new rules,
goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment
tests in accordance with the SFAS No. 142. Other intangible assets will
continue to be amortized over their useful lives.

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company will apply the nonamortization
provisions of SFAS No. 142 related to the goodwill existing at June 30, 2001,
which is expected to result in an increase in net income of approximately $4
million ($0.07 per diluted share) per year. As required by SFAS No. 142, the
goodwill recorded as a result of the July 2001 merger with Del Webb (Note 3)
has not been amortized. During 2002, the Company will perform the first of
the required impairment tests of goodwill as of January 1, 2002, and has not
yet determined what the effect of these tests will be on the earnings and
financial position of the Company.

In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2001. This standard supersedes SFAS No. 121,
“Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets
to Be Disposed Of,” and provides a single accounting model for long-lived
assets to be disposed of. SFAS No. 144 provides guidance on differentiating
between assets held and used and assets to be disposed of. Assets to be
disposed of would be classified as held for sale (and depreciation would
cease) when management, having the authority to approve the action, commits
to a plan to sell the asset(s) meeting all required criteria. The Company
plans to adopt this statement on January 1, 2002, but has not yet determined
what effect, if any, SFAS No. 144 will have on its earnings and financial
position.

Homebuilding

Allowance for warranties

Home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building
defects. Estimated warranty cost is provided in the period in which the sale
is recorded.

Start-up costs

Costs and expenses associated with entry into new homebuilding markets
and opening new communities in existing markets are expensed when incurred.

Revenues

Homebuilding revenues are recorded when the sales of homes are completed
and ownership has transferred to the customer. Unfunded settlements are
deposits in transit on homes for which the sale was completed.

Inventories

Finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated cost or net
realizable value. Inventories under development or held for development are
stated at accumulated cost, unless certain facts indicate such cost would not
be recovered from the cash flows generated by future disposition. In this
instance, such inventories are measured at fair value.

Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis or on a
relative sales value basis as cost of sales. Included in inventories are all
direct costs specifically identifiable to its development. The Company
capitalizes interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charges the
interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the
average life cycle of its communities. The Company capitalized interest in
the amount of $80,399,000, $33,129,000 and $27,923,000, and expensed to
homebuilding interest expense $36,006,000, $28,019,000 and $25,187,000 in
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Financial Services

Mortgage servicing rights

The Company sells its servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed
price servicing sales contracts. Due to the short period of time the
servicing rights are held, usually three to four months, the Company does not
amortize the servicing asset. Since the servicing rights are recorded at the
value in the servicing sales contracts, there are no impairment issues
related to these assets. The Company could be required to repurchase loans
found to be defective. Reserves for such future repurchases or
indemnifications are reflected in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
During 2001, 2000 and 1999, total servicing rights recognized were
$41,614,000, $33,048,000 and $38,290,000, respectively.

Residential mortgage loans available-for-sale

Residential mortgage loans available-for-sale are stated at the lower of
aggregate cost or market value. Unamortized net mortgage discounts totaled
$1,827,000 and $1,119,000 at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the
loans are sold. The Company hedges its residential mortgage loans
available-for-sale (see Note 11). Gains and losses from closed commitments
and futures contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on the
sale of mortgage loans.

Mortgage servicing, origination and commitment fees

Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for
various investors. Servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of
the outstanding principal balance and are credited to income when the related
mortgage payments are received. Loan origination fees, commitment fees and
certain direct loan origination costs are deferred as an adjustment to the
cost of the related mortgage loan until such loan is sold.

2.

Segment information

The Company’s operations are classified into three reportable segments:
Homebuilding, Financial Services and Corporate.

The Company’s Homebuilding segment consists of the following two
business units:

•

Domestic Homebuilding, the Company’s core business, is engaged in the
acquisition and development of land primarily for residential purposes
within the continental United States and the construction of housing on
such land targeted for the first-time, first and second move-up, and
active adult home buyers.

•

International Homebuilding is primarily engaged in the acquisition
and development of land principally for residential purposes, and the
construction of housing on such land in Mexico, Puerto Rico and
Argentina.

The Company’s Financial Services segment consists principally of
mortgage banking operations conducted through PMC and its subsidiaries.

Corporate is a non-operating business segment whose primary purpose is
to support the operations of the Company’s subsidiaries as the internal
source of financing, to develop and implement strategic initiatives centered
on new business development and operating efficiencies, and to provide the
necessary administrative functions to support the Company as a publicly
traded entity.

Del Webb Merger

On July 31, 2001, the Company merged with Del Webb Corporation in a
tax-free stock-for-stock transaction. Under the terms of the merger
agreement, each outstanding share of Del Webb common stock was exchanged for
approximately 0.894 shares of newly issued Company stock. Approximately
16,800,000 shares were issued to Del Webb shareholders. Del Webb is
primarily a homebuilder with operations in six states. For the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2001, Del Webb reported net income of $91.2 million on
revenues of $1.9 billion and 7,038 unit settlements. Backlog reported at
June 30, 2001 was 3,682 units valued at approximately $994 million.

This merger expands and supports the Company’s leadership position. In
particular, the Company believes the merger will strengthen its position
among active adult homebuyers, enhance its overall land position, provide
operational savings from economies of scale while enhancing purchasing
leverage, and enhance the Company’s overall competitive position.

The merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
Approximately 16,800,000 shares were issued and assigned an approximate
accounting value of $42.74 per share based on the average closing price of
the Company’s stock for the five trading days ended July 26, 2001. The

This goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes, was allocated

appraisers and advisors utilizing proven valuation procedures allocated
portions of the purchase price, including inventory, intangible assets and
various other assets. The final determination of purchase accounting is
subject to the resolution of certain issues related to assumed liabilities.

Del Webb’s operations have been included in the consolidated results
since August 1, 2001. The following table presents a summary of the
unaudited pro forma operating results for the Company assuming that the
merger with Del Webb occurred on January 1, 2001 and 2000.

The pro forma information presented does not purport to be indicative of
the results of operations that would have actually been reported had the
merger occurred on January 1, 2001 and 2000. For the purposes of the above
pro-forma information presented and in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,”
goodwill is not amortized for transactions occurring subsequent to June 30,
2001. As such, operations for all periods presented do not include
amortization of the goodwill recognized in the Del Webb merger.

Discontinued operations

In September 1988, substantially all of the assets, business operations
and certain liabilities of five Texas-based insolvent thrifts were acquired
by First Heights. Assistance with each acquisition was provided by the
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) pursuant to an
Assistance Agreement. The FSLIC issued promissory notes representing the
estimated negative net worth of the acquired associations at the date of
acquisition, the balances of which, including accrued interest, were $0 and
$81,035,000 at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The notes had a
weighted-average interest rate of 5.6% at December 31, 2000. The FSLIC
Resolution Fund (FRF) is entitled to payments of up to 25% of certain tax
benefits which may be derived as a result of the assistance transactions.

During the first quarter of 1994, the Company adopted a plan of disposal
for First Heights and announced its strategy to exit the thrift industry and
increase its focus on housing and related mortgage banking. First Heights
sold all but one of its 32 bank branches and related deposits to two
unrelated purchasers. The sale was substantially completed during the fourth
quarter of 1994, although the Company held brokered deposits which were not
liquidated until 1998.

Although the Company in 1994, expected to complete the plan of disposal
within a reasonable period of time, contractual disputes with the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) prevented the prepayment of the FRF
notes, thereby precluding the Company from completing the disposal in
accordance with its original plan. To provide liquidity for the sale, First
Heights liquidated its investment portfolios and its single-family
residential loan portfolio and, as provided in the Assistance Agreement,
entered into a Liquidity Assistance Note (LAN) with the FDIC acting in its
capacity as manager of the FRF. The LAN was collateralized by the FRF notes.
The LAN and FRF notes matured in September 1998; however, payment of these
obligations was withheld by both parties pending resolution of all open
matters with the FDIC. As discussed in Note 10, the Company settled its
litigation with the FDIC in October 2001, and, as part of the settlement, all
obligations under the LAN and the FRF notes have been extinguished.

First Heights no longer holds any deposits, nor does it maintain an
investment portfolio. First Heights’ day-to-day activities have been
principally devoted to supporting residual regulatory compliance matters and
the litigation with the United States government, and are not reflective of
the active operations of the former thrift, such as maintaining traditional
transaction accounts (e.g., checking and savings accounts) or making loans.
Accordingly, such operations are being presented as discontinued.

Included in accrued liabilities are litigation-related accruals recorded
by the Company, offset by accounts and notes receivable due from the FRF, of
$0 and $30,250,000 as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Revenues of discontinued operations were $29,000, $3,685,000 and
$3,677,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
discontinued thrift operations resulted in losses of $1,032,000, $29,871,000
and $122,000, respectively. The after tax loss in 2000 includes a $30
million charge for related litigation as discussed in Note 10.

Discontinued operations (continued)

The Company had previously recognized, as part of discontinued thrift
operations, after-tax income of approximately $110 million. Such income
related to tax benefits associated with net operating losses (NOLs), all of
which have now been utilized. Although the Company has computed its NOLs and
reported them to the Internal Revenue Service in a manner that it believes
will comply with applicable law, there is no assurance that the IRS will
agree with the Company’s determination of the amount of NOLs, in which case,
if the IRS were to prevail, the use of a portion or all of the Company’s NOLs
could be disallowed.

Short-term credit arrangements

Short-term financing for the Company on an operating segment basis is as follows:

Corporate/Homebuilding

In July 2001, the Company expanded its revolving credit facilities to a
total of $560 million as allowed under the credit agreements, in
contemplation of its acquisition of Del Webb. This facility, which includes
an option to expand the facility size to $600 million, expires August 31,

has a $225 million annual asset-backed commercial paper program, which
expires September 22, 2002. During the three years ended December 31, 2001,
PMC provided compensating balances, in the form of escrows and other
custodial funds, in order to further reduce interest rates. The bank credit
agreements each contain certain restrictions, including the maintenance of
levels of equity. Under the most restrictive of the agreements, PMC is
required to maintain a minimum tangible net worth of $15 million.

The Employee Plans provide for the grant of options (both non-qualified
options and incentive stock options as defined in each respective plan),
stock appreciation rights and restricted stock to key employees of the
Company or its subsidiaries (as determined by the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors) for periods not exceeding 10 years. Options granted
under the Employee Plans vest incrementally in periods ranging from six
months to five years. Under the Director Plans, each new nonemployee
director will receive 900 shares of common stock and options to purchase an
additional 4,000 shares. Nonemployee directors are also entitled to an
annual distribution of 900 shares of common stock and options to purchase an
additional 4,000 shares. All options granted are non-qualified, vest
immediately and are exercisable on the date of grant. Options granted under
the Director Plans are exercisable for 10 years from the grant date.

As a result of the Del Webb merger, the Company assumed Del Webb’s
employee stock plans and their director stock plans. No stock options remain
available for grant under the Del Webb plans.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions
used for grants in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively: weighted-average
dividend yields of .39%, .57% and .67%, expected volatility 34.8%, 34.5% and
30.5%, weighted-average risk-free interest rates of 4.94%, 5.54% and 5.48%,
and weighted-average expected lives of 6.97 years, 7.33 years and 7.27
years.

Stock compensation plans and management incentive compensation (continued)

Homebuilding operating management personnel are paid current cash
incentive compensation based on operating performance. Mortgage banking
management personnel are paid current cash incentive compensation
substantially based on the performance of the applicable subsidiary. The
Company’s corporate management personnel are paid current cash incentive
compensation based on overall performance of the Company. For the years
ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, the Company’s total current cash
incentive compensation expense was $70,605,000, $51,300,000 and $45,300,000,
respectively. The Company also utilizes a long-term cash incentive plan as a
means of compensating key operating employees for long-term performance and
contributions to the growth of the Company. For the years ended December 31,
2001, 2000 and 1999 the Company expensed $5,325,000, $2,300,000 and
$10,087,000, respectively, relating to this plan.

Income taxes

The Company’s net deferred tax asset is as follows ($000’s omitted):

The federal net operating loss (NOL) of $67,749,000 is subject to
certain limitations but is expected to be utilized fully by 2003. The state
NOLs of $72,190,000 expire in years 2006 through 2022 and are generally
available to offset the Company’s taxable income in future years.
Realization of the net deferred tax asset is dependent on future reversals of
existing taxable temporary differences and adequate future taxable income.
Although realization is not assured, management believes that, except for the
valuation allowance stated, it is more likely than not that the net deferred
tax asset will be realized.

Components of current and deferred income tax expense (benefit) of
continuing operations are as follows ($000’s omitted):

Leases

The Company leases certain property and equipment under non-cancelable
leases. Office and equipment leases are generally for terms of three to five
years and generally provide renewal options for terms of up to an additional
three years. Model home leases are generally for shorter terms approximating
one year with renewal options on a month-to-month basis. In most cases,
management expects that in the normal course of business, leases that expire
will be renewed or replaced by other leases. The future minimum lease
payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining
non-cancelable terms in excess of one year are as follows ($000’s omitted):

contain purchase options and generally provide that the Company shall pay for
insurance, taxes and maintenance.

Commitments and contingencies

In the normal course of business, Pulte acquires rights under options or
option-type agreements to purchase land to be used in homebuilding operations
at future dates. The total purchase price applicable to land under option
approximated $1.1 billion at December 31, 2001 and 2000.

At December 31, 2001, Pulte, in the normal course of business, had
outstanding letters of credit and performance bonds of $126 million and $775
million, respectively.

The Company is involved in various litigation incidental to its
continuing business operations. Management does not believe that this
litigation will have a material adverse impact on the results of operations,
financial position or cash flows of the Company.

Commitments and contingencies (continued)

First Heights-related litigation

The Company was a party to three lawsuits relating to First Heights’
1988 acquisition from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation
(FSLIC) and First Heights’ ownership of five failed Texas thrifts. The first
lawsuit (the “District Court Case”) was filed on July 7, 1995, in the United
States District Court, Eastern District of Michigan, by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) against the Company, PDCI and First Heights
(collectively, the “Pulte Parties”). The second lawsuit (the “Court of
Federal Claims Case”) was filed on December 26, 1996, in the United States
Court of Federal Claims (Washington, D.C.) by the Pulte Parties against the
United States. The third lawsuit was filed by First Heights on January 10,
2000, in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Michigan
against the FDIC regarding the amounts, including interest, the FDIC was
obligated to pay First Heights on two promissory notes which had been
executed by the FDIC’s predecessor, the FSLIC.

In the District Court Case, the FDIC, as successor to the FSLIC, sought
a declaration of rights and other relief related to the Assistance Agreement
entered into between First Heights and the FSLIC. The FDIC and the Pulte
Parties disagreed about the proper interpretation of provisions in the
Assistance Agreement which provide for sharing of certain tax benefits
achieved in connection with First Heights’ 1988 acquisition and ownership of
the five failed Texas thrifts. The District Court Case also included certain
other claims relating to the foregoing, including claims resulting from the
Company’s and First Heights’ amendment of a tax sharing and allocation
agreement between the Company and First Heights. The Pulte Parties disputed
the FDIC’s claims and filed an answer and a counterclaim, seeking, among
other things, a declaration that the FDIC had breached the Assistance
Agreement in numerous respects. On December 24, 1996, the Pulte Parties
voluntarily dismissed without prejudice certain of their claims in the
District Court Case and, on December 26, 1996, initiated the Court of Federal
Claims Case.

On March 5, 1999, the United States District Court (the Court), entered
a “Final Judgment” against First Heights and PDCI resolving by summary
judgment in favor of the FDIC most of the FDIC’s claims against the Pulte
Parties. The Final Judgment required PDCI and First Heights to pay the FDIC
monetary damages totaling approximately $221.3 million, including interest
but excluding costs (such as attorneys fees) to be determined in the future
by the District Court and post-judgment interest. However, the FDIC
acknowledged that it had already paid itself or withheld from assistance its
obligation to pay to First Heights approximately $105 million, excluding
interest thereon. The Company believed that it was entitled to a credit or
actual payment of such amount plus interest. The Final Judgment did not
address this issue. The Company disagreed with the District Court’s rulings
and appealed the decision to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.

On October 12, 2000, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals rendered its
opinion in which it affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded the case
to the District Court for further proceedings. The Sixth Circuit affirmed
most of the District Court’s adverse liability rulings, including as to the
sharing of certain tax benefits achieved in connection with First Heights’
1988 acquisition and ownership of the five failed Texas thrifts and regarding
the Company’s and First Heights’ amendment of a tax sharing and allocation
agreement and rescission of a warrant assumption agreement between PDCI and
First Heights. The Sixth Circuit, however, vacated the District Court’s
damage calculations as to a number of issues, vacated the District Court’s
pre-judgment interest award, and remanded to the District Court for a proper
recalculation of all such amounts. Although the Sixth Circuit opinion left
certain significant issues to be resolved through further Court proceedings,
based upon its reading of the Sixth Circuit opinion, the Company determined
that an after-tax charge of $30 million to Discontinued Operations was
appropriate in 2000.

In October 2001, the FDIC and the Pulte Parties settled the District
Court Case, the related appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and the
third lawsuit. As part of this settlement (the “Settlement”), the Pulte
Parties paid the FDIC $41.5 million, and the FDIC retained all amounts
previously withheld from First Heights including the FRF notes (see Note 4).
In addition, the First Heights Assistance Agreement was terminated, except
certain tax benefit sharing provisions will continue in effect, and the
warrants issued by First Heights to the FDIC were extinguished. The Company
does not believe that the claims in the Court of Federal Claims Case are in
any way prejudiced by the Settlement.

Commitments and contingencies (continued)

First Heights-related litigation (continued)

In the Court of Federal Claims Case, the Pulte Parties assert breaches
of contract on the part of the United States in connection with the enactment
of Section 13224 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (“OBRA”).
That provision repealed portions of the tax benefits that the Pulte Parties
claim they were entitled to under the contract to acquire the failed Texas
thrifts. The Pulte Parties also assert another claim concerning the contract
that the United States (through the FDIC as receiver) improperly attempted to
amend the failed thrifts’ pre-acquisition tax returns and that this attempt
was made in an effort to deprive the Pulte Parties of tax benefits for which
they had contracted.

On August 17, 2001, the United States Court of Federal Claims ruled that
the United States government is liable to the Company for breach of contract
by enacting Section 13224 of OBRA. The Court will now proceed to determine
the amount of damages to which the Pulte Parties are entitled. While it is
unclear at this time what amount the Court will award, the Pulte Parties are
currently seeking approximately $80 million in after tax damages for the
United States government’s breach of contract.

11.

Financial instruments, including those with off-balance sheet risk

Market risks arise from movements in interest rates and canceled or
modified commitments to lend. To reduce these risks, the Company uses
derivative financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. These
financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on
mortgage-backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on
treasury futures contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on
mortgage-backed securities. The Company does not use any derivative
financial instruments for trading purposes.

Cash forward placement contracts on mortgage-backed securities are
commitments to either purchase or sell a specified financial instrument at a
specified future date for a specified price and may be settled in cash by
offsetting the position, or through the delivery of the financial instrument.
Whole loan investor commitments are obligations of the investor to buy loans
at a specified price within a specified time period. Options on treasury
future contracts and options on mortgage-backed securities grant the
purchaser, for a premium payment, the right to either purchase or sell a
specified treasury futures contract or a specified mortgage-backed security,
respectively, for a specified price within a specified period of time or on a
specified date from or to the writer of the option.

Mandatory cash forward contracts on mortgage-backed securities are the
predominant derivative financial instruments used to minimize the market risk
during the period from when the Company extends an interest rate lock to a
loan applicant until the time the loan is sold to an investor. Options on
cash forward contracts on mortgage-backed securities are used in the same
manner as mandatory cash forward contracts, but provide protection from
interest rates rising, while still allowing an opportunity for profit if
interest rates fall. Options on the treasury futures contracts are used as
cross hedges on various loan product types and to protect the Company in a
volatile interest rate environment from unexpected increases, cancellations
or modifications in lending commitments.

Since PMC can terminate a loan commitment if the borrower does not
comply with the terms of the contract, and some loan commitments may expire
without being drawn upon, these commitments do not necessarily represent
future cash requirements of PMC. PMC evaluates the creditworthiness of these
transactions through its normal credit policies.

PMC has credit risk to the extent that the counterparties to the
derivative financial instruments do not perform their obligation under the
agreements. If one of the counterparties does not perform, PMC would not
receive the cash to which it is entitled under the conditions of the
agreement. PMC manages credit risk by entering into agreements with large
national investment bankers or financial institutions, all of whom meet PMC’s
established credit underwriting standards. Options on futures are traded on
organized exchanges with the exchange clearinghouse serving as the
counterparty in the trade, reducing the risk of non-performance. Management
does not anticipate any material losses as a result of its agreements and
does not consider them to represent an undue level of credit, interest or
liquidity risk for PMC.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Pulte Homes, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pulte Homes,
Inc. as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2001. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Pulte
Homes, Inc. at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
has not amortized goodwill acquired in a business combination consummated
subsequent to June 30, 2001, in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142.
