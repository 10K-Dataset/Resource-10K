PULTE HOMES, INC.




PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Pulte Homes, Inc.

Pulte Homes, Inc. is a publicly held holding company whose subsidiaries engage in the
homebuilding and financial services businesses. Our assets consist principally of the capital
stock of our subsidiaries and our income primarily consists of dividends from our subsidiaries.
Our direct subsidiaries include Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc., Del Webb Corporation (“Del
Webb”) and other subsidiaries engaged in the homebuilding business. Pulte Diversified Companies,
Inc.’s operating subsidiaries include Pulte Home Corporation, Pulte International Corporation
(“International”) and other subsidiaries engaged in the homebuilding business. Pulte Diversified
Companies, Inc.’s non-operating thrift subsidiary, First Heights Bank, fsb (“First Heights”), is
classified as a discontinued operation (see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
We also have a mortgage banking company, Pulte Mortgage LLC (“Pulte Mortgage”), which is a
subsidiary of Pulte Home Corporation.

In January 2005, we sold all of our Argentina operations. At December 31, 2004, the Argentina
operations have been classified as held for sale and presented as discontinued operations. (See
Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

We have two reportable business segments, Homebuilding and Financial Services, and one
non-operating segment, Corporate.

The Homebuilding segment consists of the following two business units:

•

Domestic Homebuilding, our core business, is engaged in the acquisition and development
of land principally for residential purposes within the continental United States and the
construction of housing on such land targeted for the first-time, first and second move-up,
and active adult home buyers.

•

International Homebuilding is primarily engaged in the acquisition and development of
land principally for residential purposes, and the construction of housing on such land in
Mexico and Puerto Rico.

The Financial Services segment consists principally of mortgage banking and title operations
conducted through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries.

Corporate is a non-operating segment that supports the operations of our subsidiaries by
acting as the internal source of financing, developing and implementing strategic initiatives
centered on new business development and operating efficiencies, and providing the administrative
support associated with being a publicly traded entity listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

Financial information, including revenue, pre-tax income and total assets of each of our
business segments is included in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Domestic Homebuilding

Consistent
with our strategy of serving all major customer segments: first-time, first and
second move-up and active adult, our communities offer a wide variety of home designs including
single family detached, townhouses, condominiums and duplexes at different prices and with varying
levels of options and amenities. Expanding the number of customer segments served within each of
our markets has enabled us to approximately double our annual closings over the past five years to
a record 38,612 homes closed in 2004. Over our 54-year history, we have delivered more than
408,000 homes throughout the United States.

On July 31, 2001, we merged with Del Webb in a tax-free stock-for-stock transaction. Del Webb
was primarily a homebuilder with operations in seven states. For the fiscal year ended June 30,
2001, Del Webb reported net income of $91.2 million on revenues of $1.9 billion and 7,038 unit
settlements. Backlog reported at June 30, 2001, was 3,682 units valued at approximately $994
million. This merger expanded and supported our leadership position. In particular, we believe
the merger strengthened our position among active adult (age 55 and older) homebuyers, added
important strategic land positions, provided operational savings from economies of scale, bolstered
our purchasing leverage, and enhanced our overall competitive position. In accordance with our
operational strategy, we will continue to evaluate available strategic acquisition opportunities
that are consistent with our long-range goals.

As of December 31, 2004, our Domestic Homebuilding operations offered homes for sale in 626
communities at sales prices ranging from $62,000 to $3.2 million. Sales prices of homes currently
offered for sale in 70% of our communities fall within the range of $100,000 to $350,000 with a
2004 average unit selling price of $287,000, compared with $259,000 in 2003, $242,000 in 2002,
$225,000 in 2001 and $206,000 in 2000. Sales of single-family detached homes, as a percentage of
total unit sales, were 80% in 2004, compared with 83% in 2003, 86% in 2002, and 82% in 2001 and
2000. Our Domestic Homebuilding operations are geographically diverse and, as a result, better
insulate us from demand changes in individual markets. As of December 31, 2004, our Domestic
Homebuilding business operated in 45 markets spanning 27 states.

As of December 31, 2004, our Domestic Homebuilding operations had 15,916 units in backlog
valued at approximately $5.2 billion.

International Homebuilding

Our International Homebuilding operations are principally conducted through subsidiaries of
International in Mexico and Puerto Rico. International Homebuilding product offerings focus on the
demand of first-time buyers and middle-to-upper income consumer groups. Effective January 1, 2002,
International reorganized its structure within Mexico to create a single company, Pulte Mexico S.
de R.L. de C.V., which ranks as one of the largest builders in the country. Prior to the
reorganization, these operations were conducted primarily through five joint ventures throughout
Mexico. Under the new ownership structure, which combines the largest of these entities, we own
63.8% of Pulte Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V. and have consolidated Pulte Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V. into
our financial statements. In accordance with the terms of a reorganization agreement dated as of
December 31, 2001, the minority shareholders notified us in January 2005 of their intent to
exercise a put option to sell their shares back to us, the consummation of which would result in
the our owning 100% of Pulte Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V. We believe that this transaction will not
have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

We are currently in the process of evaluating various long-term strategic alternatives with
regard to our International operations.



Homebuilding Operations (continued)

Land acquisition and development

We select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing extensive
market research, enabling us to match the location and product offering with our targeted consumer
group. We consider factors such as proximity to developed areas, population and job growth
patterns and, if applicable, estimated development costs. We historically have managed the risk of
controlling our land positions through use of option contracts and outright acquisition. We
typically control land with the intent to complete sales of housing units within 24 to 36 months
from the date of opening a community, except in the case of certain Del Webb active adult
developments and other selected large projects for which the completion of community build out
requires a longer time period due to typically larger project sizes. As a result, land is
generally purchased after it is properly zoned and developed or is ready for development. In
addition, we dispose of owned land not required in the business through sales to appropriate end
users. Where we develop land, we engage directly in many phases of the development process,
including land and site planning, obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals, as well
as constructing roads, sewers, water and drainage facilities and other amenities. We use our staff
and the services of independent engineers and consultants for land development activities. Land
development work is performed primarily by independent contractors and local government authorities
who construct sewer and water systems in some areas. At December 31, 2004, we controlled
approximately 343,000 lots, of which 158,000 were owned and 185,000 were under option agreements.

Sales and marketing

We are dedicated to improving the quality and value of our domestic homes through innovative
proprietary architectural and community designs and state-of-the-art customer marketing techniques.
Analyzing various qualitative and quantitative data obtained through extensive market research, we
segment our potential customers into well-defined buyer profiles. Segmentation analysis provides a
method for understanding the business opportunities and risks across the full spectrum of consumer
groups in each market. Once the demands of potential buyers are understood, we link our home
design and community development efforts to the specific lifestyle of each targeted consumer group.

To meet the demands of our various domestic customers, we have established a solid design
expertise for a wide array of product lines. We believe that we are an innovator in the design of
our homes and we view design capacity as an integral aspect of our marketing strategy. Our
in-house architectural services teams and management, supplemented by outside consultants, are
successful in creating distinctive design features, both in exterior facades and interior options
and features. In certain markets our strategy is to offer “the complete house” in which all
features shown in the home are included in the sales price. Standard features typically offered
include vaulted ceilings, appliances, and a variety of available flooring and carpet.

Typically, our domestic sales teams, together with outside sales brokers, are responsible for
guiding the customer through the sales process. We are committed to industry-leading customer
service through a variety of quality initiatives, including the customer care program, which
ensures that homeowners are comfortable at every stage of the building process. Using a
seven-step, interactive process, homeowners are kept informed during their homebuilding and home
owning experience. The steps include (1) a pre-construction meeting with the superintendent; (2)
pre-dry wall frame walk; (3) quality assurance inspection; (4) first homeowner orientation; (5)
30-day follow-up after the close of the home; (6) three-month follow-up; and (7) an 11-month
quality list after the close of the home. Fully furnished and landscaped model homes are used to
showcase our homes and their distinctive design features. We have great success with the
first-time buyer in the low to moderate price range; in such cases, financing under United States
Government-insured and guaranteed programs is often used and is facilitated through our mortgage
company. We also enjoy strong sales to the move-up buyer and, in certain markets, offer
semi-custom homes in higher price ranges.

As a result of the Del Webb merger, we are better able to address the needs of active adults,
among the fastest growing homebuying segments. We offer both destination communities and “in
place” communities, for those buyers who prefer to remain in their current geographic area. These
communities, with highly amenitized products such as golf courses, recreational centers and
educational classes, offer the active adult buyer many options to maintain an active lifestyle.



Homebuilding Operations (continued)

Sales and marketing (continued)

We have received recognition and awards as a result of our achievements as a homebuilder. In
2004, the Environmental Protection Agency named Pulte as an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year. Pulte
was also named as a Top-Ranked Homebuilder in BusinessWeek’s List of 50 Best Performers among the
S&P 500, coming in at number 11. We were number 78 on the Fortune 100 Fastest-Growing Companies
list. Pulte was the recipient of the inauguaral J.D. Power and Associates Platinum Award for
customer satisfaction, and was the winner of the first National Housing Quality “Gold Award”.

In addition, our Charlotte, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Detroit, Ft. Myers/Naples, Houston,
Jacksonville, Las Vegas, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Orlando, Palm Beach, Philadelphia, Tampa, Tucson,
and Washington, D.C. markets were recognized for ranking the highest in their markets in a national
customer satisfaction study. Nine of our markets came in second place, while six obtained third
place positions. The survey of twenty-five U. S. markets (with Pulte presence in twenty-four of
those markets) noted customer service, home readiness at the time of closing, and the company’s
sales staff as the three factors that most heavily influenced the customer’s overall level of
satisfaction. Developing the Pulte Homes brand and leveraging the strength of the “DiVosta,” “Del
Webb” and “Sun City” tradenames helps to distinguish our communities from the competition, and can
often be rewarded with the advantages of additional sales pace, choice community locations, and
reduced overall customer acquisition costs.

Our Homeowner for Life

TM

philosophy has increased our business from those who have
previously owned a Pulte home or have been referred by a Pulte homeowner by ensuring a positive
home buying and home owning experience. We introduce our homes to prospective buyers through a
variety of media advertising, illustrated brochures, Internet listings and link placements, and
other advertising displays. In addition, our websites,

www.pulte.com, www.delwebb.com,
www.divosta.com,

and

www.espanol.pulte.com

provide tools to help users find a home that meets their
needs, investigate financing alternatives, communicate moving plans, maintain a home, learn more
about us and communicate directly with us. Approximately 3.5 million potential customers visited
our websites during 2004.

Our international sales and marketing efforts focus on the identification of underserved
market demand, with strong emphasis on quality initiatives and customer service. In Mexico, where
our product is focused largely on social interest housing, sales and marketing efforts target areas
experiencing population and employment growth.

Construction

The construction process for our domestic homes begins with the in-house design of the homes
we sell. The building phase is conducted under the supervision of our on-site construction
superintendents. The construction work is usually performed by independent contractors under
contracts that, in many instances, cover both labor and materials on a fixed-price basis. We
believe that Pulte Preferred Partnerships (P


), an extension of our quality assurance
program, continues to establish new standards for contractor relations. Using a selective process,
we have teamed up with what we believe are premier contractors and suppliers to improve all aspects
of the land development and house construction processes.

We maintain efficient construction operations by using standard materials and components from
a variety of sources and, when possible, by building on contiguous lots. To minimize the effects
of changes in construction costs, the contracting and purchasing of building supplies and materials
generally is negotiated at or near the time when related sales contracts are signed. In addition,
we leverage our size by actively negotiating our materials needs on a national or regional basis to
minimize production component cost. We are also working to establish a more integrated system that
can effectively link suppliers, contractors and the production schedule through various strategic
business partnerships and e-business initiatives.

Housing in Mexico and Puerto Rico consists primarily of reinforced poured concrete, concrete
block and/or brick construction with flat roofs and public water, electric and sanitary system
connections. Building materials, supplies and components are sourced locally and the construction
work is performed by general contractors and/or independent contractors, which in many cases
include both labor and materials.

We cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials will be available at
reasonable prices in the future and have, on occasion, experienced shortages of skilled labor in
certain trades and of building materials in some markets.



Homebuilding Operations (continued)

Competition and other factors

Our dedication to customer satisfaction is evidenced by our consumer and value-based brand
approach to product development, and is something that we believe distinguishes us in the
homebuilding industry and contributes to our long-term competitive advantage. The housing industry
in the United States, however, is highly competitive. In each of our market areas, there are
numerous homebuilders with which we compete. We also compete with the resales of existing house
inventory. Any provider of housing units, for-sale or to rent, including apartment builders, may
be considered a competitor. Conversion of apartments to condominiums further provides certain
segments of the population an alternative to traditional housing, as does manufactured housing. We
compete primarily on the basis of price, reputation, design, location and quality of our homes.
The housing industry is affected by a number of economic and other factors including: (1)
significant national and world events, which impact consumer confidence; (2) changes in the costs
of building materials and labor; (3) changes in interest rates; (4) changes in other costs
associated with home ownership, such as property taxes and energy costs; (5) various demographic
factors; (6) changes in federal income tax laws; (7) changes in government mortgage financing
programs, and (8) availability of sufficient mortgage capacity. In addition to these factors, our
business and operations could be affected by shifts in demand for new homes.

Our operations are subject to building, environmental and other regulations of various
federal, state, local and foreign governing authorities. For our homes to qualify for Federal
Housing Administration (“FHA”) or Veterans Administration (“VA”) mortgages, we must satisfy
valuation standards and site, material and construction requirements of those agencies. Our
compliance with federal, state, local and foreign laws relating to protection of the environment
has had, to date, no material effect upon capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
More stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers, thereby
increasing the cost of compliance.

Financial Services Operations

We conduct our financial services business, which includes mortgage and title operations,
through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries.

Mortgage banking

Our mortgage bank arranges financing through the origination of mortgage loans primarily for
the benefit of our domestic homebuyers, but also services the general public. We also engage in
the sale of such loans and the related servicing rights. We are a lender approved by the FHA and
VA and are a seller/servicer approved by Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”), Federal
National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”) and other
investors. In our conventional mortgage lending activities we follow underwriting guidelines
established by FNMA and FHLMC.

Our mortgage underwriting, processing and closing functions are centralized in Denver,
Colorado using a mortgage operations center (“MOC”) concept. We also use a centralized telephone
loan officer concept where loan officers are centrally located at a mortgage application center
(“MAC”) in Denver. Our sales representatives, who are the mortgage customers’ main contact,
forward the loan applications to a MAC loan counselor who calls the customer to complete the loan
application and then forwards it to the MOC for processing. We believe both the MOC and the MAC
improve the speed and efficiency of our mortgage operations, thereby improving our profitability
and allowing us to focus on creating attractive mortgage financing opportunities for our customers.

In originating mortgage loans, we initially use our own funds and borrowings made available to
us through various credit arrangements. Subsequently, we sell such mortgage loans and
mortgage-backed securities to outside investors.

Our capture rate for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 was approximately 88%,
83% and 78%, respectively. Our capture rate represents loan originations from our homebuilding
business as a percent of total loan opportunities, excluding cash settlements, from our
homebuilding business. During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, we originated
mortgage loans for approximately 84%, 73% and 68%, respectively, of the homes we sold domestically.
Such originations represented 92%, 83% and 85%, respectively, of our originations.

We sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts to
reduce the risks inherent in servicing loans. This strategy results in owning the servicing rights
for only a short period of time, generally less than four months after the loan is originated,
which substantially reduces the risk of impairment with respect to the fair value of these reported
assets. The servicing sales contracts provide for the reimbursement of payments made when loans
prepay within specified periods of time, usually 90 days after sale or securitization.



Financial Services Operations (continued)

Mortgage banking (continued)

The mortgage industry in the United States is highly competitive. We compete with other
mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide attractive mortgage financing to both our
homebuyers and to the general public. The Internet is also an important resource for homebuyers in
obtaining financing as a number of companies provide online approval for their customers. These
Internet-based mortgage companies may also be considered competitors.

In originating and servicing mortgage loans, we are subject to rules and regulations of the
FHA, VA, GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC. In addition to being affected by changes in these programs, our
mortgage banking business is also affected by several of the same factors that impact our
homebuilding business.

Discontinued operations

First Heights

During the first quarter of 1994, we adopted a plan of disposal for First Heights and
announced our strategy to exit the thrift industry and increase our focus on housing and related
mortgage banking. First Heights sold all but one of its 32 bank branches and related deposits to
two unrelated purchasers. The sale was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 1994.
Although we expected to complete the plan of disposal within a reasonable period of time,
contractual disputes precluded us from completing the disposal in accordance with our original
plan.

First Heights’ day-to-day activities are principally devoted to supporting residual regulatory
compliance matters and the litigation with the United States government, discussed in Item 3, and
are not reflective of the active operations of the former thrift, such as maintaining traditional
transaction accounts (e.g., checking and savings accounts) or making loans. Accordingly, such
operations are presented as discontinued.

Argentina

In January 2005, we sold all of our Argentina operations to an Argentine company involved in
residential and commercial real estate development. The disposition of these operations was the
chosen action to improve our overall returns. At December 31, 2004, the Argentina operations have
been classified as held for sale and presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated
financial statements. Previously, the Argentina operations were included in the Homebuilding
segment. Total assets to be disposed of at December 31, 2004 were $15.4 million, consisting
primarily of cash and inventories. Total liabilities to be disposed of at December 31, 2004 were
$13.7 million and consisted primarily of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities.

Corporate

Corporate is a non-operating segment that is comprised primarily of Pulte Homes, Inc. and
Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc., both of which are holding companies. The primary purpose of
Corporate is to support the operations of our subsidiaries by acting as the internal source of
financing, developing and implementing strategic initiatives centered around new business
development and operating efficiencies. Business development activities include the pursuit of
additional domestic and international opportunities as well as the development of innovative
building components and processes. Corporate also includes the activities associated with
supporting a publicly traded entity listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

Corporate assets include equity investments in its subsidiaries, short-term financial
instruments and affiliate advances. Liabilities include senior and subordinated debt and income
taxes. Corporate revenues consist primarily of investment earnings of excess funds, while its
expenses include costs associated with supporting a publicly traded company and its subsidiaries’
operations, and investigating strategic initiatives.

Organization/Employees

All subsidiaries and operating units operate independently with respect to daily operations.
Homebuilding real estate purchases and other significant homebuilding, mortgage banking, financing
activities and similar operating decisions must be approved by the business unit and/or corporate
senior management.

At December 31, 2004, we employed approximately 13,000 people. Our employees are not
represented by any union. Contracted work, however, may be performed by union contractors.
Homebuilding and mortgage banking management personnel are paid performance bonuses and incentive
compensation. Performance bonuses are based on individual performance while incentive compensation
is based on the performance of the applicable business unit or subsidiary. Our corporate
management personnel are paid incentive compensation based on our overall performance. Each
subsidiary is given autonomy regarding employment of personnel, although our senior corporate
management acts in an advisory capacity in the employment of subsidiary officers. We consider our
employee and contractor relations to be satisfactory.



ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Our homebuilding and corporate headquarters are located at 100 Bloomfield Hills Parkway,
Bloomfield Hills, Michigan 48304, where we lease 81,740 square feet of office space. We lease
54,380 square feet of office space at 1230 West Washington Street, Tempe, Arizona 85281 for certain
corporate and business services. Pulte Mortgage’s offices are located at 7475 South Joliet Street,
Englewood, Colorado 80112, 99 Inverness Drive East, Englewood, Colorado 80112, and 12300 East
Arapahoe Road, Centennial, Colorado 80112. We lease approximately 61,436 square feet, 24,400
square feet and 43,050 square feet, respectively, of office space at these locations. Our
homebuilding markets and mortgage branch operations generally lease office space for their
day-to-day operations. First Heights’ administrative office is located in 550 square feet of
leased space at 2010 North Loop West, Suite 105, Houston, Texas 77018.

Because of the nature of our homebuilding operations, significant amounts of property are held
as inventory in the ordinary course of our homebuilding business. Such properties are not included
in response to this Item.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are involved in various litigation incidental to our continuing business operations. We
believe that none of this litigation will have a material adverse impact on our results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.

Storm Water Discharge Practices

In April 2004, we received a request for information from the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (“EPA”) pursuant to Section 308 of the Clean Water Act. The request seeks
information about storm water discharge practices in connection with homebuilding projects
completed or underway by us. We have provided the EPA with this information. Although the matter
has since been referred to the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) for enforcement, the EPA
has asked that we engage in “pre-filing” negotiations to resolve the matter short of litigation.
We are actively engaged in these negotiations. If the negotiations fail and the DOJ alleges that
we have violated regulatory requirements applicable to storm water discharges, the government may
seek injunctive relief and penalties. We believe that we have defenses to any such allegations.
At this time, however, we can neither predict the outcome of this inquiry, nor can we currently
estimate the costs that may be associated with its eventual resolution.

First Heights-related litigation

We are a party to a lawsuit relating to First Heights’ 1988 acquisition from the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (“FSLIC”) and First Heights’ ownership of five failed Texas
thrifts. The lawsuit (the Court of Federal Claims Case) was filed on December 26, 1996, in the
United States Court of Federal Claims (Washington, D.C.) by Pulte Homes, Inc., Pulte Diversified
Companies, Inc. and First Heights (collectively, the Pulte Parties) against the United States.

In the Court of Federal Claims Case, the Pulte Parties assert breaches of contract on the part
of the United States in connection with the enactment of Section 13224 of the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993 (“OBRA”). That provision repealed portions of the tax benefits that the
Pulte Parties claim they were entitled to under the contract to acquire the failed Texas thrifts.
The Pulte Parties also assert other claims concerning the contract, including that the United
States (through the FDIC as receiver) improperly attempted to amend the failed thrifts’
pre-acquisition tax returns and that this attempt was made in an effort to deprive the Pulte
Parties of tax benefits for which they had contracted.

On August 17, 2001, the United States Court of Federal Claims ruled that the United States
government is liable to the Pulte Parties for breach of contract by enacting Section 13224 of OBRA.
In September 2003, the United States Court of Federal Claims issued final judgment that the Pulte
Parties had been damaged by approximately $48.7 million as a result of the United States
government’s breach of contract with them. The United States government and the Pulte Parties
appealed the final judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
October 2003. Accordingly, any gain related to this litigation will be recognized only upon final
resolution.

as follows:

Homebuilding Operations



Overview (continued)

Financial Services Operations

•

Mortgage origination units, origination principal and our capture rate increased during
2004 compared with 2003, and during 2003 compared with 2002. Pre-tax income for the year
ended December 31, 2004 decreased 31% compared with 2003 due to a shift in our product
mix, starting in the second half of 2003, toward adjustable rate mortgages (“ARMs”) versus
fixed rate mortgages due to changes in customer mortgage product preference. Pre-tax
income of our financial services business segment increased 3% from 2002 in 2003, driven
by an increase in loan originations and a higher capture rate tempered by product mix
changes and a less favorable interest rate environment during the last half of the year.

Corporate

•

Pre-tax loss of our non-operating Corporate segment increased 20% in 2004 to $90.7 million and
in 2003, pre-tax loss increased 22% from 2002. During 2004, net interest expense
increased due to higher debt levels as a result of our growth. Other corporate expenses,
net in 2004 were impacted by increased charitable contributions expense. In addition,
income recognized during 2003 and 2002 from the sale and adjustment to fair value of
various non-operating parcels of commercial land held for sale did not recur in 2004,
resulting in higher net expense. During 2003, other corporate expenses, net increased due
principally to higher compensation-related costs.

Homebuilding Operations

Our Homebuilding segment consists of the following operations:

•

Domestic Homebuilding - We conduct our Domestic Homebuilding operations in 45 markets
located throughout 27 states. Domestic Homebuilding offers a broad product line to meet
the needs of the first-time, first and second move-up, and active adult homebuyers.

•

International Homebuilding - We conduct our International Homebuilding operations
through subsidiaries of International Corporation (International) in Mexico and Puerto
Rico. International focuses on the demand of first-time buyers and middle-to-upper income
consumer groups. We are currently in the process of evaluating various long-term
strategic alternatives with regard to our International operations.

(a)

Net new orders for the year ended December 31, 2003 do not include 1,051
units of acquired backlog and the related dollars.

Continued strong demand for new homes, supported by a favorable interest rate
environment, an increase in the number of active communities and market share expansion, drove
increases in net new orders, unit settlements and unit backlog. Net new orders increased 16% to a
record 40,576 units, for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net new orders for the year ended
December 31, 2003 increased 13% to 34,989 units compared with 30,830 units for the year ended
December 31, 2002

Home settlements set a record for the year ended December 31, 2004 at 38,612 units, an
increase of 18% over the same period in 2003. In 2003, home settlements also reached a record
high, increasing 13% to 32,693 units. Active communities increased from 460 in 2002 to 535 in 2003
to 626 in 2004.



Homebuilding Operations (continued)

Changes in average selling price reflect a number of factors, including price increases, the
mix of product closed during a period and the number of options purchased by customers. The
average selling price for our homes increased 11% for the year ended December 31, 2004, to $287,000
compared with 2003 and increased to $259,000 in 2003 from $242,000 in 2002. The most significant
price increases for both 2004 and 2003 were in the West, Northeast and Florida in the Southeast
geographic areas.

Ending backlog, which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed, grew to a record
15,916 units at December 31, 2004 compared with 13,952 units at December 31, 2003 and 10,605 units
at December 31, 2002. The dollar value of our backlog was up 24% to $5.2 billion at December 31,
2004, compared with $4.1 billion at December 31, 2003 and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2002. Our
most significant increases at December 31, 2004, occurred in the Southeast and West, which had unit
increases of 42% and 10% respectively. At December 31, 2003, compared with December 31, 2002,
strong demand resulted in significant increases in backlog for all geographic areas of the country
except the Midwest.

As announced on October 4, 2004, we lowered pricing in Las Vegas to better align pricing in
our communities with pricing in the market. This action was in response to a period of slow
sign-ups and increased cancellation rates, which we attributed to our then above-market pricing.
However, since the price reductions took effect in October of 2004, our communities in Las Vegas
have experienced improved traffic and new order activity. Las Vegas backlog totaled 883 units,
with a value of $379 million at December 31, 2004, which represented 6% and 7% of total domestic
homebuilding units and dollars, respectively. At December 31, 2003, Las Vegas backlog totaled
1,770 units, with a value of $627.6 million, which represented 13% and 15% of total domestic
homebuilding units and dollars, respectively.

During August and September of 2004 four hurricanes occurred throughout Florida and the
southeastern areas of the United States. We sustained minimal property damage, but did experience
delayed home settlements and incurred additional overhead expenses related to lost workdays and
cleanup efforts undertaken as a result of the hurricanes. Further, the impact of the storms
delayed the opening of several new communities and resulted in shortages of building materials in
some Florida markets.

The West contributed the largest portion of our operating activities, compared with the other
geographic areas in the domestic homebuilding operations, representing 37% of unit net new orders
and unit settlements for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared with 35% of settlements and 37%
of net new orders during 2003, and 32% of settlements and 33% of net new orders during 2002. The
West contributed the largest portion of our backlog, compared with other geographic areas in the
domestic homebuilding operations, representing 43%, 44% and 38% of the total domestic homebuilding
backlog units at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The following table presents markets that represent 10% or more of unit new orders, unit

Homebuilding Operations (continued)

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, our Domestic Homebuilding operations controlled approximately
343,400 and 256,900 lots, respectively. Approximately 158,000 and 120,400 lots were owned, and
approximately 125,800 and 66,000 lots were under option agreements approved for purchase at

2003.

The total purchase price applicable to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding
operations at future dates approximated $4.1 billion at December 31, 2004. In addition, total
purchase price applicable to land under option pending approval was valued at $2.4 billion at

Domestic homebuilding interest expense, which represents the
amortization of capitalized interest, is included as part of homebuilding cost of
sales.

Homebuilding gross profit margins from home sales in 2004 increased 200 basis points over
2003 to 22.6%, and in 2003 increased 120 basis points to 20.6% compared with 2002. The increases
are due to strong consumer demand, positive home pricing, favorable shifts in product and
geographic mix, the benefits of leverage-buy purchasing activities and effective production and
inventory management.

We consider land acquisition one of our core competencies. We acquire land primarily for the
construction of our homes for sale to homebuyers. We will often sell select parcels of land within
or adjacent to our communities to retail and commercial establishments. We also will, on occasion,
sell lots within our communities to other homebuilders. Gross profits from land sales were $99.8
million and $65.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively,
representing increases of $33.9 million and $12.9 million, respectively, from the previous years
totals. Revenues and their related gains/losses may vary significantly between periods, depending
on the timing of land sales. We continue to evaluate our existing land positions to ensure the
most effective use of capital. Included in other assets is approximately $230.1 million in land
held for disposition as of December 31, 2004, as compared to $251.2 million and $218.8 million at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a
percentage of home settlement revenues, decreased 90 basis points to 8.8% compared with 2003 after
increasing 20 basis points to 9.7% in 2003 compared with 2002. The improvement in 2004 can be
attributed to greater leverage as a result of volume increases and the favorable pricing
environment for our homes. The increase in 2003 is principally attributable to costs associated
with the realignment of our field operations and organizations to meet the challenge and
opportunity for future growth.

Equity income for 2004 includes earnings from our 50% investment in a joint venture that
supplies and installs basic building components and operating systems, acquired in January 2004,
and two Nevada-based joint ventures, related to the sale of commercial and residential properties.
Equity income for 2003 primarily includes earnings from the two Nevada-based joint ventures.

Other income (expense), net includes the write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs
resulting from decisions not to pursue certain land acquisitions and options, insurance-related
expenses and settlements and other non-operating expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2004,
the increase in expense is due to larger write-offs of deposit and pre-acquisition costs, as we
continue to evaluate potential land acquitions for the most effective use of capital.



Homebuilding Operations (continued)

International Homebuilding

Our International Homebuilding operations are primarily conducted through subsidiaries of
International in Mexico and Puerto Rico.

In January 2005, the Company sold all of its Argentina operations. At
December 31, 2004, the Argentina operations have been classified as held for sale and
presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements (see
Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

International unit settlements for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, increased
12% and 9%, respectively. International revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003
increased 3% and 12%, respectively, over the prior year periods. Revenues increased for both years
primarily due to increased unit closings in Mexico. Our operations in Puerto Rico have experienced
decreased unit closings and revenue as more of our business there has shifted to joint venture
affiliates.

The higher proportion of unit settlements derived from Mexico, coupled with a higher
percentage of those closings coming from economic housing, which is the lowest price point served
in Mexico, had a negative impact on gross margins in 2004 compared with 2003. Gross margins
decreased approximately 100 basis points to 19.2% for the year ended December 31, 2004. For the
year ended December 31, 2003, gross margins were 20.2%, an increase of 50 basis points compared
with 2002, due to favorable product and geographic mix shifts in Mexico.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue decreased by 340 basis
points to 14.5% in 2004 from 17.9% in 2003 and 17.3% in 2002. The increase from 2002 to 2003 was
driven primarily by reorganization costs incurred during the restructuring of our operations in
Mexico in an effort to enhance future profitability while the improvement in 2004 reflects the
benefits of the restructuring actions.

Our operations in Mexico are affected by fluctuations in currency rates for that country.
Transaction gains and losses for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, classified as
other income (expense), net, were not significant. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003,
we recorded a foreign currency translation gain of $781 thousand and a loss of $5.9 million,
respectively, for Mexico, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance
sheet. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded a foreign currency translation gain of
$8.6 million for Mexico. At December 31, 2004, our investment in Puerto Rico and Mexico, net of
accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments, approximated $28.8 million, and $72.2
million, respectively.



Financial Services Operations

We conduct our financial services business, which includes mortgage and title operations,
through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries.

We sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts.
Due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held, generally less than four months, we
do not amortize the servicing asset. Since the servicing rights are recorded based on the value in
the servicing sales contracts, there are no impairment issues related to these assets. We also
originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit
arrangements, and then sell such mortgage loans to outside investors.

The following table presents mortgage origination data for our Financial Services operations:

Pre-tax income of our financial services operations was $47.4 million, $68.8 million and $66.7
million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Mortgage origination unit and principal volume for the year ended December 31, 2004, increased
23% and 35%, respectively, over 2003. Mortgage origination unit and principal volume for the year
ended December 31, 2003, increased 24% and 32%, respectively, over 2002. This growth can be
attributed to increases in the capture rate of 510 basis points to 87.8% in 2004 and 510 basis
points to 82.7% in 2003, combined with the volume increases experienced in our homebuilding
business and an increase in average loan size. Our capture rate represents loan originations from
our homebuilding business as a percent of total loan opportunities, excluding cash settlements,
from our homebuilding business. Our domestic homebuilding customers continue to account for the
majority of total loan production, representing 92% of Pulte Mortgage unit production for 2004,
compared with 83% in 2003 and 85% in 2002.

Adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) represented 43% of total funded origination dollars and 42%
of total funded origination units for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared with 24% and 22%,
respectively, in 2003 and 16% and 13%, respectively, in 2002. Refinancings represented 3% of total
loan production in 2004, compared with 8% in both 2003 and 2002.

At December 31, 2004, loan application backlog was $3.5 billion, compared with $2.2 billion
and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Pre-tax income decreased 31% for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared with 2003, as
increased volume was offset by changes in product mix to ARMs, which generally have a lower profit
per loan than fixed rate products. The shift to ARMs is attributable to customer mortgage product
preference. In addition, in 2004, 36% of total originations were brokered loans, which are less
profitable to us, compared with 16% in 2003. Mortgage origination fees increased to $20.5 million
for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared with $7.5 million in 2003, due to the increase in
brokered loans. Gains from the sale of mortgages during 2004 decreased $14.1 million, or 22%, from
$64.4 million in 2003, and net interest income decreased $5.5 million, to $9.7 million during 2004
as compared with $15.1 million in 2003. These decreases were due to the product mix shifts and an
unfavorable interest rate environment in 2004 compared with 2003. Income from our title operations
was $17.6 million in 2004, an increase of 30% over 2003. Our minority interest in Su Casita, a
Mexican mortgage banking company, contributed income of $4 million for the year ended December 31,
2004, compared with $4.4 million in 2003. Selling, general and administrative expense for the year
ended December 31, 2004, increased 41% to $57.5 million compared with 2003 due to increased
origination volume.

Pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2003, increased 3% to $68.8 million, as a
result of increased volume, partially offset by a less favorable interest rate environment for
selling loans during the last six months of the year and an increase in training, systems, and
facilities costs incurred in anticipation of the projected growth of the business. Gains from the
sale of mortgages increased $2.0 million, or 3%, from the same period in 2002. As compared with
2002, net interest income increased $3.8 million to $15.1 million during 2003 due to increased
production. Title income grew 11% contributing $13.5 million to pre-tax income for the year.



Financial Services Operations (continued)

We hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with
derivative financial instruments. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we did not recognize any
material net gains or losses related to an ineffective portion of the hedging instrument. We also
did not recognize any material net gains or losses during 2004 for cash flow hedges that were
discontinued because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur. At
December 31, 2004, we expect to reclassify $138 thousand, net of taxes, of net gains on derivative
instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months
from sales of closed mortgage loans.

Corporate

Corporate is a non-operating segment that supports the operations of our subsidiaries by
acting as the internal source of financing, developing and implementing strategic initiatives
centered on new business development and operating efficiencies, and providing the necessary
administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity listed on the New York Stock
Exchange. As a result, the corporate segment’s operating results will vary from year to year as
these strategic initiatives evolve.

The following table presents this segment’s results of operations ($000’s omitted):

Interest expense, net of interest capitalized into inventory, increased 20% to $47.4 million
in 2004 and 3% to $39.4 million in 2003. This trend is a result of an increase in debt levels
necessary to support our growth. Interest incurred for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003,
and 2002, excluding interest incurred by our financial services operations, was approximately
$205.2 million, $179 million and $162.5 million, respectively.

The increase in other corporate expenses, net for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared
with the prior year was partially due to increased charitable contributions. Additionally, during
2003 and 2002, we recognized income from the sale and adjustment to fair value of various
non-operating parcels of commercial land held for sale. Other corporate expense, net in 2003
increased $12.2 million compared with 2002 principally as a result of higher compensation-related
costs.

Interest capitalized into inventory is charged to home cost of sales based on the cyclical
timing of our unit settlements, over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our
communities. Interest in inventory, has increased primarily as a result of higher levels of
indebtedness and the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle.

Discontinued Operations

First Heights

- During the third quarter of 2004, 2003 and 2002, we recorded
non-cash, after-tax gains of $10.8 million, $7.9 million and $10 million, respectively, related to
the favorable resolution of certain tax matters relating to our thrift operation, First Heights
Bank, fsb (First Heights), which we discontinued in 1994.

In September 2003, the United States Court of Federal Claims issued final judgment that Pulte
Homes, Inc., Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc. and First Heights (collectively, the Pulte Parties)
had been damaged by approximately $48.7 million as a result of the United States government’s
breach of contract with them. The final judgment follows the Court’s August 17, 2001 ruling that
the United States breached the contract related to the Pulte Parties’ 1988 acquisition of five
savings and loan associations by enacting Section 13224 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1993. The United States government and the Pulte Parties filed Notices of Appeal with the United
States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in October 2003. Accordingly, any gain related to
this litigation will be recognized only upon final resolution.

Argentina

— In January 2005, we sold all of our Argentina operations to an Argentine
company involved in residential and commercial real estate development. The disposition of these
operations was the chosen action to improve our overall returns. At December 31, 2004, the
Argentina operations have been classified as held for sale and presented as discontinued operations
in the consolidated financial statements. Previously, the Argentina operations were included in
the Homebuilding segment.

For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, discontinued Argentine operations
reported pre-tax losses of $1.4 million, $1.9 million, and $200 thousand, respectively. In
addition, we recognized a pre-tax loss of $33.2 million ($20.6 million after-tax) on the write-down
of the Argentina operations to fair value less costs to sell.

Our operations in Argentina are affected by fluctuations in currency rates. At December 31,
2004, foreign currency translation losses of $25.1 million, which were previously recorded as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet, were recognized in the
income statement in connection with the classification of these operations as held for sale. These
were included in the pre-tax loss of $33.2 million on the write-down to fair value. For the year
ended December 31, 2003, we recorded a foreign currency translation gain of $1.9 million for
Argentina, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet.

Total assets to be disposed of at December 31, 2004 were $15.4 million, consisting primarily
of cash and inventories. Total liabilities to be disposed of at December 31, 2004 were $13.7
million and consisted primarily of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

We finance our homebuilding land acquisitions, development and construction activities from
internally generated funds and existing credit agreements.

At December 31, 2004, we had cash and equivalents of $314.6 million and $2.9 billion of senior
notes outstanding. Other financing included limited recourse collateralized financing totaling
$81.9 million. Sources of our working capital include our cash and equivalents, our $1.31 billion
committed unsecured revolving credit facility and Pulte Mortgage’s $940 million committed credit
arrangements.

Our debt-to-total capitalization, excluding our collateralized debt, was approximately 38.8%
at December 31, 2004, and approximately 36% net of cash and equivalents. We routinely monitor
current operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate the use of available
financing sources, including securities offerings.

Pulte Mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds
and borrowings made available pursuant to various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements.
At December 31, 2004, Pulte Mortgage had committed credit arrangements of $940 million comprised of
a $390 million bank revolving credit facility and a $550 million annual asset-backed commercial
paper program.

Our income tax liability and related effective tax rate are affected by a number of factors.
In 2004, our effective tax rate was 37.65% compared to 38% in 2003 and 39% in 2002. The reduction
in the effective tax rate for 2004 was principally due to the favorable resolution of certain state
tax matters. The reduction in the effective tax rate during 2003 was principally due to a lower
than expected effective state income tax rate for 2003 and the shareholders’ approval of our new
Senior Management Annual Incentive Plan, which allows full tax deductibility of Plan payments under
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Service Code. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for
2005 will be approximately 38%.

Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2004, amounted to
$698.3 million, compared with $331.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increases
in net income for both years were offset primarily by significant investments in land necessary to
support the continued growth of the business. Our net cash provided by operating activities for the
year ended December 31, 2002, was $158.8 million. The increase in net income was aided by the
realization of certain tax benefits and an increase in accrued liabilities, while inventories
continued to build to support the growth of the business.

Cash used in investing activities was $198.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004,
compared with $4.3 million in the prior year. The change in net cash used in investing activities
primarily relates to our investments in unconsolidated entities. During January 2004, we invested
$35 million for a 50% ownership interest in an entity that supplies and installs basic building
components and operating systems. During 2004, we invested approximately $117.8 million in three
new joint ventures that develop and/or sell land within the United States. Also, we contributed
$44.2 million of additional capital contributions to and received $66.1 million in distributions
from our unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2004. Further, we incurred
approximately $75.2 million in capital expenditures to support the growth of our business. Net
cash provided by investing activities was $12.1 million in 2002.

Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $809.6 million for the year ended December
31, 2004. Cash inflows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 are primarily
attributed to proceeds received from our $500 million, 5.25% senior notes issued in January 2004
and our $400 million, 4.875% senior notes issued in July 2004, and $44 million of cash received
from the exercise of stock options. Cash outflows from financing activities for the year ended
December 31, 2004 primarily relate to the repayment of our $112 million, 8.375% senior notes in
August 2004, redemption of the remaining $77 million of Del Webb 10.25% senior subordinated notes
in February 2004, approximately $25.4 million of cash dividends paid to our shareholders, $44.9
million used to repay borrowings, and $14.7 million used to repurchase our common stock.

Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003, was $128.9
million, reflecting proceeds from the $300 million senior notes issued in February and the $400
million senior notes issued in May and proceeds from employee stock option exercises, offset by the
repayment of debt, dividends paid and stock repurchases.

Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, was $374
million, reflecting proceeds from the $300 million senior notes issued in June 2002, proceeds from
borrowings under our various credit facilities and proceeds from employee stock option exercises,
offset by the repayment of debt, dividends paid and stock repurchases.



Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)

Our $125 million, 7.3% unsecured senior notes are due in 2005. We anticipate repaying these
notes in 2005 by issuing new unsecured senior notes and/or using cash provided by operations.

In September 2004, we restructured and amended the 5-year unsecured revolving credit facility,
increasing the borrowing availability from $850 million to $1.31 billion, extending the maturity
date from September 30, 2008 to September 15, 2009, with pricing more favorable to the Company.
The credit facility includes an uncommitted accordion feature, under which the credit facility may
be increased to $1.5 billion. The Company has the capacity to issue letters of credit up to $750
million. Borrowing availability is reduced by the amount of letters of credit outstanding. The
credit facility contains restrictive covenants, the most restrictive of which requires the Company
not to exceed a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 50% as defined in the agreement. We had no
outstanding borrowings under this unsecured revolving credit facility at December 31, 2004.

In September 2004, Pulte Mortgage amended its commercial paper conduit, which increased a
sub-limit for eligible collateral, eliminated the $50 million quarterly accordion feature, and made
pricing more favorable to Pulte Mortgage. The commercial paper conduit is a $550 million committed
line of credit. We had outstanding borrowings of $525 million under the commercial paper conduit
at December 31, 2004.

In July 2004, we expanded the capacity on Pulte Mortgage’s revolving credit facility from $355
million to $390 million. The revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants, the most
restrictive of which requires Pulte Mortgage to maintain a minimum tangible net worth of $30
million and adjusted liabilities cannot exceed 12 times adjusted net worth. There were
approximately $91.2 million of borrowings outstanding under Pulte Mortgage’s revolving credit
facility at December 31, 2004. Mortgage loans originated by Pulte Mortgage are subsequently sold
to outside investors. We anticipate that there will be adequate mortgage financing available for
purchasers of our homes.

In July 2004, we sold $400 million of 4.875% senior notes, which mature on July 15, 2009 and
are guaranteed by Pulte Homes, Inc. and certain of its 100%-owned subsidiaries. These notes are
unsecured and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
Proceeds from this offering were used for the repayment of expiring notes due on August 15, 2004 of
approximately $112 million and for general corporate purposes, including continued investment in
our business.

In January 2004, we sold $500 million of 5.25% senior notes, which mature on January 15, 2014
and are guaranteed by Pulte Homes, Inc. and certain of its 100%-owned subsidiaries. These notes
are unsecured and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
Proceeds from the sale were used to retire the $77 million outstanding Del Webb 10.25% senior
subordinated notes and for general corporate purposes, including continued investment in our
business.

At December 31, 2004, we had $600 million remaining under our current mixed security shelf
registration. Subsequent to December 31, 2004, we sold $350 million of 5.2% senior notes, which
mature on February 15, 2015, and $300 million of 6% senior notes, which mature on February 15,
2035, which are guaranteed by Pulte Homes, Inc. and certain of its 100%-owned subsidiaries. These
notes are unsecured and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated
indebtedness. Proceeds from the sale were used to repay the indebtedness of our revolving credit
facility and for general corporate purposes, including continued investment in our business.

At December 31, 2004, we had remaining authorization to purchase common stock aggregating
$62.8 million, pursuant to our $100 million share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2004, we
have repurchased a total of 1,256,400 shares for a total of $37.2 million.

In December 2003, we increased our dividend 150% to $.05 per share from $.02 per share,
effective for the fourth quarter of 2003. There was no change to our dividend rate during 2004.

Inflation

We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high
inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation also increases our financing,
labor and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the
affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass to our
customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. To date, inflation has not
had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there is no assurance that
inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We use standby letters of credit and performance bonds to guarantee our performance under
various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our projects. The expiration
dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related
projects. If the obligations related to a project are ongoing, annual extensions of the letters of
credit are typically granted on a year-to-year basis. At December 31, 2004, we had outstanding
letters of credit of $356 million. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates; rather,
we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which
approximated $1.49 billion at December 31, 2004, are typically outstanding over a period that
approximates 3-5 years. We do not believe that we will be required to draw upon any such letters
of credit or performance bonds.

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land option or option type agreements in
order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future. At December 31, 2004, these
agreements totaled approximately $6.5 billion. Pursuant to these land option agreements, we
provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times
in the future, usually at predetermined prices. If the entity holding the land under option is a
variable interest entity, our deposit represents a variable interest in that entity. At December
31, 2004, we consolidated certain variable interest entities with assets totaling $106.4 million.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, our unconsolidated joint ventures had outstanding debt of $58.1
million and $72.6 million, respectively. We have not guaranteed any of this outstanding
indebtedness.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with United
States generally accepted accounting principles. When more than one accounting principle, or the
method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is
appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the
future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these
estimates. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, we have made our best estimates
and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements,
giving due regard to materiality. The development and selection of the following critical
accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors.

Revenue recognition

Homebuilding

– Homebuilding revenues are recorded when the sales of homes are
completed and ownership has transferred to the customer. Unfunded settlements are deposits in
transit on homes for which the sale was completed. We do not engage in arrangements whereby we
have ongoing relationships with our homebuyers that require us to repurchase our homes or provide
homebuyers with the right of return.

Financial
Services

– Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans
for various investors. Servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding
principal balance, or a contracted set fee in the case of certain sub-servicing, and are credited
to income when related mortgage payments are received. Loan origination fees, commitment fees and
certain direct loan origination costs are deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the related
mortgage loan until such loan is sold. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are
recognized when the loans are sold. Interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is
originated until the loan is sold.

Inventory valuation

Our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated costs or net realizable value.
Included in inventories are all direct development costs. Inventories under development or held
for development are stated at accumulated cost, unless they are determined to be impaired, in which
case these inventories are measured at fair value. If actual market conditions are less favorable
than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments may be required.

We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories. Interest capitalized each quarter
is identified as a separate layer in our capitalized interest balance sheet pool. Each layer of
capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities
under development. Interest expense is allocated to the quarters over the amortization period based
on the cyclical timing of unit settlements.

Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis. Under the specific identification
basis, cost of sales includes the construction cost of the home, an average lot cost by project
based on land acquisition and development costs, and closing costs and commissions. Construction
cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home, plus an accrual for
costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost. This accrual
is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared to the amount
accrued, and adjustments are made if needed. Total project land acquisition and development costs
are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared to actual costs incurred to date and estimates
to complete. Adjustments to estimated total project land acquisition and development costs for the
project affect the amount of future lots costed.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)

Residential mortgage loans available-for-sale

Residential mortgage loans available-for-sale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or
market value. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are
sold. We hedge our residential mortgage loans available-for-sale. Gains and losses from closed
commitments and futures contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on the sale of
mortgage loans.

Goodwill and intangible assets

We have recorded certain intangible assets and goodwill, most recently as a result of the Del
Webb merger in 2001. Intangible assets, primarily trademarks and tradenames, were valued using
proven valuation procedures and are amortized over their estimated useful life. Goodwill is
subject to annual impairment testing. The carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets
is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their
use. If our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly, intangible
assets and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material. If we
determine that the carrying value of intangible assets, long-lived assets and goodwill may not be
recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we measure impairment
based on one of three methods. For assets related to ongoing operations, we use a projected
undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists and then measure impairment using
discounted cash flows. For assets to be disposed of, we assess the fair value of the asset based
on current market conditions for similar assets. For goodwill, we assess fair value by measuring
discounted cash flows of our reporting units and measure impairment as the difference between the
resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value.

The estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments
regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control. Changes in these
estimates could result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and material
charges to the results of operations.

Allowance for warranties

Home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building defects. The specific
terms and conditions of those warranties vary geographically. Most warranties cover different
aspects of the home’s construction and operating systems for a period of up to ten years. We
estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of
such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability
include the number of homes sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per
claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts
as necessary. Although we have not made significant adjustments to the accrual in the past, actual
warranty cost in the future could differ from our current estimate.

Insurance

The Company has, and requires the majority of its subcontractors to have general liability and
workers compensation insurance. These insurance policies protect the Company against a portion of
its risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self-insured retentions, deductibles, and other
coverage limits. The Company reserves for costs to cover its self-insured and deductible amount
under those policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits in excess of its coverage limits or
not covered by such policies, based on an analysis of the Company’s historical claims, which
includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. The Company’s total reserves for
such items were $115.6 million and $81.1 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Expenses related to such claims were approximately $58.4 million, $40.9 million, and $25.8 million
for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

Stock-based compensation

We currently have several stock-based employee compensation plans. Effective January 1, 2003
we adopted the preferable fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” We selected the
prospective method of adoption as permitted by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation – Transition and Disclosure.” Under the prospective method, we recognize compensation
expense on an accelerated basis over the vesting period based on the fair value provisions of SFAS
No. 123. Grants made prior to January 1, 2003 continue to be accounted for under the recognition
and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and
related Interpretations. With the exception of certain variable stock option grants, no
stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income for grants made prior to January
1, 2003, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value
of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)

Stock-based compensation (continued)

We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of each option
grant. The Black-Scholes model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected
volatility, risk-free interest rates and expected lives. These assumptions reflect management’s
best estimates, but these items involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally
outside of our control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, stock-based compensation
expense could have been materially impacted. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions
in future periods, stock-based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future periods.

On December 15, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, which amends SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS No. 123(R) requires that all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, be accounted for at fair value. The pro
forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 no longer will be an alternative to
financial statement recognition. Under SFAS No. 123(R), we must determine the appropriate fair
value model to be used for valuing share-based payments, the amortization method for compensation
cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption. We previously adopted the
fair-value-based method of accounting for share-based payments under SFAS No. 123 effective January
1, 2003 using the prospective method described in SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation—Transition and Disclosure. Currently, we use the Black-Scholes model to estimate the
value of stock options granted to employees and we are considering the preferred lattice model.
Because SFAS No. 123(R) must be applied not only to new awards but to previously granted awards
that are not fully vested on the effective date, and because we adopted SFAS No. 123 using the
prospective transition method (which applied only to awards granted, modified or settled after the
adoption date), compensation cost for some previously granted awards that were not recognized under
SFAS No. 123 will be recognized under SFAS No. 123(R). SFAS No. 123(R) also amends SFAS No. 95,
Statement of Cash Flows, to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow
rather than as a reduction of taxes paid. As originally issued, SFAS No. 95 required all income
tax payments to be classified as operating cash outflows. This statement is effective for fiscal
periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We are still evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS No.
123(R).

Pulte Mortgage, operating as a mortgage banker, is also subject to interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed-upon terms (i.e.,
commit to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk
continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2004 and
2003, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In
periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers
locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float.

We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing
agreement tied to the Federal Funds rate and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and closed loans
through derivative financial instruments. These financial instruments include cash forward
placement contracts on mortgage-backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on
treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage-backed
securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate
parallel shifts in long-term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100 and 150 basis points would not be
material to our financial results.

At December 31, 2004, our aggregate net investments exposed to foreign currency exchange rate
risk include our operations in Mexico, which approximated $72.2 million, and our mortgage banking
joint venture investment in Mexico, which approximated $21.1 million.

Summary of significant accounting policies

Basis of presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pulte Homes, Inc., all of
its direct and indirect subsidiaries (the “Company”) and variable interest entities in which
the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The direct subsidiaries of Pulte Homes,
Inc. include Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc., Del Webb Corporation (“Del Webb”) and other
subsidiaries that are engaged in the homebuilding business. Pulte Diversified Companies,
Inc.’s operating subsidiaries include Pulte Home Corporation, Pulte International Corporation
(“International”) and other subsidiaries that are engaged in the homebuilding business. Pulte
Diversified Companies, Inc.’s non-operating thrift subsidiary, First Heights Bank, fsb (“First
Heights”), is classified as a discontinued operation (See Note 3). The Company also has a
mortgage banking company, Pulte Mortgage LLC (“Pulte Mortgage”), which is a subsidiary of Pulte
Home Corporation.

In January 2005, the Company sold all of its Argentina operations. At December 31, 2004,
the Argentina operations have been classified as held for sale and presented as discontinued
operations in the consolidated financial statements (See Note 3).

Certain amounts previously reported in the 2003 and 2002 financial statements and notes
thereto were reclassified to conform to the 2004 presentation.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Foreign currency

The financial statements of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries in Argentina and Mexico are
measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these
subsidiaries are translated at exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Revenues and
expenses are translated at average exchange rates in effect during the year. The resulting
cumulative translation adjustment for Mexico has been recorded in other comprehensive income.
The cumulative translation adjustment of $25.1 million for Argentina was recognized in December
2004 in connection with the classification of those operations as held for sale. Realized
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Realized foreign currency transaction (gains) losses were $300 thousand, $(70)
thousand, and $600 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Cash and equivalents

For purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, commercial paper and time
deposits with a maturity of three months or less when acquired are classified as cash
equivalents.

Investments in unconsolidated entities

The equity method of accounting is used for joint ventures and associated entities over
which the Company has significant influence; generally this represents partnership equity or
common stock ownership interests of at least 20% and not more than 50% (See Note 4). Under the
equity method of accounting, the Company recognizes its pro rata share of the profits and
losses of these entities. Certain of these entities sell lots and provide construction
services to the Company. Profits from such activities are deferred by the Company until which
time the related homes are sold.

The cost method of accounting is used for investments in which the Company has less than a
20% ownership interest and does not have the ability to exercise significant influence.

Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Goodwill

On January 1, 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” became effective. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, the
Company does not record amortization expense related to goodwill, but reviews it annually for
impairment.

At December 31, 2004, the majority of goodwill, which represents the cost of acquired
companies in excess of the fair value of the net assets at the acquisition date, resulted from
the acquisition of Del Webb in 2001. All goodwill relates to the Homebuilding segment, except
for $700 thousand, which relates to the Financial Services segment. In accordance with SFAS
No. 142, annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may
not be recoverable, management evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by comparing the
carrying value of the Company’s reporting units to their fair value. Fair value is determined
based on discounted future cash flows. The Company performed its annual impairment test during
the fourth quarter of 2004 and determined there to be no impairment of goodwill.

Intangible assets

Intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks and tradenames acquired in connection
with the 2001 acquisition of Del Webb and are included in the assets of the Homebuilding
segment. These intangible assets were valued at the acquisition date utilizing proven
valuation procedures and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a 20-year life. The
acquired cost and accumulated amortization of the Company’s intangible assets was $163.5
million and $28.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2004, and $163.5 million and $19.8
million, respectively, at December 31, 2003. Amortization expense for the years ended December
31, 2004 and 2003 was $8.3 million, and 2002 amortization expense was $8.2 million, and is
expected to be approximately $8.2 million in each of the next 5 years.

Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators exist, an
assessment of undiscounted future cash flows for the assets related to these intangibles is
evaluated accordingly. If the results of the analysis indicate impairment, the assets are
adjusted to fair market value. During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, there
were no impairments of intangible assets.

Fixed assets and depreciation

Fixed assets are recorded at cost. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to earnings
as incurred. Depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method based upon
estimated useful lives as follows: Vehicles, three to five years, model and office furniture,
two to five years, and equipment, three to ten years. Fixed assets are included in Other
Assets and totaled $130.7 million net of accumulated depreciation of $105.3 million at December
31, 2004 and $91.3 million net of accumulated depreciation of $87.7 million at December 31,
2003. Total depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $38
million, $31.2 million, and $30.8 million, respectively.

Advertising cost

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. For the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company incurred advertising costs of approximately $87.6 million,
$80.6 million and $78.2 million, respectively.

Employee benefits

The Company maintains two defined contribution plans that cover substantially all of the
Company’s employees. Company contributions to the plans are expensed as paid. The total
Company contributions pursuant to the plans were approximately $15 million, $9.5 million and $7
million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.



PULTE HOMES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Insurance

The Company has, and requires the majority of its subcontractors to have general liability
and workers compensation insurance. These insurance policies protect the Company against a
portion of its risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self-insured retentions,
deductibles, and other coverage limits. The Company reserves for costs to cover its
self-insured and deductible amount under those policies and for any costs of claims and
lawsuits in excess of its coverage limits or not covered
by such policies, based on an analysis of the Company’s historical claims, which includes an
estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. The Company’s total reserves for such items
were $115.6 million and $81.1 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Expenses
related to such claims were approximately $58.4 million, $40.9 million, and $25.8 million for
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders
(the “numerator”) by the weighted-average number of common shares, adjusted for nonvested
 shares of restricted stock (the “denominator”) for the period. Computing diluted earnings per
share is similar to basic earnings per share, except that the denominator is increased to
include the dilutive effects of options and nonvested shares of restricted stock. Any options
that have an exercise price greater than the average market price are excluded from the diluted
earnings per share calculation. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, 64,695,
78,316 and 267,272, respectively, of the outstanding stock options were excluded from this
calculation.

Fair values of financial instruments

The carrying amounts of cash and equivalents approximate their fair values due to their
short-term nature.

The fair value of residential mortgage loans available-for-sale is estimated using the
quoted market prices for securities backed by similar loans. Fair value exceeded cost by
approximately $6.9 million and $5.8 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Carrying amounts for financial derivative instruments reported in the balance sheet
approximate fair value as the amounts reported are based on current market prices. The
estimated fair values of financial instruments were determined by management using available
market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is necessary
to interpret the market data and develop the estimated fair value. Accordingly, the estimates
presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize on
disposition of the financial instruments. Changes in the fair value of these instruments would
not have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations. The use of different
market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated
fair value amounts. At December 31, 2004, derivative assets, included in other assets, in the
balance sheet, totaled $3.8 million and derivative liabilities, included in accrued and other
liabilities, totaled $3.5 million. At December 31, 2003, derivative assets totaled $2.7
million and derivative liabilities totaled $3.9 million.

The fair values of subordinated debentures and senior notes are based on quoted market
prices, when available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on
quoted market prices of similar issues.

Disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments are based on pertinent
information available to management as of December 31, 2004. Although management is not aware
of any factors that would significantly affect the reasonableness of the fair value amounts,
such amounts were not comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since
that date and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts
presented herein.

Stock-based compensation

The Company currently has several stock-based employee compensation plans. Effective
January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the preferable fair value recognition provisions of SFAS
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” The Company selected the prospective
method of adoption as permitted by SFAS No. 148,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation –
Transition and Disclosure.” Under the prospective method, the Company recognizes compensation
expense on an accelerated basis over the vesting period based on the fair value provisions of
SFAS No. 123.

Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Stock-based compensation (continued)

Grants made prior to January 1, 2003 continue to be accounted for under the recognition and
measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and
related Interpretations. With the exception of certain variable stock option grants, no
stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income for grants made prior to
January 1, 2003, as all options granted in those years had an exercise price equal to the
market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.

The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the
Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,” to all stock-based employee compensation. The fair value of each
option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model
with the following weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively: weighted-average dividend yields of .33%, .44% and .32%, expected volatility of
36.6%, 35.3% and 34.9%, weighted-average risk-free interest rates of 3.80%, 3.57% and 3.45%,
and weighted-average expected lives of 5.92 years, 6.76 years and 6.82 years.

they would have no impact on pro forma net income as presented.

New accounting pronouncements

On December 15, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123(R),
Share-Based Payment, which amends SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS
No. 123(R) requires that all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
stock options, be accounted for at fair value. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted
under SFAS No. 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition. Under
SFAS No. 123(R), the Company must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for
valuing share-based payments, the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition
method to be used at date of adoption. The Company previously adopted the fair-value-based
method of accounting for share-based payments under SFAS No. 123 effective January 1, 2003
using the prospective method described in SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation—Transition and Disclosure. Currently, the Company uses the Black-Scholes model to
estimate the value of stock options granted to employees and is considering the preferred
lattice model. Because SFAS No. 123(R) must be applied not only to new awards but to
previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the effective date, and because the
company adopted SFAS No. 123 using the prospective transition method (which applied only to
awards granted, modified or settled after the adoption date), compensation cost for some
previously granted awards that were not recognized under SFAS No. 123 will be recognized under
SFAS No. 123(R). SFAS No. 123(R) also amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows, to require
that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of
taxes paid. As originally issued, SFAS No. 95 required all income tax payments to be
classified as operating cash outflows. This statement is effective for fiscal periods
beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company is still evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS No.
123(R).



PULTE HOMES, INC.

Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

New accounting pronouncements (continued)

In March 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) released SEC Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 105 (“SAB 105”), Application of Accounting Principles to Loan
Commitments. SAB 105 provides the SEC staff position regarding the application of accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States to loan commitments that relate to the
origination of mortgage loans held for resale. SAB 105 contains specific guidance on the
inputs to a valuation-recognition model to measure loan commitments accounted for at fair
value. Current accounting guidance requires commitments to be recognized on the balance sheet
at fair value from inception through expiration or funding. SAB 105 requires that fair-value
measurement include only differences between the guaranteed interest rate in the loan
commitment and a market interest rate, excluding any expected future cash flows related to the
customer relationship or loan servicing. In addition, SAB 105 requires the disclosure of both
the accounting policy for loan commitments including the methods and assumptions used to
estimate the fair value of loan commitments and any associated hedging strategies. SAB 105 is
effective for all loan commitments accounted for as derivatives and entered into subsequent to
March 31, 2004. The issuance of SAB 105 did not have a material impact on the Company’s
results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Homebuilding

Inventories

Finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated cost or net realizable value.
Inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost, unless
certain facts indicate such cost would not be recovered from the cash flows generated by future
disposition. In this instance, such inventories are measured at fair value.

Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis. Under the specific
identification basis, cost of sales includes the construction cost of the home, an average lot
cost by project based on land acquisition and development costs, and closing costs and
commissions. Construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of
the home, plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted
construction cost. This accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after
closing compared to the amount accrued, and adjustments are made if needed. Total project land
acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared to actual
costs incurred to date and estimates to complete. Adjustments to estimated total project land
acquisition and development costs for the project affect the amount of future lots costed.

The Company capitalizes interest cost into homebuilding inventories. Each layer of
capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of
communities under development. Interest expense is allocated over the period based on the
cyclical timing of unit settlements. The Company capitalized interest in the amount of $156.1
million, $136.3 million and $123.1 million and expensed to home cost of sales $133 million,
$78.7 million and $48.7 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Land, not owned, under option agreements

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities,” as amended by FIN 46-R issued in December 2003 (collectively referred to as
“FIN 46”). Until this interpretation was issued, a company generally included another entity
in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting
interests. FIN 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that
company is subject to a majority of the expected losses from the variable interest entity’s
activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns. FIN
46 applied immediately to all variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and was
effective in the first interim period ending after December 31, 2003 for variable interest
entities created prior to February 1, 2003.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into land option agreements in
order to procure land for the construction of homes in the future. Pursuant to these land
option agreements, the Company will provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the
right to purchase land at different times in the future, usually at predetermined prices.
Under FIN 46, if the entity holding the land under option is a variable interest entity, the
Company’s deposit represents a variable interest in that entity. Creditors of the variable
interest entities have no recourse against the Company.

In applying the provisions of FIN 46, the Company evaluated all land option agreements
(including those created prior to February 1, 2003) and determined that the Company was subject
to a majority of the expected losses or entitled to receive a majority of the expected residual
returns under a limited number of these agreements. As the primary beneficiary under these
agreements, the Company is required to consolidate variable interest entities at fair value.
At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company classified $106.4 million and $73.3 million,
respectively, as land, not owned, under option agreements on the balance sheet, representing
the fair value of land under contract, including deposits of $18.9 million and $13.9 million,
respectively. The corresponding liability has been classified within accrued and other
liabilities on the balance sheet. The adoption of FIN 46 had no impact on the Company’s
results of operations or cash flows.

Land option agreements that did not require consolidation under FIN 46 at December 31,
2004 and 2003, had a total purchase price of $6.3 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively. In
connection with these agreements, the Company had deposits and advanced costs of $311.7 million
and $172.9 million, included in other assets, as well as letters of credit and surety bonds
posted in lieu of cash deposits at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Land held for sale

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had approximately $230.7 million and $251.2
million of land held for sale related to the Company’s Homebuilding segment. Land held for
sale is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell.

Allowance for warranties

Home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building defects. The
specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary geographically. Most warranties cover
different aspects of the home’s construction and operating systems for a period of up to ten
years. The Company estimates the costs to be incurred under these warranties and records a
liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that
affect the Company’s warranty liability include the number of homes sold, historical and
anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. The Company periodically assesses
the adequacy of its recorded allowance for warranties and adjusts the amount as necessary.

Changes to the Company’s allowance for warranties for the years ended December 31, 2004
and 2003, are as follows ($000’s omitted):

Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Homebuilding (continued)

Revenues

Homebuilding revenues are recorded when the sales of homes are completed and ownership has
transferred to the customer. Unfunded settlements are deposits in transit on homes for which
the sale was completed.

Start-up costs

Costs and expenses associated with entry into new homebuilding markets and opening new
communities in existing markets are expensed when incurred.

Financial Services

Mortgage servicing rights

The Company allocates the cost of mortgage loans originated and purchased between the
mortgage loans and the right to service those mortgage loans, based on relative fair value, on
the date the loan is sold.

The Company sells its servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales
contracts. Due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held, generally less than
four months, the Company does not amortize the servicing asset. Furthermore, there are no
impairment issues since the servicing rights are recorded based on the value in the servicing
sales contracts. The servicing sales contracts provide for the reimbursement of payments made
when loans prepay within specified periods of time, usually 90 days after sale or
securitization. The Company established reserves for this liability of $3.8 million and $4.1
million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, included in accrued and other liabilities,
at the time the sale was recorded. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, total servicing rights
recognized were $25.3 million, $36.7 million, and $35.7 million, respectively.

Residential mortgage loans available-for-sale

Residential mortgage loans available-for-sale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or
market value. Unamortized net mortgage discounts totaled $2.1 million and $1.6 million at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These discounts are not amortized as interest
revenue during the period the loans are held for sale.

Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold. The
Company hedges its residential mortgage loans available-for-sale. Gains and losses from closed
commitments and futures contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on the sale
of mortgage loans. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, net gains from the sale of mortgages were $50.3
million, $64.4 million and $62.4 million, respectively, which have been included in Financial
Services revenue.

Interest income on mortgage loans

Interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is
sold.

Mortgage servicing, origination and commitment fees

Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors.
Servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance, or a
contracted set fee in the case of certain sub-servicing, and are credited to income when
related mortgage payments are received. Loan origination fees, commitment fees and certain
direct loan origination costs are deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the related mortgage
loan until such loan is sold.

Derivative instruments and hedging activities

The Company recognizes all of its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities
in the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains
or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies
as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those
derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must
designate the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as either a fair value
hedge or a cash flow hedge.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Financial Services (continued)

Derivative instruments and hedging activities (continued)

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge (i.e.,
hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified
portion thereof that is attributable to a particular risk), the gain or loss on the derivative
instrument as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged
risk are recognized in current earnings during the period of the change in fair values. For
derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge (i.e., hedging the
exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk), the effective portion of
the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive
income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged
transaction affects earnings. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging
instruments, the gain or loss is recognized in current earnings during the period of change.
The Company currently uses only cash flow hedges.

Market risks arise from commitments to lend, movements in interest rates and cancelled or
modified commitments to lend. In order to reduce these risks, the Company uses derivative
financial instruments. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on
mortgage-backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury futures
contracts, and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage-backed securities. The
Company does not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. A commitment
to lend at a specified interest rate is a derivative instrument (interest rate is locked to the
borrower). When the Company commits to lend to the borrower, the Company enters into one of
the aforementioned derivative financial instruments to economically hedge the rate lock
derivative. The changes in the value of the loan commitment and the derivative financial
instrument are recognized in current earnings during the period of change. At December 31,
2004, commitments by the Company to originate mortgage loans totaled $235.2 million at interest
rates prevailing at the date of commitment.

Since the Company can terminate a loan commitment if the borrower does not comply with the
terms of the contract, and some loan commitments may expire without being drawn upon, these
commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates the
creditworthiness of these transactions through its normal credit policies.

Cash forward placement contracts on mortgage-backed securities are commitments to either
purchase or sell a specified financial instrument at a specified future date for a specified
price and may be settled in cash, by offsetting the position, or through the delivery of the
financial instrument. Options on treasury futures contracts and options on mortgage-backed
securities grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right to either purchase or sell a
specified treasury futures contract or a specified mortgage-backed security, respectively, for
a specified price within a specified period of time or on a specified date from or to the
writer of the option.

Mandatory cash forward contracts on mortgage-backed securities are the predominant
derivative financial instruments used to minimize the market risk during the period from when
the Company extends an interest rate lock to a loan applicant until the time the loan is sold
to an investor. Whole loan investor commitments are obligations of the investor to buy loans
at a specified price within a specified time period. At December 31, 2004, the Company had
unexpired cash forward contracts and whole loan investor commitments of $815.8 million.
Options on cash forward contracts on mortgage-backed securities are used in the same manner as
mandatory cash forward contracts, but provide protection from interest rates rising, while
still allowing an opportunity for profit if interest rates fall. Options on the treasury
futures contracts are used as cross hedges on various loan product types and to protect the
Company in a volatile interest rate environment from unexpected increases, cancellations or
modifications in lending commitments. There were no outstanding options on treasury futures
contracts at December 31, 2004.

The Company enters into derivative instruments to economically hedge portions of its
forecasted cash flow from sales of mortgage-backed securities with derivative financial
instruments. At December 31, 2004, the maximum length of time that the Company was exposed to
the variability in future cash flows of derivative instruments was approximately 75 days.
During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company did not recognize any material net gains
or losses related to an ineffective portion of the hedging instrument. In addition, the
Company did not recognize any material net gains or losses during the year ended December 31,
2004 for cash flow hedges that were discontinued because the forecasted transaction did not
occur. At December 31, 2004, the Company expects to reclassify $138 thousand, net of taxes, of
net gains on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings
during the next twelve months from sales of mortgage-backed securities.

Discontinued operations

First Heights

During the first quarter of 1994, the Company adopted a plan of disposal for First Heights
and announced its strategy to exit the thrift industry and increase its focus on housing and
related mortgage banking. First Heights sold all but one of its 32 bank branches and related
deposits to two unrelated purchasers. The sale was substantially completed during the fourth
quarter of 1994. Although the Company expected to complete the plan of disposal within a
reasonable period of time, contractual disputes precluded the Company from completing the
disposal in accordance with its original plan.

First Heights’ day-to-day activities have been principally devoted to supporting residual
regulatory compliance matters and the litigation with the United States government (See Note
11), and are not reflective of the active operations of the former thrift, such as maintaining
traditional transaction accounts (e.g., checking and savings accounts) or making loans.
Accordingly, such operations are being presented as discontinued.

Revenues of these discontinued operations were $8 thousand, $6 thousand and $17 thousand
for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. For the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, discontinued thrift operations reported after-tax gains of
$10.5 million, $7.3 million and $9 million, respectively. The after-tax gains for the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 include approximately $10.8 million, $7.9 million and
$10 million, respectively, of income related to the recognition of income tax benefits
resulting from the favorable resolution of certain tax matters.

Argentina Operations

In January 2005, the Company sold all of its Argentina operations to an Argentine company
involved in residential and commercial real estate development. The disposition of these
operations was the chosen action to improve the Company’s overall returns. At December 31,
2004, the Argentina operations have been classified as held for sale and presented as
discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. Previously, the Argentina
operations were included in the Homebuilding segment.

Total assets to be disposed of at December 31, 2004 were $15.4 million. These assets
consisted primarily of cash and inventories and have been included in Other Assets. Total
liabilities to be disposed of at December 31, 2004 were $13.7 million and consisted primarily
of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities. The liabilities associated with the
disposal have been classified in accrued and other liabilities.

Revenues of these discontinued operations were $24.6 million, $37 million and $25.9
million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. For the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, discontinued Argentine operations reported pre-tax
losses of $1.4 million, $1.9 million and $200 thousand, respectively. In addition, the Company
recognized a pre-tax loss of $33.2 million ($20.6 million after-tax) on the write-down of the
Argentina operations to fair value less costs to sell. The pre-tax loss includes the
accounting recognition of the economic losses related to accumulated foreign currency
translation adjustments of $25.1 million ($15.6 million after-tax), which have previously been
reported in other comprehensive income.

Investments in unconsolidated entities

The Company participates in a number of joint ventures with independent third parties.
Many of these joint ventures purchase, develop and/or sell land and homes in the United States,
Mexico and Puerto Rico. If additional capital infusions are required and approved, the Company
would need to contribute its pro-rata portion of those capital needs in order not to dilute its
ownership in the joint ventures. During 2004, the Company invested approximately $117.8
million in three new joint ventures that develop and/or sell land within the United States.

During January 2004, the Company invested $35 million for a 50% ownership interest in an
entity that supplies and installs basic building components and operating systems, with an
option to purchase the remaining 50% interest in the entity in July 2006 or earlier under
certain circumstances. The Company has certain commitments to the entity under operating and
supply agreements, including: funding additional working capital, as determined by the
entity’s operating committee on which the Company has 50% representation; and utilization of
products and services of this entity for new homes built within certain markets in the western
United States.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, outstanding debt of these joint ventures amounted to $58.1
million and $72.6 million, respectively. The Company has not guaranteed any of this
outstanding indebtedness.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, we made additional capital contributions to these
joint ventures totaling approximately $44.2 million and received cash distributions from these
entities totaling approximately $66.1 million. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had
approximately $237.6 million and $52 million, respectively, invested in these joint ventures.
These investments are included in the assets of the Company’s Homebuilding segment.

The Company also owns 22.2% of the capital stock of a mortgage banking company in Mexico.
At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company’s investment in this entity, which is included in
the assets of the Financial Services segment, was approximately $21.1 million and $17.2
million, respectively. The Company does not have any purchase or investment commitments to
this entity. Furthermore, the Company has not guaranteed any of the indebtedness of this
entity, which approximated $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Other financing arrangements

Corporate/Homebuilding

In September 2004, the Company restructured and amended the 5-year unsecured revolving
credit facility, increasing the borrowing availability from $850 million to $1.31 billion,
extending the maturity date from September 30, 2008 to September 15, 2009, with pricing more
favorable to the Company. The credit facility includes an uncommitted accordion feature, under
which the credit facility may be increased to $1.5 billion. The Company has the capacity to
issue letters of credit up to $750 million. Borrowing availability is reduced by the amount of
letters of credit outstanding. The credit facility contains restrictive covenants, the most
restrictive of which requires the Company not to exceed a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of
50% as defined in the agreement.

Other financing arrangements (continued)

Financial Services

Notes payable to banks (collateralized short-term debt) are secured by residential
mortgage loans available-for-sale. The carrying amounts of such borrowings approximate fair
value.

Pulte Mortgage supports its operations through the use of a revolving credit facility and
an asset-backed commercial paper conduit. In July 2004, Pulte Mortgage expanded the capacity
on its revolving credit facility from $355 million to $390 million. The revolving credit
facility expires in June 2006. In September 2004, Pulte Mortgage amended its commercial paper
conduit, which is a $550 million committed line of credit. The amendment increased a sub-limit
for eligible collateral, eliminated the $50 million quarterly accordion feature, and made
pricing more favorable to Pulte Mortgage. Pulte Mortgage can extend the asset-backed
commercial paper conduit to August 2006, subject to approval by the administrative agent. The
bank credit agreements contain restrictive covenants, the most restrictive of which requires
Pulte Mortgage to maintain a minimum tangible net worth of $30 million and adjusted liabilities
cannot exceed 12 times adjusted net worth.

During the three years ended December 31, 2004, Pulte Mortgage provided compensating
balances, in the form of escrows and other custodial funds, in order to further reduce interest
rates.

Various state net operating losses aggregating $71.7 million expire in years 2013 through
2023. International net operating losses of $50.4 million will expire in years 2008 through
2014. Net operating losses are generally available to offset the Company’s taxable income in
future years. State credit carryforwards include a state credit voucher of $10.8 million that
is expected to be realized by the Company no later than 2006. Realization of the net deferred
tax asset, in certain jurisdictions, is dependent on future reversals of existing taxable
temporary differences and adequate future taxable income. Although realization is not assured,
management believes that, except for the valuation allowance stated, it is more likely than not
that the net deferred tax asset will be realized.

Income taxes (continued)

The Company has not provided income taxes on undistributed earnings of its foreign
subsidiaries as they are considered to be permanently reinvested. Although the Company is
evaluating the potential repatriation of the earnings of its foreign subsidiaries in the future
in the context of new IRC Section 965, the range of income tax effects of such repatriation, if
any, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The evaluation is expected to be completed
during 2005.

Leases

The Company leases certain property and equipment under non-cancelable leases. Office and
equipment leases are generally for terms of three to five years and generally provide renewal
options for terms of up to an additional three years. Model home leases are generally for
shorter terms approximating one year with renewal options on a month-to-month basis. In most
cases, management expects that in the normal course of business, leases that expire will be
renewed or replaced by other leases. The future minimum lease payments required under operating
leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year are as follows
($000’s omitted):

Net rental expense for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $57.1 million,
$49.6 million and $48.8 million, respectively. Certain leases contain purchase options and
generally provide that the Company shall pay for insurance, taxes and maintenance.

11.

Commitments and contingencies

In the normal course of business, the Company acquires rights under options or option-type
agreements to purchase land to be used in homebuilding operations at future dates. The total
purchase price applicable to land under option that has been approved for purchase approximated
$4.1 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The total purchase
price applicable to land under option that has not been approved for purchase approximated $2.4
billion and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company, in the normal course of business, had
outstanding letters of credit and performance bonds of $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion,
respectively.



PULTE HOMES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

11.

Commitments and contingencies (continued)

The Company could be required to repurchase loans sold to investors that have not been
underwritten in accordance with the investor guidelines (“defective loans”). The Company, in
the normal course of business, indemnifies investors for defective loans that they have
purchased. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had been notified of $6.6 million and
$8.6 million of defective loans, respectively. The Company assesses the risk of loss on these
indemnifications and establishes reserves for them. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, reserves for
indemnification on defective loans are reflected in accrued and other liabilities and amounted
to $400 thousand and $300 thousand, respectively.

The Company is involved in various litigation incidental to its continuing business
operations. Management does not believe that this litigation will have a material adverse
impact on the results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.

Storm Water Discharge Practices

In April 2004, the Company received a request for information from the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) pursuant to Section 308 of the Clean Water Act. The
request seeks information about storm water discharge practices in connection with homebuilding
projects completed or underway by the Company. The Company has provided the EPA with this
information. Although the matter has since been referred to the United States Department of
Justice (“DOJ”) for enforcement, the EPA has asked that the Company engage in “pre-filing”
negotiations to resolve the matter short of litigation. The Company is actively engaged in
these negotiations. If the negotiations fail and the DOJ alleges that the Company has violated
regulatory requirements applicable to storm water discharges, the government may seek injunctive
relief and penalties. The Company believes that it has defenses to any such allegations. At
this time, however, the Company can neither predict the outcome of this inquiry, nor can it
currently estimate the costs that may be associated with its eventual resolution.

First Heights-related litigation

Pulte Homes, Inc. is a party to a lawsuit relating to First Heights’ 1988 acquisition from
the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (“FSLIC”) and First Heights’ ownership of
five failed Texas thrifts. The lawsuit (the Court of Federal Claims Case) was filed on December
26, 1996, in the United States Court of Federal Claims (Washington, D.C.) by Pulte Homes, Inc.,
Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc. and First Heights (collectively, the Pulte Parties) against
the United States.

In the Court of Federal Claims Case, the Pulte Parties assert breaches of contract on the
part of the United States in connection with the enactment of Section 13224 of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (“OBRA”). That provision repealed portions of the tax
benefits that the Pulte Parties claim they were entitled to under the contract to acquire the
failed Texas thrifts. The Pulte Parties also assert other claims concerning the contract,
including that the United States (through the FDIC as receiver) improperly attempted to amend
the failed thrifts’ pre-acquisition tax returns and that this attempt was made in an effort to
deprive the Pulte Parties of tax benefits for which they had contracted.

On August 17, 2001, the United States Court of Federal Claims ruled that the United States
government is liable to the Pulte Parties for breach of contract by enacting Section 13224 of
OBRA. In September 2003, the United States Court of Federal Claims issued final judgment that
the Pulte Parties had been damaged by approximately $48.7 million as a result of the United
States government’s breach of contract with them. The United States government and the Pulte
Parties appealed the final judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit in October 2003. Accordingly, any gain related to this litigation will be recognized
only upon final resolution.

Supplemental Guarantor information

At December 31, 2004, Pulte Homes, Inc. had the following outstanding senior note

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Pulte Homes, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pulte Homes, Inc. (the
“Company”) as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Pulte Homes, Inc. at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of Pulte Homes, Inc.’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated January 31, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed in
2003 its method of accounting for stock options.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

This Item is not applicable.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Management, including our President & Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President &
Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of December 31, 2004. Based upon, and as of the date of that evaluation,
our President & Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

(a)

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated
financial statements included in this annual report. The consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles
and reflect management’s judgments and estimates concerning events and transactions that are
accounted for or disclosed.

Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that pertain to the Company’s ability to record, process,
summarize and report reliable financial data. Management recognizes that there are inherent
limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control and effective internal control over
financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation. Additionally, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting may vary over time.

In order to ensure that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
effective, management regularly assesses such controls and did so most recently for its
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. Management’s assessment was based on criteria for
effective internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Based on this assessment, management asserts that the Company has maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004.

Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the
Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, has issued an
attestation report on management’s assertion with respect to the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004.



Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (continued)

b)

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Pulte Homes, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Pulte Homes, Inc. maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria
established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Pulte Homes, Inc.’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting
was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Pulte Homes, Inc. maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Pulte Homes, Inc. maintained, in
all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2004, based on the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Pulte Homes, Inc. as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2004 of Pulte Homes, Inc. and our report dated January 31, 2005 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the

materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
