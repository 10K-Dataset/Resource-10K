PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Pulte Homes, Inc.

Pulte Homes, Inc. is a publicly held holding company whose subsidiaries
engage in the homebuilding and financial services businesses. Our assets
consist principally of the capital stock of our subsidiaries, cash and
investments. Our income primarily consists of dividends from our subsidiaries
and interest on investments. Our direct subsidiaries include Pulte Diversified
Companies, Inc., Del Webb Corporation (Del Webb) and other subsidiaries engaged
in the homebuilding business. Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc.’s operating
subsidiaries include Pulte Home Corporation, Pulte International Corporation
(International) and other subsidiaries engaged in the homebuilding business.
Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc.’s non-operating thrift subsidiary, First
Heights Bank, fsb (First Heights), is classified as a discontinued operation
(see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We also have a
mortgage banking company, Pulte Mortgage LLC (Pulte Mortgage), which is a
subsidiary of Pulte Home Corporation.

We have two reportable business segments, Homebuilding and Financial
Services, and one non-operating segment, Corporate. The Homebuilding segment
consists of the following two business units:

•

Domestic Homebuilding, our core business, is engaged in the
acquisition and development of land principally for residential purposes
within the continental United States and the construction of housing on
such land targeted for the first-time, first and second move-up, and
active adult home buyers.

•

International Homebuilding is primarily engaged in the acquisition
and development of land principally for residential purposes, and the
construction of housing on such land in Mexico, Puerto Rico and
Argentina.

The Financial Services segment consists principally of mortgage banking
and title operations conducted through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries.

Corporate is a non-operating segment that supports the operations of our
subsidiaries by acting as the internal source of financing, developing and
implementing strategic initiatives centered on new business development and
operating efficiencies, and providing the administrative support associated
with being a publicly traded entity listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

Financial information, including revenue, pre-tax income and total assets
of each of our business segments is included in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.



Homebuilding Operations

Note:

Homebuilding settlement revenues of affiliates, not included in the
table above, for the years ended December 31, 2003 through 1999 were
$32,511, $40,723, $180,621, $148,798, and $162,926, respectively.
Homebuilding unit settlements of affiliates, not included in the table
above, for the years ended December 31, 2003 through 1999 were 149,
1,022, 7,258, 7,718, and 6,791, respectively.

Settlements (home sales) and net new orders (orders for homes net of
cancellations) in any year are strongly influenced by local, regional and
national market economic conditions. Backlog (homes that have been ordered but
not completed and sold) at any period is strongly influenced by local, regional
and national market economic conditions.

Domestic Homebuilding

We build a wide variety of homes, including single family detached units,
townhouses, condominiums and duplexes, with varying prices, models, options and
lot sizes. Since 1990, we have more than quadrupled our annual unit closings,
unit orders and unit backlog levels. Including 2003 settlements of nearly
33,000 homes, we have closed more than 370,000 homes since our inception.

On July 31, 2001, we merged with Del Webb in a tax-free stock-for-stock
transaction. Del Webb was primarily a homebuilder with operations in seven
states. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, Del Webb reported net income
of $91.2 million on revenues of $1.9 billion and 7,038 unit settlements.
Backlog reported at June 30, 2001, was 3,682 units valued at approximately $994
million. This merger expanded and supported our leadership position. In
particular, we believe the merger strengthened our position among active adult
(55 and better) homebuyers, added important strategic land positions, provided
operational savings from economies of scale, bolstered our purchasing leverage,
and enhanced our overall competitive position. In accordance with our
operational strategy, we will continue to evaluate available strategic
acquisition opportunities that are consistent with our long-range goals.

As of December 31, 2003, our Domestic Homebuilding operations offered
homes for sale in 535 communities at sales prices ranging from $80,000 to
$2,300,000. Sales prices of homes currently offered for sale in 75% of our
communities fall within the range of $100,000 to $350,000 with a 2003 average
unit selling price of $259,000. Sales of single-family detached homes, as a
percentage of total unit sales, were 83% in 2003, 86% in 2002, and 82% in 2001.
Our Domestic Homebuilding operations are geographically diverse and, as a
result, better insulate us from demand changes in individual markets. As of
December 31, 2003, our Domestic Homebuilding business operated in 44 markets
spanning 27 states.

As of December 31, 2003, our Domestic Homebuilding operations had 13,952
units in backlog valued at approximately $4.1 billion.

International Homebuilding

Our International Homebuilding operations are principally conducted
through subsidiaries of International in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Argentina.
International Homebuilding product offerings focus on the demand of first-time
buyers and middle-to-upper income consumer groups. Effective January 1, 2002,
International reorganized its structure within Mexico to create a single
company, Pulte Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V., which ranks as one of the largest
builders in the country. Prior to the reorganization, these operations were
conducted primarily through five joint ventures throughout Mexico. Under the
new ownership structure, which combines the largest of these entities, we own
63.8% of Pulte Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V. and have consolidated Pulte Mexico S.
de R.L. de C.V. into our financial statements.

We are currently in the process of evaluating various long-term strategic
alternatives with regard to our International operations.



Homebuilding Operations (continued)

Land acquisition and development

We select locations for development of homebuilding communities after
completing extensive market research, enabling us to match the location and
product offering with our targeted consumer group. We consider factors such as
proximity to developed areas, population and job growth patterns and, if
applicable, estimated development costs. We historically have managed the risk
of controlling our land positions through use of option contracts and outright
acquisition. We typically control land with the intent to complete sales of
housing units within 24 to 36 months from the date of opening a community,
except in the case of certain active adult developments and our Del Webb
operations for which the completion of community build out requires a longer
time period due to typically larger project sizes. As a result, land is
generally purchased after it is properly zoned and developed or is ready for
development. In addition, we dispose of owned land not required in the
business through sales to appropriate end users. Where we develop land, we
engage directly in many phases of the development process, including land and
site planning, obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals, as well
as constructing roads, sewers, water and drainage facilities and other
amenities. We use our staff and the services of independent engineers and
consultants for land development activities. Land development work is
performed primarily by independent contractors and local government authorities
who construct sewer and water systems in some areas. At December 31, 2003, we
controlled approximately 257,000 lots, of which 120,000 were owned and 137,000
were under option agreements.

Sales and marketing

We are dedicated to improving the quality and value of our domestic homes
through innovative proprietary architectural and community designs and
state-of-the-art customer marketing techniques. Analyzing various qualitative
and quantitative data obtained through extensive market research, we segment
our potential customers into well-defined buyer profiles. Segmentation
analysis provides a method for understanding the business opportunities and
risks across the full spectrum of consumer groups in each market. Once the
demands of potential buyers are understood, we link our home design and
community development efforts to the specific lifestyle of each targeted
consumer group.

To meet the demands of our various domestic customers, we have established
a solid design expertise for a wide array of product lines. We believe that we
are an innovator in the design of our homes and we view design capacity as an
integral aspect of our marketing strategy. Our in-house architectural services
teams and management, supplemented by outside consultants, are successful in
creating distinctive design features, both in exterior facades and interior
options and features. In certain markets our strategy is to offer “the
complete house” in which all features shown in the home are included in the
sales price. Standard features typically offered include vaulted ceilings,
appliances, and a variety of available flooring and carpet.

Typically, our domestic sales teams, together with outside sales brokers,
are responsible for guiding the customer through the sales process. We are
committed to industry-leading customer service through a variety of quality
initiatives, including the customer care program, which ensures that homeowners
are comfortable at every stage of the building process. Using a seven-step,
interactive process, homeowners are kept informed during their homebuilding and
home owning experience. The steps include (1) a pre-construction meeting with
the superintendent; (2) pre-dry wall frame walk; (3) quality assurance
inspection; (4) first homeowner orientation; (5) 30-day follow-up after the
close of the home; (6) three-month follow-up; and (7) an 11-month quality list
after the close of the home. Fully furnished and landscaped model homes are
used to showcase our homes and their distinctive design features. We have
great success with the first-time buyer in the low to moderate price range; in
such cases, financing under United States Government-insured and guaranteed
programs is often used and is facilitated through our mortgage company. We
also enjoy strong sales to the move-up buyer and, in certain markets, offer
semi-custom homes in higher price ranges.

As a result of the Del Webb merger, we are better able to address the
needs of active adults, the fastest growing homebuying segment. With
destination communities offering highly amenitized products such as golf
courses, recreational centers and educational classes, the active adult buyer
has many options to maintain an active lifestyle.



Homebuilding Operations (continued)

Sales and marketing (continued)

In 2003, our Dallas, Houston, Las Vegas, Minneapolis/St. Paul, San
Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, Raleigh/Durham, Sacramento, Southern California,
Tampa, Tucson, and Palm Beach markets were recognized for ranking the highest
in their markets in a national customer satisfaction study. The survey of
twenty-one U. S. markets noted customer service and home readiness as the two
factors that most heavily influenced the customer’s overall level of
satisfaction. We ranked third or better in seventeen of the twenty-one markets
surveyed. Building on this quality foundation is our brand development program
with our “Three I’s on Quality” (Involvement, Integrity, and Innovation)
platform. Developing the Pulte Homes brand and leveraging the strength of the
“DiVosta,” “Del Webb” and “Sun City” tradenames helps to distinguish our
communities from the competition, and can often be rewarded with the advantages
of additional sales pace, choice community locations, and reduced overall
customer acquisition costs.

In addition, our Homeowner for Life™ strategy and philosophy has
increased our business from those who have previously owned a Pulte home or
have been referred by a Pulte homeowner by ensuring a positive home buying and
home owning experience. We introduce our homes to prospective buyers through a
variety of media advertising, illustrated brochures, Internet listings and link
placements, and other advertising displays. In addition, our websites,

www.pulte.com, www.delwebb.com,

and

www.divosta.com

provide tools to help users
find a home that meets their needs, investigate financing alternatives,
communicate moving plans, maintain a home, learn more about us and communicate
directly with us. Approximately three million potential customers visited our
websites during 2003.

Our international sales and marketing efforts focus on the identification
of underserved market demand, particularly in Argentina and Puerto Rico, with
strong emphasis on quality initiatives and customer service. In Mexico, where
our product is focused largely on social interest housing, sales and marketing
efforts target areas experiencing population and employment (industrialization)
growth.

Construction

The construction process for our domestic homes begins with the in-house
design of the homes we sell. The building phase is conducted under the
supervision of our on-site construction superintendents. The construction work
is usually performed by independent contractors under contracts that, in many
instances, cover both labor and materials on a fixed-price basis. We believe
that Pulte Preferred Partnerships (P


), an extension of our quality assurance
program, continues to establish new standards for contractor relations. Using
a selective process, we have teamed up with what we believe are premier
contractors and suppliers to improve all aspects of the land development and
house construction processes.

We maintain efficient construction operations by using standard materials
and components from a variety of sources and, when possible, by building on
contiguous lots. To minimize the effects of changes in construction costs, the
contracting and purchasing of building supplies and materials generally is
negotiated at or near the time when related sales contracts are signed. In
addition, we leverage our size by actively negotiating our materials needs on a
national or regional basis to minimize production component cost. We are also
working to establish a more integrated system that can effectively link
suppliers, contractors and the production schedule through various strategic
business partnerships and e-business initiatives.

Housing in Mexico and Puerto Rico consists primarily of reinforced poured
concrete, concrete and ceramic block and/or brick construction with flat roofs
and public water, electric and sanitary system connections. Our housing
product in Argentina is designed and constructed in a similar fashion to our
domestic product but is customized for local preferences. Building materials,
supplies and components are sourced locally and the construction work is
performed by general contractors and/or independent contractors, which in many
cases include both labor and materials.

We cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials will
be available at reasonable prices in the future and have, on occasion,
experienced shortages of skilled labor in certain trades and of building
materials in some markets.



Homebuilding Operations (continued)

Competition and other factors

Our dedication to customer satisfaction is evidenced by our consumer and
value-based brand approach to product development, and is something that we
believe distinguishes us in the homebuilding industry and contributes to our
long-term competitive advantage. The housing industry in the United States,
however, is highly competitive. In each of our market areas, there are
numerous homebuilders with which we compete. We also compete with the resales
of existing house inventory. Any provider of housing units, for-sale or to
rent, including apartment builders, may be considered a competitor. Conversion
of apartments to condominiums further provides certain segments of the
population an alternative to traditional housing, as does manufactured housing.
We compete primarily on the basis of price, reputation, design, location and
quality of our homes. The housing industry is affected by a number of economic
and other factors including: (1) significant national and world events, which
impact consumer confidence; (2) changes in interest rates; (3) changes in other
costs associated with home ownership, such as property taxes and energy costs;
(4) various demographic factors; (5) changes in federal income tax laws; (6)
changes in government mortgage financing programs, and (7) availability of
sufficient mortgage capacity. In addition to these factors, our business and
operations could be affected by shifts in demand for new homes.

Our operations are subject to building, environmental and other
regulations of various federal, state, local and foreign governing authorities.
For our homes to qualify for Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or Veterans
Administration (VA) mortgages, we must satisfy valuation standards and site,
material and construction requirements of those agencies. Our compliance with
federal, state, local and foreign laws relating to protection of the
environment has had, to date, no material effect upon capital expenditures,
earnings or competitive position. More stringent requirements could be imposed
in the future on homebuilders and developers, thereby increasing the cost of
compliance.

Financial Services Operations

We conduct our financial services business, which includes mortgage and
title operations, through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries.

Mortgage banking

Our mortgage bank arranges financing through the origination of mortgage
loans primarily for the benefit of our domestic homebuyers, but also services
the general public. We also engage in the sale of such loans and the related
servicing rights. We are a lender approved by the FHA and VA and are a
seller/servicer approved by Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA),
Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation (FHLMC) and other investors. In our conventional mortgage lending
activities we follow underwriting guidelines established by FNMA and FHLMC.

Our mortgage underwriting, processing and closing functions are
centralized in Denver, Colorado using a mortgage operations center (MOC)
concept. We also use a centralized telephone loan officer concept where loan
officers are centrally located at a mortgage application center (MAC) in
Denver. Our sales representatives, who are the mortgage customers’ main
contact, forward the loan applications to a MAC loan counselor who calls the
customer to complete the loan application and then forwards it to the MOC for
processing. We believe both the MOC and the MAC improve the speed and
efficiency of our mortgage operations, thereby improving our profitability and
allowing us to focus on creating attractive mortgage financing opportunities
for our customers.

In originating mortgage loans, we initially use our own funds and
borrowings made available to us through various credit arrangements.
Subsequently, we sell such mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities to
outside investors.

Our capture rate for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 was
approximately 83%, 78%, and 74%, respectively. Our capture rate represents
loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percent of total loan
opportunities, excluding cash settlements, from our homebuilding business.
During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, we originated mortgage
loans for approximately 73%, 68% and 67%, respectively, of the homes we sold
domestically. Such originations represented 83%, 85% and 81%, respectively, of
our originations.

We sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing
sales contracts to reduce the risks inherent in servicing loans. This strategy
results in owning the servicing rights for only a short period of time,
generally less than four months after the loan is originated, which
substantially reduces the risk of impairment with respect to the fair value of
these reported assets. The servicing sales contracts provide for the
reimbursement of payments made when loans prepay within specified periods of
time, usually 90 days after sale or securitization.



Financial Services Operations (continued)

Mortgage banking (continued)

The mortgage industry in the United States is highly competitive. We
compete with other mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide
attractive mortgage financing to both our homebuyers and to the general public.
The Internet is also an important resource for homebuyers in obtaining
financing as a number of companies provide online approval for their customers.
These Internet-based mortgage companies may also be considered competitors.

In originating and servicing mortgage loans, we are subject to rules and
regulations of the FHA, VA, GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC. In addition to being
affected by changes in these programs, our mortgage banking business is also
affected by several of the same factors that impact our homebuilding business.

Discontinued operations

During the first quarter of 1994, we adopted a plan of disposal for First
Heights and announced our strategy to exit the thrift industry and increase our
focus on housing and related mortgage banking. First Heights sold all but one
of its 32 bank branches and related deposits to two unrelated purchasers. The
sale was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 1994.

Although in 1994, we expected to complete the plan of disposal within a
reasonable period of time, contractual disputes with the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) prevented the prepayment of the Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corporation Resolution Fund (FRF) notes, thereby precluding
us from completing the disposal in accordance with our original plan. To
provide liquidity for the sale, First Heights liquidated its investment
portfolios and its single-family residential loan portfolio and, as provided in
the Assistance Agreement, entered into a Liquidity Assistance Note (LAN) with
the FDIC acting in its capacity as manager of the FRF notes. The LAN was
collateralized by the FRF notes. The LAN and FRF notes matured in September
1998; however, payment of these obligations was withheld by both parties
pending resolution of all open matters with the FDIC. As discussed in Item 3,
we settled the litigation with the FDIC in October 2001, and as part of that
settlement all obligations under the LAN and FRF notes were extinguished.

First Heights’ day-to-day activities are principally devoted to supporting
residual regulatory compliance matters and the litigation with the United
States government, discussed in Item 3, and are not reflective of the active
operations of the former thrift, such as maintaining traditional transaction
accounts (e.g., checking and savings accounts) or making loans. Accordingly,
such operations are presented as discontinued.

Corporate

Corporate is a non-operating segment that is comprised primarily of Pulte
Homes, Inc. and Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc., both of which are holding
companies. The primary purpose of Corporate is to support the operations of
our subsidiaries by acting as the internal source of financing, developing and
implementing strategic initiatives centered around new business development and
operating efficiencies. Business development activities include the pursuit of
additional domestic and international opportunities as well as the development
of innovative building components and processes. Corporate also includes the
activities associated with supporting a publicly traded entity listed on the
New York Stock Exchange.

Corporate assets include equity investments in its subsidiaries,
short-term financial instruments and affiliate advances. Liabilities include
senior and subordinated debt and income taxes. Corporate revenues consist
primarily of investment earnings of excess funds, while its expenses include
costs associated with supporting a publicly traded company and its
subsidiaries’ operations, and investigating strategic initiatives.

Organization/Employees

All subsidiaries and operating units operate independently with respect to
daily operations. Homebuilding real estate purchases and other significant
homebuilding, mortgage banking, financing activities and similar operating
decisions must be approved by the business unit and/or corporate senior
management.

At December 31, 2003, we employed approximately 10,800 persons. Our
employees are not represented by any union. Contracted work, however, may be
performed by union contractors. Homebuilding and mortgage banking management
personnel are paid performance bonuses and incentive compensation. Performance
bonuses are based on individual performance while incentive compensation is
based on the performance of the applicable business unit or subsidiary. Our
corporate management personnel are paid incentive compensation based on our
overall performance. Each subsidiary is given autonomy regarding employment of
personnel, although our senior corporate management acts in an advisory
capacity in the employment of subsidiary officers. We consider our employee
and contractor relations to be satisfactory.



ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Our homebuilding and corporate headquarters are located at 100 Bloomfield
Hills Parkway, Suite 300, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan 48304, where we lease
63,740 square feet of office space. We also lease 37,004 square feet of office
space at 15333 N. Pima Rd., Suite 300/340/345, Scottsdale, Arizona 85250 and
41,208 square feet of office space at 1230 West Washington Street, Tempe,
Arizona 85281 for certain corporate and business services. Pulte Mortgage’s
offices are located at 7475 South Joliet Street, Englewood, Colorado 80112 and
99 Inverness Drive East, Englewood, Colorado 80112. We lease approximately
61,436 square feet and 32,000 square feet, respectively, of office space at
these locations. Our homebuilding markets and mortgage branch operations
generally lease office space for their day-to-day operations. First Heights’
administrative office is located in 918 square feet of leased space at 2010
North Loop West, Suite 220, Houston, Texas 77018.

Because of the nature of our homebuilding operations, significant amounts
of property are held as inventory in the ordinary course of our homebuilding
business. Such properties are not included in response to this Item.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are involved in various litigation incidental to our continuing
business operations. We believe that none of this litigation will have a
material adverse impact on our results of operations, our financial position or
our cash flows.

First Heights-related litigation

We were a party to three lawsuits relating to First Heights’ 1988
acquisition from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) and
First Heights’ ownership of five failed Texas thrifts. The first lawsuit (the
District Court Case) was filed on July 7, 1995, in the United States District
Court, Eastern District of Michigan, by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) against Pulte Homes, Inc., Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc.
and First Heights (collectively, the Pulte Parties). The second lawsuit (the
Court of Federal Claims Case) was filed on December 26, 1996, in the United
States Court of Federal Claims (Washington, D.C.) by the Pulte Parties against
the United States. The third lawsuit was filed by First Heights on January 10,
2000, in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Michigan against
the FDIC regarding the amounts, including interest, the FDIC was obligated to
pay First Heights on two promissory notes which had been executed by the FDIC’s
predecessor, the FSLIC.

In the District Court Case, the FDIC, as successor to the FSLIC, sought a
declaration of rights and other relief related to the Assistance Agreement
entered into between First Heights and the FSLIC. The FDIC and the Pulte
Parties disagreed about the proper interpretation of provisions in the
Assistance Agreement which provide for sharing of certain tax benefits achieved
in connection with First Heights’ 1988 acquisition and ownership of the five
failed Texas thrifts. The District Court Case also included certain other
claims relating to the foregoing, including claims resulting from our amendment
and First Heights’ amendment of a tax sharing and allocation agreement between
us and First Heights. The Pulte Parties disputed the FDIC’s claims and filed
an answer and a counterclaim, seeking, among other things, a declaration that
the FDIC had breached the Assistance Agreement in numerous respects. On
December 24, 1996, the Pulte Parties voluntarily dismissed without prejudice
certain of their claims in the District Court Case and, on December 26, 1996,
initiated the Court of Federal Claims Case.

In October 2001, the FDIC and the Pulte Parties settled the District Court
Case, the related appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and the third
lawsuit. As part of this settlement (the Settlement), the First Heights
Assistance Agreement was terminated, except that certain tax benefit sharing
provisions will continue in effect, and the warrants issued by First Heights to
the FDIC were extinguished. We do not believe that the claims in the Court of
Federal Claims Case are in any way prejudiced by the Settlement.

In the Court of Federal Claims Case, the Pulte Parties assert breaches of
contract on the part of the United States in connection with the enactment of
Section 13224 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA). That
provision repealed portions of the tax benefits that the Pulte Parties claim
they were entitled to under the contract to acquire the failed Texas thrifts.
The Pulte Parties also assert other claims concerning the contract, including
that the United States (through the FDIC as receiver) improperly attempted to
amend the failed thrifts’ pre-acquisition tax returns and that this attempt was
made in an effort to deprive the Pulte Parties of tax benefits for which they
had contracted.

On August 17, 2001, the United States Court of Federal Claims ruled that
the United States government is liable to the Pulte Parties for breach of
contract by enacting Section 13224 of OBRA. In September 2003, the United
States Court of Federal Claims issued final judgment that the Pulte Parties
have been damaged by approximately $48.7 million as a result of the United
States government’s breach of contract with them. The United States government
and the Pulte Parties filed Notices of Appeal with the United States Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit in October 2003. Accordingly, any gain related
to this litigation will be recognized only upon final resolution.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

A summary of our operating results by business segment for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 is as follows ($000’s omitted, except per
share data):

A comparison of pre-tax income (loss), for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 is as follows:

•

Continued strong demand for new housing, the addition and expansion
of the Del Webb branded communities, coupled with our ability to
effectively manage selling price and pace through our unique
segmentation strategy drove pre-tax income of our homebuilding business
segment to increase 38% in 2003 and 41% in 2002. Domestic average unit
selling price increased by 7% in 2003 and 8% in 2002. Additionally,
domestic gross margin percentages from home sales were up 120 basis
points in 2003 principally as a result of product price increases and
market and product mix shifts. Compared to 2001, our 2002 domestic
gross margin percentages were up 30 basis points principally as a
result of purchase accounting adjustments recorded in 2001.

•

Pre-tax income of our financial services business segment increased
3% in 2003 and 81% in 2002. The increase in 2003 was primarily driven
by an increase in loan originations and a higher capture rate tempered
by a less favorable interest rate environment during the last half of
the year. The 2002 increase was a result of increased volume, a
favorable interest rate environment, effective leverage of overhead
costs and the addition of Del Webb mortgage operations.

•

Pre-tax loss of our non-operating corporate segment increased 22%
in 2003 to $75.4 million principally from higher compensation-related
costs. The pre-tax loss in 2002 increased 8% as a result of higher
interest costs, related to an increase in debt levels to support the
growth of the business.

During the third quarter of 2003 and 2002, we recorded non-cash, after-tax
gains of $7.9 million and $10.0 million, respectively, related to the favorable
resolution of certain tax matters relating to our thrift operation, which we
discontinued in 1994.



Homebuilding

Our Homebuilding segment consists of the following operations:

•

Domestic Homebuilding - We conduct our Domestic Homebuilding
operations in 44 markets located throughout 27 states. Domestic
Homebuilding offers a broad product line to meet the needs of the
first-time, first and second move-up, and active adult homebuyers.

•

International Homebuilding - We conduct our International
Homebuilding operations through subsidiaries of Pulte International
Corporation (International) in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Argentina.
International Homebuilding product offerings focus on the demand of
first-time buyers and middle-to-upper income consumer groups. We are
currently in the process of evaluating various long-term strategic
alternatives with regard to our International operations.

Certain operating data relating to our homebuilding operations are as
follows ($000’s omitted):

Note:

Homebuilding revenues of affiliates, not included in the
table above, for the years ended December 31, 2003 through 2001
were $32,511, $40,723, and $180,621, respectively. Homebuilding
unit settlements of affiliates, not included in the table above,
for the years ended December 31, 2003 through 2001 were 149, 1,022,
and 7,258, respectively.

Domestic Homebuilding

The Domestic Homebuilding operations represent our core business. We
conduct our operations in 44 markets, located throughout 27 states, presented
geographically as follows:

Northeast:

Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey,

New York, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Virginia

Southeast:

Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee

Midwest:

Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio

Central:

Colorado, Texas, New Mexico

West:

Arizona, California, Nevada

The greater Phoenix market accounted for 11% of Domestic Homebuilding
settlement revenues, 12% of settlement units and 14% of net new orders in 2003.
The Las Vegas market accounted for 10% of net new orders in 2003. For the
year ended December 31, 2002, the greater Phoenix market accounted for 10% of
Domestic Homebuilding settlement revenues, 11% of settlement units and 11% of
net new orders. No other individual markets represented more than 10% of total
Domestic Homebuilding settlement revenues, settlement units or net new orders
during the three years ended December 31, 2003.



Homebuilding (continued)

Domestic Homebuilding (continued)

The following table presents selected unit information for our Domestic
Homebuilding operations:

(a)

Net new orders for the years ended December 31, 2003
and 2001, do not include 1,051 units and 3,953 units,
respectively, of acquired backlog and related dollars.

Unit settlements in 2003 reached a record high, increasing 13% to 32,693
units. The increase in 2003 can be attributed to continued strong demand for
new housing and an increase in the active communities to 535 from 460. Unit
settlements in 2002 increased 26% to 28,903 units, principally from the
inclusion of a full year of Del Webb operations combined with strong sales in
the Midwest. The average selling price for our homes increased from $225,000
in 2001 to $242,000 in 2002 and to $259,000 in the current year. Changes in
average selling price reflect a number of factors, including price increases,
the mix of product closed during a period and the number of options purchased
by customers. Both 2003 and 2002 benefited from increased product prices and
improved product mix.

Ending backlog, which represents orders for homes that have not yet
closed, climbed 32% to 13,952 homes. The dollar value of our ending backlog
was up 45% to $4.1 billion at December 31, 2003. Unit and dollar backlog at
December 31, 2002, increased 22% and 35%, respectively, to 10,605 homes valued
at $2.9 billion. Overall, strong demand supported by a favorable interest rate
environment and an increase in the number of active communities drove increased
order activity and record levels of backlog.

Domestic homebuilding interest expense, which represents
the amortization of capitalized interest, has been reclassified
to home cost of sales.

Gross profit margins from home sales in 2003 increased 120 basis points
over 2002 to 20.6%. Gross profit margins in 2002 increased 30 basis points to
19.4%. Factors that contributed to this favorable trend include strong
customer demand, positive home pricing, the benefits of leverage-buy purchasing
activities and effective production and inventory management. In addition,
2001 gross profit margins were negatively impacted 20 basis points as a result
of purchase accounting adjustments.

Land sales increased in each of the prior three years, demonstrating our
competency in purchasing, developing and entitling certain land positions for
sale primarily to other homebuilders, as well as to retail and commercial
establishments. Revenues and their related gains/losses may vary significantly
between periods, depending on the timing of such sales. We continue to
rationalize certain existing land positions to ensure the most effective use of
invested capital. Included in other assets is approximately $251.2 million in
land held for disposition as of December 31, 2003, as compared to $218.8
million in the prior year.

For the year ended December 31, 2003, selling, general and administrative
expenses, as a percentage of home settlement revenues, increased 20 basis
points to 9.7% after increasing 10 basis points to 9.5% in 2002. The increase
in 2003 is principally attributable to costs associated with the realignment of
our field operations and organizations to meet the challenge and opportunity
for future growth. Higher startup costs for new communities and increased
compensation related costs partially offset by a reduction in costs associated
with the Del Webb operations contributed to the change in 2002.

Other income (expense), net totaled income of $3.4 million in 2003
compared to expense of $23.0 million in 2002. This favorable change was
principally a result of equity earnings from two Nevada-based joint ventures,
totaling $28.5 million, related to the sale of commercial and residential
properties. Other expense, net of $16.9 million in 2001 benefited from income
from certain non-operating investments totaling $4.2 million.

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, our Domestic Homebuilding operations
controlled approximately 256,900 and 176,800 lots, respectively. Approximately
120,400 and 84,300 lots were owned, and approximately 66,000 and 43,800 lots
were under option agreements approved for purchase at December 31, 2003 and

2002, respectively. In addition, there were approximately 70,500 lots under
option agreements at December 31, 2003, pending approval, that are under review
and evaluation for future use by our Domestic Homebuilding operations. This
compared to 48,700 lots at December 31, 2002.

The total purchase price applicable to approved land under option for use
by our homebuilding operations at future dates approximated $2.6 billion at
December 31, 2003. In addition, total purchase price applicable to land under
option pending approval was valued at $2.1 billion at December 31, 2003. Land
option agreements, which may be cancelled at our discretion, may extend over
several years and are secured by deposits totaling $99.0 million, which are
generally non-refundable.



Homebuilding (continued)

International Homebuilding

Our International Homebuilding operations are primarily conducted through
subsidiaries of International in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Argentina. Effective
January 1, 2002, we reorganized the structure of our operations within Mexico
to create a single company, Pulte Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V. , which ranks as
one of the largest builders in the country. Prior to the reorganization, these
operations were conducted primarily through five joint ventures throughout
Mexico. Under the new ownership structure, which combines the largest of these
entities, we own 63.8% of Pulte Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V. and have consolidated
Pulte Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V. into our financial statements. Results for
2002 include joint venture operations for one month and operations as a
consolidated entity for eleven months, as the operations in Mexico report on a
one-month lag.

We are currently in the process of evaluating various long-term strategic
alternatives with regard to our International operations.

Homebuilding operations for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001

Note:

Homebuilding unit settlements of affiliates,
not included in the table above, for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 were 149, 1,022, and
7,258, respectively.

International revenues and unit settlements for 2003 benefited from a full
year of results from our operations in Mexico as well as increased sales in
both Argentina and Puerto Rico. Our Mexico operations had revenues of $172.3
million and unit settlements of 6,777 for the year ended December 31, 2003.
Increased revenues and settlements in 2002 were due to consolidation of the
operations in Mexico for eleven months of 2002, a full year of closings in
Argentina, which recorded its first closing in June of 2001, partially offset
by a decline in Puerto Rico. Our operations in Mexico contributed revenues of
$158.1 million and unit settlements of 6,271 units in 2002.

Gross profit margins from home sales declined 20 basis points to 19.7% in
2003 compared to 2002, as favorable product and geographic mix shifts in Mexico
were offset by less favorable product mix shifts in Puerto Rico and unfavorable
sales pace in Argentina. The consolidation of Mexico had a positive effect on
2002 gross margins, increasing to 19.9% from 12.0% in 2001.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue
increased by 60 basis points to 18.5% in 2003 from 17.9% in 2002. This
increase was driven by additional costs incurred reorganizing our operations in
Mexico in an effort to enhance future profitability. Aggressive marketing
efforts in Argentina, coupled with limited reorganization costs and a stronger
peso, also contributed to the increase.

Our operations in Argentina and Mexico are affected by fluctuations in

currency rates for those countries. Transaction gains and losses for the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, classified as other income (expense),
net, were not significant. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, we
recorded a foreign currency translation gain of $1.9 million and a loss of
$12.8 million, respectively, for Argentina and a translation loss of $5.9
million and a gain of $8.6 million for Mexico, as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income on the balance sheet. At December 31, 2003, our
investment in Argentina and Mexico, net of accumulated foreign currency
translation adjustments, approximated $13.2 million and $65.8 million,
respectively.



Financial Services

We conduct our financial services business, which includes mortgage and
title operations, through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries.

We sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing
sales contracts. Due to the short period of time the servicing rights are
held, generally less than four months, we do not amortize the servicing asset.
Since the servicing rights are recorded based on the value in the servicing
sales contracts, there are no impairment issues related to these assets. We
also originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available
through various credit arrangements, and then sell such mortgage loans to
outside investors.

The following table presents mortgage origination data for our Financial
Services operations:

Mortgage origination unit and principal volume for the year ended December
31, 2003, increased 24% and 32%, respectively, over 2002. This growth can be
attributed to an increase in the capture rate of 510 basis points to 82.7%
combined with the volume increases experienced in our Homebuilding business and
an increase in average loan size. Our capture rate represents loan
originations from our homebuilding business as a percent of total loan
opportunities, excluding cash settlements, from our homebuilding business.
Mortgage origination principal volume in 2002 increased 28% over 2001, due to
an increase in the capture rate of 390 basis points to 77.6% and the inclusion
of Del Webb mortgage operations for a full year. Origination unit volume
increased 21% due to the same factors. Our home buying customers continue to
account for the majority of total loan production representing 83% of total
Pulte Mortgage unit production for 2003, compared with 85% in 2002 and 81% in
2001. Refinancings represented 8% of total loan production in 2003 and 2002,
and 10% during 2001. At December 31, 2003, loan application backlog increased
57% to $2.2 billion as compared to $1.4 billion and $0.8 billion at December
31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2003, increased 3% to $68.8
million, as a result of increased volume, partially offset by the impact of a
less favorable interest rate environment for selling loans during the last six
months of the year and an increase in training, systems, and facilities costs
incurred in anticipation of the projected growth of the business. Gains from
the sale of mortgages increased $2.0 million, or 3%, from the same period in
2002. As compared with 2002, net interest income increased $3.8 million to
$15.1 million during 2003 due to increased production. Income from our title
operations was $13.5 million in 2003, an increase of 11% over 2002.

Pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2002, increased 81% to
$66.7 million, as a result of increased volume, a favorable interest rate
environment, effective leverage of overhead costs and the inclusion of Del Webb
mortgage operations for a full year. Gains from the sale of mortgages
increased $20.4 million, or 49%, from the same period in 2001. As compared
with 2001, net interest income increased $6.3 million to $11.3 million during
2002 due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the
drop in interest rates during 2002. Title income grew 42% contributing $12.2
million to pre-tax income for the year.

We hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed
mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments. For the year ended
December 31, 2003, we did not recognize any net gains or losses related to an
ineffective portion of the hedging instrument. We also did not recognize any
gains or losses during 2003, for cash flow hedges that were discontinued
because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur.
At December 31, 2003, we expect to reclassify $0.2 million, net of taxes, of
net losses on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive
income to earnings during the next twelve months from sales of closed mortgage
loans.



Corporate

Corporate is a non-operating segment that supports the operations of our
subsidiaries by acting as the internal source of financing, developing and
implementing strategic initiatives centered on new business development and
operating efficiencies, and providing the necessary administrative support
associated with being a publicly traded entity listed on the New York Stock
Exchange. As a result, the corporate segment’s operating results will vary
from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve.

The following table presents this segment’s results of operations ($000’s

Interest expense, net of interest capitalized into inventory, increased 3%
to $39.4 million in 2003 and 12% to $38.2 million in 2002. This trend is a
result of an increase in debt levels necessary to support our growth. Interest
incurred for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, excluding
interest incurred by our financial services operations, was approximately
$179.0 million, $162.5 million and $116.9 million, respectively.

Other corporate expense, net in 2003 increased $12.2 million principally
as a result of higher compensation-related costs. Over the two-year period
ended December 31, 2002, other corporate expenses, net were relatively flat, as
higher compensation-related costs were offset by income from the sale and
adjustment to fair value of various non-operating parcels of commercial land
held for sale.

Interest capitalized into inventory is charged to home cost of sales based
on the cyclical timing of our unit settlements, over a period that approximates
the average life cycle of our communities. Interest in inventory, has
increased primarily as a result of higher levels of indebtedness and the

Discontinued Operations

During the third quarter of 2003 and 2002, we recorded non-cash, after-tax
gains of $7.9 million and $10.0 million, respectively, related to the favorable
resolution of certain tax matters relating to our thrift operation, First
Heights Bank, fsb (First Heights), which we discontinued in 1994.

In September 2003, the United States Court of Federal Claims issued final
judgment that Pulte Homes, Inc., Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc. and First
Heights (collectively, the Pulte Parties) had been damaged by approximately
$48.7 million as a result of the United States government’s breach of contract
with them. The final judgment follows the Court’s August 17, 2001 ruling that
the United States breached the contract related to the Pulte Parties’ 1988
acquisition of five savings and loan associations by enacting Section 13224 of
the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. The United States government and
the Pulte Parties filed Notices of Appeal with the United States Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit in October 2003. Accordingly, any gain related
to this litigation will be recognized only upon final resolution.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31,
2003 totaled $301.8 million. The increase in net income was offset by
significant investments in land necessary to support the continued growth of
the business. Net cash used in investing activities was $34.1 million for
2003. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December
31, 2003, was $128.9 million, reflecting proceeds from the $300 million senior
notes issued in February and the $400 million senior notes issued in May and
proceeds from employee stock option exercises, offset by the repayment of debt,
dividends paid and stock repurchases.

Our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December
31, 2002, was $148.8 million. The increase in net income was aided by the
realization of certain tax benefits and an increase in accrued liabilities,
while inventories continued to build to support the growth of the business.
Net cash provided by investing activities was $21.5 million for 2002. Net cash
provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, was
$374.0 million, reflecting proceeds from the $300 million senior notes issued
in June 2002, proceeds from borrowings under our various credit facilities and
proceeds from employee stock option exercises, offset by the repayment of debt,
dividends paid and stock repurchases.

We finance our homebuilding land acquisitions, development and
construction activities from internally generated funds and existing credit
agreements. Effective October 1, 2003, we replaced our $570 million
revolving credit facility with an $850 million facility that includes the
capacity to issue letters of credit up to $500 million. This new credit
facility expires October 1, 2008. We had no borrowings under our unsecured
revolving credit facility at December 31, 2003.

Pulte Mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and
uses its own funds and borrowings made available pursuant to various committed
and uncommitted credit arrangements. Pulte Mortgage has committed credit
arrangements of $860 million comprised of a $310 million bank revolving credit
facility and a $550 million annual asset-backed commercial paper program.
There were approximately $479.3 million of borrowings outstanding under
existing Pulte Mortgage arrangements at December 31, 2003. Mortgage loans
originated by Pulte Mortgage are subsequently sold to outside investors. We
anticipate that there will be adequate mortgage financing available for
purchasers of our homes.

In February 2003, we sold $300 million of 6.25% unsecured senior notes,
due 2013. Proceeds from this issuance were used to retire our $175 million
9.5% senior notes that matured on April 1, 2003 and redeem the remaining
outstanding principal balance of approximately $155 million of Del Webb’s $200
million 9.375% senior subordinated notes due 2009 that were called for
redemption in March at a price equal to 104.688% of the principal amount.

In May 2003, we sold $400 million of 6.375% unsecured senior notes, due
2033. Proceeds from this issuance were used for general corporate purposes and
to retire our $100 million 7% senior notes that matured on December 15, 2003.

In December 2003, we increased our dividend 150% to $.05 per share from
$.02 per share.

Pursuant to our $100 million share repurchase program, we repurchased
790,800 common shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $18.2 million
during 2003 and 200,000 common shares for approximately $4.3 million in 2002.
At December 31, 2003, we had remaining authorization to purchase common stock
aggregating $77.5 million.

Our income tax liability and related effective tax rate are affected by a
number of factors. In 2003, our effective tax rate was 38.0% compared to 39.0%
in 2002 and 38.5% in 2001. The reduction in the effective tax rate for 2003 is
principally due to a lower expected effective state income tax rate for 2003
and the shareholders’ approval of our new Senior Management Annual Incentive
Plan, which will allow for full tax deductibility of Plan payments under
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Service Code. We anticipate that our
effective tax rate for 2004 will be approximately 38%.

At December 31, 2003, we had cash and equivalents of $404.1 million, $2.1
billion of unsecured senior notes and $77.3 million of unsecured senior
subordinated notes. Other financing includes limited recourse collateralized
financing totaling $83.3 million.

Sources of our working capital at December 31, 2003, include cash and
equivalents, our $850 million committed unsecured revolving credit facility and
Pulte Mortgage’s $860 million revolving credit facilities. Our debt-to-total
capitalization, excluding our collateralized debt, was 38.4% as of December 31,
2003, and 33.6% net of cash and equivalents. We expect to maintain our net
debt-to-total capitalization at or below the 40% level.

In January 2004, we sold $500 million of 5.25% senior notes, due 2014.
Proceeds from the sale will be used to retire the Del Webb 10.25% subordinated
debentures called for redemption and for general corporate purposes including
continued investment in our business.



Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)

Inflation

We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected
during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs.
Inflation also increases our financing, labor and material costs. In
addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability
of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass
to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. To
date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of
operations. However, there is no assurance that inflation will not have a
material adverse impact on our future results of operations.

revolving credit facilities.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We use standby letters of credit and performance bonds to guarantee our
performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the
development of our projects. The expiration dates of the letter of credit
contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related projects.
If the obligations related to a project are ongoing, annual extensions of the
letters of credit are typically granted on a year-to-year basis. At December
31, 2003, we had outstanding letters of credit of $215.2 million. Performance
bonds do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the
bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds, which
approximated $1.2 billion at December 31, 2003, are typically outstanding over
a period that approximates 3-5 years. We do not believe that we will be
required to draw upon any such letters of credit or performance bonds.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements (continued)

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land option or option
type agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the
future. At December 31, 2003, these agreements totaled approximately $4.7
billion. Pursuant to these land option agreements, we provide a deposit to the
seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in
the future, usually at predetermined prices. If the entity holding the land
under option is a variable interest entity, our deposit represents a variable
interest in that entity. At December 31, 2003, we consolidated certain
variable interest entities with assets totaling $73.3 million.

We currently do not have any non-consolidated special purpose entity
arrangements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
When more than one accounting principle, or the method of its application, is
generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is appropriate in
our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make
estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result,
actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial
statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and
disclosures included in the financial statements, giving due regard to
materiality. The development and selection of the following critical
accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee
of the Board of Directors.

Revenue recognition

Homebuilding

– Homebuilding revenues are recorded when the sales of homes
are completed and ownership has transferred to the customer. Unfunded
settlements are deposits in transit on homes for which the sale was completed.
We do not engage in arrangements whereby we have ongoing relationships with our
homebuyers that require us to repurchase our homes or provide homebuyers with
the right of return.

Financial
Services

– Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for
servicing loans for various investors. Servicing fees are based on a
contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance and are credited to
income when the related mortgage payments are received. Loan origination fees,
commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred as an
adjustment to the cost of the related mortgage loan until such loan is sold.
Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are
sold. Interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated
until the loan is sold.

Inventory valuation

Our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated costs or
net realizable value. Included in inventories are all direct development
costs. Inventories under development or held for development are stated at
accumulated cost, unless they are determined to be impaired, in which case
these inventories are measured at fair value. If actual market conditions are
less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory
adjustments may be required.

We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories. Interest
capitalized each quarter is identified as a separate layer in our capitalized
interest balance sheet pool. Each layer of capitalized interest is amortized
over a period that approximates the average life of communities under
development. Interest expense is allocated to the quarters over the
amortization period based on the historical relationship of unit settlements in
a quarter compared to annual unit settlements. This period increased in 2001,
due to the addition of the Del Webb properties, which have a longer life cycle,
and could change in the future as the mix of communities change.

Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis. Under the
specific identification basis, cost of sales includes the construction cost of
the home, an average lot cost by project based on land acquisition and
development costs, and closing costs and commissions. Construction cost of the
home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home, plus an
accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted
construction cost. This accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual
payments made after closing compared to the amount accrued, and adjustments are
made if needed. Total project land acquisition and development costs are based
on an analysis of budgeted costs compared to actual costs incurred to date and
estimates to complete. Adjustments to estimated total project land acquisition
and development costs for the project affect the amount of future lots costed.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)

Residential mortgage loans available-for-sale

Residential mortgage loans available-for-sale are stated at the lower of
aggregate cost or market value. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans
are recognized when the loans are sold. We hedge our residential mortgage
loans available-for-sale. Gains and losses from closed commitments and futures
contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on the sale of
mortgage loans.

Goodwill and intangible assets

We have identified significant intangible assets and generated significant
goodwill, most recently as a result of the Del Webb merger in 2001. Intangible
assets, primarily trademarks and tradenames, were valued using proven valuation
procedures and are amortized over their estimated useful life. Goodwill is
subject to annual impairment testing. The carrying value and ultimate
realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and
benefits that we expect to generate from their use. If our expectations of
future results and cash flows decrease significantly, intangible assets and
goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be
material. If we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets,
long-lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence
of one or more indicators of impairment, we measure impairment based on one of
three methods. For assets related to ongoing operations, we use a projected
undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists and then
measure impairment using discounted cash flows. For assets to be disposed of,
we assess the fair value of the asset based on current market conditions for
similar assets. For goodwill, we assess fair value by measuring discounted
cash flows of our reporting units and measure impairment as the difference
between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book
value.

The estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make
significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors
outside of our control. Changes in these estimates could result in significant
revisions to the carrying value of these assets and material charges to the
results of operations.

Allowance for warranties

Home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building
defects. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary
geographically. Most warranties cover different aspects of the home’s
construction and operating systems for a period of up to ten years. We
estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability
in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors
that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold, historical
and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. We periodically
assess the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as
necessary. Although we have not made significant adjustments to the accrual in
the past, actual warranty cost in the future could differ from our current
estimate.

Stock-based compensation

We currently have several stock-based employee compensation plans.
Effective January 1, 2003 we adopted the preferable fair value recognition
provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” We
selected the prospective method of adoption as permitted by SFAS No. 148,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure.” Under
the prospective method, we will recognize compensation expense based on the
fair value provisions of SFAS No. 123 for all new stock option grants effective
January 1, 2003. Grants made prior to January 1, 2003 will continue to be
accounted for under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related
Interpretations. With the exception of certain variable stock option grants,
no stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income for grants
made prior to January 1, 2003, as all options granted under those plans had an
exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the
date of the grant.

We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value
of each option grant. The Black-Scholes model includes assumptions regarding
dividend yields, expected volatility, risk-free interest rates and expected
lives. These assumptions reflect management’s best estimates, but these items
involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of
our control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, stock-based
compensation expense could have been materially impacted. Furthermore, if
management uses different assumptions in future periods, stock-based
compensation expense could be materially impacted in future periods.



ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are subject to interest rate risk on our rate-sensitive financing to
the extent long-term rates decline. The following tables set forth, as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, our rate-sensitive financing obligations, principal

Pulte Mortgage, operating as a mortgage banker, is also subject to
interest rate risk. Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to
a customer at agreed-upon terms (i.e., commit to lend at a certain interest
rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk continues through
the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2003 and
2002, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In
periods of rising interest rates, the length of exposure will generally
increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to
letting the interest rate float.

We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable
rate borrowing agreement tied to the Federal Funds rate and (ii) hedging our
loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments.
These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on
mortgage-backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on
treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on
mortgage-backed securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments
for trading purposes.

Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments
arising from immediate parallel shifts in long-term mortgage rates of plus 50,
100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results.

Our aggregate net investments exposed to foreign currency exchange rate
risk include our operations in Mexico which approximated $65.8 million, our
mortgage banking joint venture investment in Mexico which approximated $17.5
million and our operations in Argentina which approximated $13.2 million.

Basis of presentation and significant accounting policies

Basis of presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pulte
Homes, Inc. and all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (the Company).
The direct subsidiaries of Pulte Homes, Inc. include Pulte Diversified
Companies, Inc., Del Webb Corporation (Del Webb) and other subsidiaries that
are engaged in the homebuilding business. Pulte Diversified Companies,
Inc.’s operating subsidiaries include Pulte Home Corporation, Pulte
International Corporation (International) and other subsidiaries that are
engaged in the homebuilding business. Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc.’s
non-operating thrift subsidiary, First Heights Bank, fsb (First Heights), is
classified as a discontinued operation (See Note 4). The Company also has a
mortgage banking company, Pulte Mortgage LLC (Pulte Mortgage), which is a
subsidiary of Pulte Home Corporation.

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company reorganized the structure of its
operations within Mexico to create a single company, Pulte Mexico S. de R.L.
de C.V. Under the new ownership structure, the Company’s operations in
Mexico, which were primarily conducted through joint ventures, have been
combined into Pulte Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V. and are 63.8% owned by
International. Results for 2002 include joint venture operations for one
month and operations as a consolidated entity for eleven months, as the
operations in Mexico report on a one-month lag.

Certain amounts previously reported in the 2002 financial statements
and notes thereto were reclassified to conform to the 2003 presentation. In
addition, all share and per share amounts have been restated to reflect the
Company’s two-for-one stock split announced December 11, 2003 and effected
January 2, 2004.

Significant accounting policies

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Foreign currency

The financial statements of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries in
Argentina and Mexico are measured using the local currency as the functional
currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at
exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are
translated at average exchange rates in effect during the year. The
resulting cumulative translation adjustments have been recorded in other
comprehensive income. Realized foreign currency transaction gains and
losses are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Realized
foreign currency transaction losses were $0.4 million, $0.7 million, and
$0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

Cash and equivalents

For purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, commercial
paper and time deposits with a maturity of three months or less when
acquired are classified as cash equivalents.

Goodwill

On January 1, 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” became effective.
In accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company does not record amortization
expense related to goodwill but reviews it annually for impairment. The
following table sets forth reported net income and earnings per share, as
adjusted to exclude goodwill amortization:

At December 31, 2003, the majority of goodwill, which represents the
cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of the net assets at
the acquisition date, resulted from the acquisition of Del Webb in 2001.
All goodwill relates to the Homebuilding segment, except for $0.7 million
which relates to the Financial Services segment. In accordance with SFAS
No. 142, annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying amount may not be recoverable, management evaluates the
recoverability of goodwill by comparing the carrying value of the Company’s
reporting units to their fair value. Fair value is determined based on
discounted future cash flows. The Company performed its annual impairment
test during the fourth quarter 2003 and determined there to be no impairment
of goodwill. There has been no change in the carrying amount of goodwill
for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002.

Intangible assets

Intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks and tradenames
acquired in connection with the 2001 acquisition of Del Webb. These
intangible assets were valued at the acquisition date utilizing proven
valuation procedures and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a
20-year life. The acquired cost and accumulated amortization of the
Company’s intangible assets is $163.5 million and $19.8 million,
respectively, at December 31, 2003. Amortization expense for the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 was $8.3 million, $8.2 million, and
$3.4 million, respectively, and is expected to be approximately $8.3 million
in each of the next 5 years.

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, intangible assets are reviewed for
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators exist, an
assessment of undiscounted future cash flows for the assets related to these
intangibles is evaluated accordingly. If the results of the analysis
indicate impairment, the assets are adjusted to fair market value.

Fixed Assets and Depreciation

Fixed assets are recorded at cost. Maintenance and repair costs are
charged to earnings as incurred. Depreciation is computed principally by
the straight-line method based upon estimated useful lives as follows:
Vehicles, three to five years, model and office furniture, two to five
years, and equipment, three to ten years. Fixed assets are included in
Other Assets and totaled $92.4 million net of accumulated depreciation of
$88.8 million at December 31, 2003 and $76.1 million net of $74.3 million at
December 31, 2002. Total depreciation expense for the years ended December
31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $31.9 million, $31.1 million, and $30.1 million,
respectively.

Investments in unconsolidated entities

The Company participates in a number of joint ventures with independent
third parties in which the Company has less than a controlling interest.
These joint ventures purchase, develop and/or sell land and homes in the
United States, Mexico and Puerto Rico. The Company recognizes its share of
profits from the sale of lots and homes to other buyers. Profits from lots
the Company purchases from the joint ventures are not recognized, but
instead are deferred until which time the related homes are sold. At
December 31, 2003, the Company had approximately $51.9 million invested in
these joint ventures. In the event management of the joint ventures
determines that an additional capital infusion is required, the Company
would need to contribute its pro rata portion of those capital needs in
order not to dilute its ownership in the joint venture. The Company has not
guaranteed any of the outstanding debt of the joint ventures at December 31,
2003, which approximated $121.4 million.

The Company also owns 22.2% of the capital stock of a mortgage banking
company in Mexico. At December 31, 2003, the Company’s investment in this
entity was approximately $17.5 million. The Company does not have any
purchase or investment commitments to this entity. Furthermore, the Company
has not guaranteed any of the indebtedness of this entity, which
approximated $1.3 billion at December 31, 2003.

These investments are accounted for under the equity method.

Advertising cost

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. For the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company incurred advertising
costs of approximately $80.6 million, $78.2 million and $56.8 million,
respectively.

Employee benefits

The Company maintains three defined contribution plans that cover
substantially all of the Company’s employees. Company contributions to the
plans are expensed as paid. The total Company contributions pursuant to the
plans were approximately $9.5 million, $7.0 million and $3.8 million for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to
common shareholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of common
shares, adjusted for nonvested shares of restricted stock (the denominator)
for the period. Computing diluted earnings per share is similar to basic
earnings per share, except that the denominator is increased to include the
dilutive effects of options and restricted stock grants. Any options that
have an exercise price greater than the average market price are excluded
from the diluted earnings per share calculation. For the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, 78,316, 267,272 and 1,795,500,
respectively, of the outstanding stock options were excluded from this
calculation.

Fair values of financial instruments

Carrying amounts for financial derivative instruments reported in the
balance sheet approximate fair value as the amounts reported are based on
current market prices. The estimated fair values of financial instruments
were determined by management using available market information and
appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is necessary to
interpret the market data and develop the estimated fair value.
Accordingly, the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the
amounts the Company could realize on disposition of the financial
instruments. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation
methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value
amounts.

The carrying amounts of cash and equivalents approximate their fair
values due to their short-term nature.

The fair value of residential mortgage loans available-for-sale is
estimated using the quoted market prices for securities backed by similar
loans. Fair value exceeded cost by approximately $6.3 million and $7.8
million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for derivative
instruments approximate fair value as the amounts reported are based on
current market prices. At December 31, 2003, derivative assets, included
in other assets, in the balance sheet, totaled $2.7 million and derivative
liabilities, included in accrued and other liabilities, totaled $3.9
million.

The fair values of subordinated debentures and senior notes are based
on quoted market prices, when available. If quoted market prices are not
available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of similar issues.

Disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments are based on
pertinent information available to management as of December 31, 2003.
Although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly
affect the reasonableness of the fair value amounts, such amounts were not
comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since
that date and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from
the amounts presented herein.

Stock-based compensation

The Company currently has several stock-based employee compensation
plans. Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the preferable fair
value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees.” The Company selected the prospective method of adoption as
permitted by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation –
Transition and Disclosure.” Under the prospective method, the Company will
recognize compensation expense based on the fair value provisions of SFAS
No. 123 for all new stock option grants effective January 1, 2003. Grants
made prior to January 1, 2003 will continue to be accounted for under the
recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related Interpretations. With the
exception of certain variable stock option grants, no stock-based employee
compensation cost is reflected in net income for grants made prior to
January 1, 2003, as all options granted in those years had an exercise price
equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of
grant.

Stock-based compensation (continued)

The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings
per share if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions
of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” to all
stock-based employee compensation. The fair value of each option grant is
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model
with the following weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively: weighted-average dividend yields of .44%, .32%
and .39%, expected volatility of 35.3%, 34.9% and 34.8%, weighted-average
risk-free interest rates of 3.57%, 3.45% and 4.94%, and weighted-average
expected lives of 6.76 years, 6.82 years and 6.97 years.

The company also recorded compensation expense for restricted stock
awards, net of related tax effects, of $9.9 million, $3.2 million, and $1.1
million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
These amounts have been excluded from the reconciliation above as they would
have no impact on pro forma net income as presented.

New accounting pronouncements

In November of 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45,
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees,
Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others”, an interpretation
of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and rescission of FASB Interpretation
No. 34. This interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a
guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its
obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies
that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee,
a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the
guarantee. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are
applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after
December 31, 2002 and the disclosure provisions were effective for the year
ended December 31, 2002. The adoption of this interpretation did not have a
material effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations,
financial condition, or cash flows.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.”
This statement establishes standards for the classification and measurement
of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities
and equity. With the exception of certain measurement criteria deferred
indefinitely by the FASB, SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial
instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and otherwise is
effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June
15, 2003. The implementation of SFAS No. 150 is not expected to have a
material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition,
or cash flows.

Land, not owned, under option agreements

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46),
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.” Until this interpretation was
issued, a company generally included another entity in its consolidated
financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting
interests. FIN 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by
a company if that company is subject to a majority of the expected losses
from the variable interest entity’s activities or is entitled to receive a
majority of the entity’s expected residual returns. FIN 46 applied
immediately to all variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003
and is effective no later than the first interim period ending after
December 31, 2003 for variable interest entities created prior to February
1, 2003.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into land option
agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the
future. Pursuant to these land option agreements, the Company will provide
a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at
different times in the future, usually at predetermined prices. Under FIN
46, if the entity holding the land under option is a variable interest
entity, the Company’s deposit represents a variable interest in that entity.
The Company does not guarantee the obligations or performance of the
variable interest entity.

In applying the provisions of FIN 46, the Company evaluated all
post-January 31, 2003 land option agreements and determined that the Company
was subject to a majority of the expected losses or entitled to receive a
majority of the expected residual returns under a limited number of these
agreements. As the primary beneficiary under these agreements, the Company
is required to consolidate the fair value of the variable interest entity.
At December 31, 2003, the Company classified $73.3 million as Land, Not
Owned, Under Option Agreements on the balance sheet, representing the fair
value of land under contract including deposits. The corresponding
liability has been classified as Accounts Payable, Accrued and Other
Liabilities on the balance sheet. The adoption of FIN 46 has had no impact
on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows.

The Company is in the process of evaluating its land option agreements
and other agreements entered into prior to February 1, 2003. Depending on
the terms and conditions of these agreements, the Company may be required to
consolidate other variable interest entities. This evaluation will be
completed by March 31, 2004.

Land held for sale

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had approximately $251.2
million and $226.1 million of land held for sale classified as other assets
in the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the Company’s Homebuilding
segment. Land held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value
less costs to sell.

Allowance for warranties

Home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building
defects. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary
geographically. Most warranties cover different aspects of the home’s
construction and operating systems for a period of up to ten years. The
Company estimates the costs to be incurred under these warranties and
records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue
is recognized. Factors that affect the Company’s warranty liability include
the number of homes sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty
claims, and cost per claim. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy
of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.

Changes to the Company’s allowance for warranties for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, are as follows ($000’s omitted):

Revenues

Homebuilding revenues are recorded when the sales of homes are

settlements are deposits in transit on homes for which the sale was
completed.

Start-up costs

Costs and expenses associated with entry into new homebuilding markets
and opening new communities in existing markets are expensed when incurred.

Financial Services

Mortgage servicing rights

The Company allocates the cost of mortgage loans originated and
purchased between the mortgage loans and the right to service those mortgage
loans, based on relative fair value, on the date the loan is sold.

The Company sells its servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed
price servicing sales contracts. Due to the short period of time the
servicing rights are held, generally less than four months, the Company does
not amortize the servicing asset. Furthermore, there are no impairment
issues since the servicing rights are recorded based on the value in the
servicing sales contracts. The servicing sales contracts provide for the
reimbursement of payments made when loans prepay within specified periods of
time, usually 90 days after sale or securitization. The Company establishes
reserves for this liability, included in accrued and other liabilities, at
the time the sale is recorded. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, total servicing
rights recognized were $36.7 million, $35.7 million, and $36.2 million,
respectively, which are reflected in net gains from the sale of mortgages.

Residential mortgage loans available-for-sale

Residential mortgage loans available-for-sale are stated at the lower
of aggregate cost or market value. Unamortized net mortgage discounts
totaled $1.6 million and $1.5 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. These discounts are not amortized as interest revenue during
the period the loans are held for sale.

Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the
loans are sold. The Company hedges its residential mortgage loans
available-for-sale. Gains and losses from closed commitments and futures
contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on the sale of
mortgage loans. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, net gains from the sale of
mortgages were $64.4 million, $62.4 million and $41.9 million, respectively,
which have been included in Financial Services revenue.

Interest income on mortgage loans

Interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated
until the loan is sold.

Mortgage servicing, origination and commitment fees

Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for
various investors. Servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of
the outstanding principal balance and are credited to income when related
mortgage payments are received. Loan origination fees, commitment fees and
certain direct loan origination costs are deferred as an adjustment to the
cost of the related mortgage loan until such loan is sold.

Derivative instruments and hedging activities

The Company recognizes all of its derivative instruments as either
assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting
for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative
instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part
of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship.
For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging
instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument, based upon the
exposure being hedged, as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair
value hedge (i.e., hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an
asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable
to a particular risk), the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well
as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged
risk are recognized in current earnings during the period of the change in
fair values. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as
a cash flow hedge (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected
future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk), the effective
portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a
component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in
the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects
earnings. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments,
the gain or loss is recognized in current earnings during the period of
change. The Company currently uses only cash flow hedges.

Market risks arise from movements in interest rates and cancelled or
modified commitments to lend. In order to reduce these risks, the Company
uses derivative financial instruments. These financial instruments include
cash forward placement contracts on mortgage-backed securities, whole loan
investor commitments, options on treasury futures contracts, and options on
cash forward placement contracts on mortgage-backed securities. The Company
does not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
When the Company commits to lend to the borrower (interest rate is locked to
the borrower), the Company enters into one of the aforementioned derivative
financial instruments. The change in the value of the loan commitment and
the derivative financial instrument is recognized in current earnings during
the period of change. At December 31, 2003, commitments by Pulte Mortgage
to originate mortgage loans totaled $201.5 million at interest rates
prevailing at the date of commitment.

Basis of presentation and significant accounting policies (continued)

Significant accounting policies (continued)

Financial Services (continued)

Derivative instruments and hedging activities (continued)

Cash forward placement contracts on mortgage-back securities are
commitments to either purchase or sell a specified financial instrument at a
specified future date for a specified price and may be settled in cash by
offsetting the position, or through the delivery of the financial
instrument. Options on treasury futures contracts and options on
mortgage-backed securities grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the
right to either purchase or sell a specified treasury futures contract or a
specified mortgage-backed security, respectively, for a specified price
within a specified period of time or on a specified date from or to the
writer of the option.

Mandatory cash forward contracts on mortgage-backed securities are the
predominant derivative financial instruments used to minimize the market
risk during the period from when the Company extends an interest rate lock
to a loan applicant until the time the loan is sold to an investor. Whole
loan investor commitments are obligations of the investor to buy loans at a
specified price within a specified time period. At December 31, 2003, Pulte
Mortgage had unexpired cash forward contracts and whole loan investor
commitments of $668.8 million. Options on cash forward contracts on
mortgage-backed securities are used in the same manner as mandatory cash
forward contracts, but provide protection from interest rates rising, while
still allowing an opportunity for profit if interest rates fall. Options on
the treasury futures contracts are used as cross hedges on various loan
product types and to protect the Company in a volatile interest rate
environment from unexpected increases, cancellations or modifications in
lending commitments.

Since the Company can terminate a loan commitment if the borrower does
not comply with the terms of the contract, and some loan commitments may
expire without being drawn upon, these commitments do not necessarily
represent future cash requirements of Pulte Mortgage. The Company evaluates
the creditworthiness of these transactions through its normal credit
policies.

The Company hedges portions of its forecasted cash flow from sales of
closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments. During the
year ended December 31, 2003, the Company did not recognize any net gains or
losses related to an ineffective portion of the hedging instrument. In
addition, the Company did not recognize any net gains or losses during the
year ended December 31, 2003, for cash flow hedges that were discontinued
because the forecasted transaction did not occur. At December 31, 2003, the
Company expects to reclassify $0.2 million net of taxes, of net losses on
derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to
earnings during the next twelve months from sales of closed mortgage loans.

Del Webb merger

On July 31, 2001, the Company merged with Del Webb Corporation in a
tax-free stock-for-stock transaction. Under the terms of the merger
agreement, each outstanding share of Del Webb common stock was exchanged for
approximately 0.894 shares of newly issued Company stock. Approximately
16.8 million shares were issued to Del Webb shareholders. Del Webb was
primarily a homebuilder with operations in seven states. For the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2001, Del Webb reported net income of $91.2 million on
revenues of $1.9 billion and 7,038 unit settlements. Backlog reported at
June 30, 2001, was 3,682 units valued at approximately $994 million.

This merger expanded and supported the Company’s leadership position.
In particular, the Company believes the merger strengthened its position
among active adult homebuyers, added important strategic land positions,
provided operational savings from economies of scale, bolstered purchasing
leverage, and enhanced overall competitive position.

The merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
Approximately 16.8 million shares were issued and assigned an approximate
accounting value of $42.74 per share based on the average closing price of
the Company’s stock for the five trading days ended July 26, 2001. The

Discontinued operations

In September 1988, substantially all of the assets, business operations
and certain liabilities of five Texas-based insolvent thrifts were acquired
by First Heights. Assistance with each acquisition was provided by the
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) pursuant to an
Assistant Agreement.

During the first quarter of 1994, the Company adopted a plan of
disposal for First Heights and announced its strategy to exit the thrift
industry and increase its focus on housing and related mortgage banking.
First Heights sold all but one of its 32 bank branches and related deposits
to two unrelated purchasers. The sale was substantially completed during
the fourth quarter of 1994, although the Company held brokered deposits
which were not liquidated until 1998.

Although the Company in 1994, expected to complete the plan of disposal
within a reasonable period of time, contractual disputes with the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) precluded the Company from completing
the disposal in accordance with its original plan. As discussed in Note 11,
the Company settled its litigation with the FDIC in October 2001.

First Heights’ day-to-day activities have been principally devoted to
supporting residual regulatory compliance matters and the litigation with
the United States government, discussed in Note 11, and are not reflective
of the active operations of the former thrift, such as maintaining
traditional transaction accounts (e.g., checking and savings accounts) or
making loans. Accordingly, such operations are being presented as
discontinued.

Revenues of discontinued operations were $6,000, $17,000 and $29,000
for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. For the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, discontinued thrift operations
reported after-tax gains of $7.3 million and $9.0 million and an after-tax
loss of $1.0 million, respectively. The after-tax gains for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002 include approximately $7.9 million and $10.0

Other financing arrangements

Corporate/Homebuilding

Effective October 1, 2003, Pulte Homes, Inc. replaced its $570 million
revolving credit facility with an $850 million facility that includes the
capacity to issue letters of credit up to $500 million. Borrowing
availability on this line is reduced by the amount of letters of credit
outstanding. This new credit facility expires October 1, 2008. The bank
credit agreement contains restrictive covenants, the most restrictive of
which requires the Company not to exceed a debt-to-total capitalization
ratio as defined in the agreement of 50%. The following is a summary of
aggregate borrowing information related to this facility ($000’s omitted):

In addition, the Company’s operating entity in Argentina entered into a
$3 million revolving credit facility in October 2002 to provide an
additional financial resource to support the operations. Pulte Homes, Inc.
has guaranteed the credit facility. There was $2 million outstanding under
this facility at December 31, 2003.

At December 31, 2003, other financing included limited recourse
collateralized financing arrangements totaling $83.3 million. These
financing arrangements have maturities ranging primarily from one to four
years, a weighted average interest rate of 4.31%, are generally
collateralized by certain land positions and have no recourse to any other
assets. These arrangements have been classified as accrued and other
liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Financial Services

Notes payable to banks (collateralized short-term debt) are secured by
residential mortgage loans available-for-sale. The carrying amounts of such
borrowings approximate fair value.

During 2003, Pulte Mortgage replaced and expanded its $175 million
revolving credit facility with a $310 million facility and replaced its $325
million asset-backed commercial paper program with a $550 million program.
The revolving credit facility expires in March 2005 and the asset-backed
commercial paper program can be extended to August 2005. During the three
years ended December 31, 2003, Pulte Mortgage provided compensating
balances, in the form of escrows and other custodial funds, in order to
further reduce interest rates. The bank credit agreements contain
restrictive covenants, the most restrictive of which requires Pulte Mortgage
to maintain a minimum tangible net worth of $30 million.

Income taxes

The Company’s net deferred tax asset (liability) is as follows ($000’s omitted):

The state net operating losses of $62.7 million expire in years 2013
through 2023. International net operating losses of $48,007 will expire in
years 2006 through 2013. Net operating losses are generally available to
offset the Company’s taxable income in future years. State and other credit
carryforwards include a state credit voucher of $10.8 million that is
expected to be realized by the Company no later than 2006. Realization of
the net deferred tax asset, in certain jurisdictions, is dependent on future
reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and adequate future
taxable income. Although realization is not assured, management believes
that, except for the valuation allowance stated, it is more likely than not
that the net deferred tax asset will be realized.

Leases

The Company leases certain property and equipment under non-cancelable
leases. Office and equipment leases are generally for terms of three to five
years and generally provide renewal options for terms of up to an additional
three years. Model home leases are generally for shorter terms approximating
one year with renewal options on a month-to-month basis. In most cases,

Commitments and contingencies

In the normal course of business, the Company acquires rights under
options or option-type agreements to purchase land to be used in homebuilding
operations at future dates. The total purchase price applicable to land
under option that has been approved for purchase approximated $2.6 billion
and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The total
purchase price applicable to land under option that has not been approved for
purchase approximated $2.1 billion and $982 million at December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively.

At December 31, 2003, the Company, in the normal course of business, had
outstanding letters of credit and performance bonds of $1.4 billion.

The Company could be required to repurchase loans sold to investors that
have not been underwritten in accordance with the investor guidelines
(defective loans). The Company, in the normal course of business,
indemnifies investors for defective loans that they have purchased. As of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had been notified of $8.6 million and
$8.8 million of defective loans, respectively. The Company assesses the risk
of loss on these indemnifications and establishes reserves for them. At
December 31, 2003 and 2002, reserves for indemnification on defective loans
are reflected in accrued and other liabilities and amounted to $0.3 million.

The Company is involved in various litigation incidental to its
continuing business operations. Management does not believe that this
litigation will have a material adverse impact on the results of operations,
financial position or cash flows of the Company.

First Heights-related litigation

Pulte Homes, Inc. was a party to three lawsuits relating to First
Heights’ 1988 acquisition from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corporation (FSLIC) and First Heights’ ownership of five failed Texas
thrifts. The first lawsuit (the District Court Case) was filed on July 7,
1995, in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Michigan, by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) against Pulte Homes, Inc.,
Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc. and First Heights (collectively, the Pulte
Parties). The second lawsuit (the Court of Federal Claims Case) was filed on
December 26, 1996, in the United States Court of Federal Claims (Washington,
D.C.) by the Pulte Parties against the United States. The third lawsuit was
filed by First Heights on January 10, 2000, in the United States District
Court, Eastern District of Michigan against the FDIC regarding the amounts,
including interest, the FDIC was obligated to pay First Heights on two
promissory notes which had been executed by the FDIC’s predecessor, the
FSLIC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Commitments and contingencies (continued)

First Heights-related litigation (continued)

In the District Court Case, the FDIC, as successor to the FSLIC, sought
a declaration of rights and other relief related to the Assistance Agreement
entered into between First Heights and the FSLIC. The FDIC and the Pulte
Parties disagreed about the proper interpretation of provisions in the
Assistance Agreement which provide for sharing of certain tax benefits
achieved in connection with First Heights’ 1988 acquisition and ownership of
the five failed Texas thrifts. The District Court Case also included certain
other claims relating to the foregoing, including claims resulting from the
Company’s and First Heights’ amendment of a tax sharing and allocation
agreement between the Company and First Heights. The Pulte Parties disputed
the FDIC’s claims and filed an answer and a counterclaim seeking, among other
things, a declaration that the FDIC had breached the Assistance Agreement in
numerous respects. On December 24, 1996, the Pulte Parties voluntarily
dismissed without prejudice certain of their claims in the District Court
Case and, on December 26, 1996, initiated the Court of Federal Claims Case.

In October 2001, the FDIC and the Pulte Parties settled the District
Court Case, the related appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and the
third lawsuit. As part of this settlement (the Settlement), the First
Heights Assistance Agreement was terminated, except that certain tax benefit
sharing provisions will continue in effect, and the warrants issued by First
Heights to the FDIC were extinguished. The Company does not believe that the
claims in the Court of Federal Claims Case are in any way prejudiced by the
Settlement.

In the Court of Federal Claims Case, the Pulte Parties assert breaches
of contract on the part of the United States in connection with the enactment
of Section 13224 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA).
That provision repealed portions of the tax benefits that the Pulte Parties
claim they were entitled to under the contract to acquire the failed Texas
thrifts. The Pulte Parties also assert other claims concerning the contract,
including that the United States (through the FDIC as receiver) improperly
attempted to amend the failed thrifts’ pre-acquisition tax returns and that
this attempt was made in an effort to deprive the Pulte Parties of tax
benefits for which they had contracted.

On August 17, 2001, the United States Court of Federal Claims ruled that
the United States government is liable to the Pulte Parties for breach of
contract by enacting Section 13224 of OBRA. In September 2003, the United
States Court of Federal Claims issued final judgment that the Pulte Parties
had been damaged by approximately $48.7 million as a result of the United
States government’s breach of contract with them. The United States
government and the Pulte Parties filed Notices of Appeal with the United
States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in October 2003.
Accordingly, any gain related to this litigation will be recognized only upon
final resolution.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Pulte Homes, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pulte Homes,
Inc. as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2003. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Pulte
Homes, Inc. at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
changed in 2003 its method of accounting for stock options and in 2002 its
method of accounting for goodwill.
