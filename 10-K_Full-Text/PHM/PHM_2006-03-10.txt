ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Pulte Homes, Inc.

Pulte Homes, Inc. is a publicly held holding company whose subsidiaries engage in the
homebuilding and financial services businesses. Pulte Homes, Inc. is a Michigan corporation and
was organized in 1956. Our assets consist principally of the capital stock of our subsidiaries and
our income primarily consists of dividends from our subsidiaries. Our direct subsidiaries include
Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc., Del Webb Corporation (“Del Webb”) and other subsidiaries engaged
in the homebuilding business. Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc.’s operating subsidiaries include
Pulte Home Corporation, Pulte International Corporation (“International”) and other subsidiaries
engaged in the homebuilding business. Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc.’s non-operating thrift
subsidiary, First Heights Holding Corp, LLC (“First Heights”), is classified as a discontinued
operation (see Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements). We also have a mortgage banking
company, Pulte Mortgage LLC (“Pulte Mortgage”), which is a subsidiary of Pulte Home Corporation.

In December 2005, we sold substantially all of our Mexico homebuilding operations, realizing
cash of $131.5 million, as further described in Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements.
For 2005 and all prior periods reported, the Mexico operations have been presented as discontinued
operations.

In January 2005, we sold all of our Argentina operations, as further described in Note 3 of
our Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2004 the Argentina operations were
classified as held for sale. For 2004 and 2003, the Argentina operations have been presented as
discontinued operations.

We have two reportable business segments, Homebuilding and Financial Services:

•

Homebuilding, our core business, is engaged in the acquisition and development of land
principally for residential purposes within the continental United States and Puerto Rico
and the construction of housing on such land targeted for the first-time, first and second
move-up, and active adult home buyers.

•

The Financial Services segment consists principally of mortgage banking and title
operations conducted through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries.

Financial information, including revenue, pre-tax income and total assets of each of our
business segments is included in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Consistent with our strategy of serving all major customer segments: first-time, first and
second move-up and active adult, our communities offer a wide variety of home designs including
single family detached, townhouses, condominiums and duplexes at different prices and with varying
levels of options and amenities. Expanding the number of customer segments served within each of
our markets has enabled us to approximately double our annual closings over the past five years to
a record 45,630 homes closed in 2005. Over our 55-year history, we have delivered more than
453,000 homes throughout the United States.

On July 31, 2001, we merged with Del Webb in a tax-free stock-for-stock transaction. This
merger expanded and supported our leadership position. In particular, we believe the merger
strengthened our position among active adult (age 55 and older) homebuyers, added important
strategic land positions, provided operational savings from economies of scale, bolstered our
purchasing leverage, and enhanced our overall competitive position. In accordance with our
operational strategy, we continue to evaluate available strategic acquisition opportunities that
are consistent with our long-range goals.

As of December 31, 2005, our Homebuilding operations offered homes for sale in 662 communities
at sales prices ranging from $62,000 to $2.4 million. Sales prices of homes currently offered for
sale in 66% of our communities fall within the range of $100,000 to $350,000 with a 2005 average
unit selling price of $315,000, compared with $287,000 in 2004, $259,000 in 2003, $242,000 in
2002, and $225,000 in 2001. Sales of single-family detached homes, as a percentage of total unit
sales, decreased to 72% in 2005, from 80% in 2004, 83% in 2003, 86% in 2002, and 82% in 2001. This
trend can be attributed to an increase in sales of townhouses, condominiums and duplexes, which are
most popular among our first-time and active adult homebuyers. Our Homebuilding operations are
geographically diverse and, as a result, better insulate us from demand changes in individual
markets. As of December 31, 2005, our Homebuilding business operated in 54 markets spanning 27
states, with 17,817 units in backlog valued at approximately $6.3 billion.

Land acquisition and development

We select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing extensive
market research, enabling us to match the location and product offering with our targeted consumer
group. We consider factors such as proximity to developed areas, population and job growth
patterns and, if applicable, estimated development costs. We historically have managed the risk of
controlling our land positions through use of option contracts and outright acquisition. We
typically control land with the intent to complete sales of housing units within 24 to 36 months
from the date of opening a community, except in the case of certain Del Webb active adult
developments and other selected large projects for which the completion of community build out
requires a longer time period due to typically larger project sizes. As a result, land is
generally purchased after it is properly zoned and developed or is ready for development. In
addition, we dispose of owned land not required in the business through sales to appropriate end
users. Where we develop land, we engage directly in many phases of the development process,
including land and site planning, obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals, as well
as constructing roads, sewers, water and drainage facilities and other amenities. We use our staff
and the services of independent engineers and consultants for land development activities. Land
development work is performed primarily by independent contractors and local government authorities
who construct sewer and water systems in some areas. At December 31, 2005, we controlled
approximately 363,000 lots, of which 174,000 were owned and 189,000 were under option agreements.



Homebuilding Operations (continued)

Sales and marketing

We are dedicated to improving the quality and value of our homes through innovative
proprietary architectural and community designs and state-of-the-art customer marketing techniques.
Analyzing various qualitative and quantitative data obtained through extensive market research, we
segment our potential customers into well-defined buyer profiles. Segmentation analysis provides a
method for understanding the business opportunities and risks across the full spectrum of consumer
groups in each market. Once the demands of potential buyers are understood, we link our home
design and community development efforts to the specific lifestyle of each targeted consumer group.

To meet the demands of our various customers, we have established a solid design expertise for
a wide array of product lines. We believe that we are an innovator in the design of our homes and
we view design capacity as an integral aspect of our marketing strategy. Our in-house
architectural services teams and management, supplemented by outside consultants, are successful in
creating distinctive design features, both in exterior facades and interior options and features.
In certain markets our strategy is to offer “the complete house” in which all features shown in the
home are included in the sales price. Standard features typically offered include vaulted
ceilings, appliances, and a variety of available flooring and carpet.

Typically, our sales teams, together with outside sales brokers, are responsible for guiding
the customer through the sales process. We are committed to industry-leading customer service
through a variety of quality initiatives, including the customer care program, which ensures that
homeowners are comfortable at every stage of the building process. Using a seven-step, interactive
process, homeowners are kept informed during their homebuilding and home owning experience. The
steps include (1) a pre-construction meeting with the superintendent; (2) pre-dry wall frame walk;
(3) quality assurance inspection; (4) first homeowner orientation; (5) 30-day follow-up after the
close of the home; (6) three-month follow-up; and (7) an 11-month quality list after the close of
the home. Fully furnished and landscaped model homes are used to showcase our homes and their
distinctive design features. We have great success with the first-time buyer in the low to
moderate price range; in such cases, financing under United States Government-insured and
guaranteed programs is often used and is facilitated through our mortgage company. We also enjoy
strong sales to the move-up buyer and, in certain markets, offer semi-custom homes in higher price
ranges.

Through our Del Webb brand, we are better able to address the needs of active adults, among
the fastest growing homebuying segments. We offer both destination communities and “in place”
communities, for those buyers who prefer to remain in their current geographic area. These
communities, with highly amenitized products such as golf courses, recreational centers and
educational classes, offer the active adult buyer many options to maintain an active lifestyle.

We have received recognition and awards as a result of our achievements as a homebuilder. In
March 2005, Pulte was named as a Top-Ranked Homebuilder in BusinessWeek’s List of 50 Best
Performers among the S&P 500, coming in at number 12. In April 2005, we were ranked 181 on the
Fortune 500 List. Additionally, in May 2005 we were named to the Fortune Magazine List of Most
Desirable MBA Employers for 2005. In July 2005, we also made our first appearance on the Fortune
40 List of “Best Stocks to Buy Now”.

In addition, our Austin, Chicago, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Detroit, Ft. Myers/Naples, Houston,
Jacksonville, Las Vegas, Minneapolis/St. Paul, North Inland Empire, Orlando, Palm Beach,
Philadelphia, Tampa Bay, Tucson, and Washington, D.C. markets were recognized for ranking the
highest in their markets in a national customer satisfaction study. Eight of our markets came in
second place, while three obtained third place positions. The survey of thirty U.S. markets (with
Pulte presence in twenty-seven of those markets) noted customer service, home readiness at the time
of closing, and the company’s sales staff as the three factors that most heavily influenced the
customer’s overall level of satisfaction. Developing the Pulte Homes brand and leveraging the
strength of the “DiVosta,” “Del Webb” and “Sun City” tradenames helps to distinguish our
communities from the competition, and can often be rewarded with the advantages of additional sales
pace, choice community locations, and reduced overall customer acquisition costs.

Our Homeowner for Life

TM

philosophy has increased our business from those who have
previously owned a Pulte home or have been referred by a Pulte homeowner by ensuring a positive
home buying and home owning experience. We introduce our homes to prospective buyers through a
variety of media advertising, illustrated brochures, Internet listings and link placements, and
other advertising displays. In addition, our websites,

www.pulte.com, www.delwebb.com,
www.divosta.com,

and

www.espanol.pulte.com

provide tools to help users find a home that meets their
needs, investigate financing alternatives, communicate moving plans, maintain a home, learn more
about us and communicate directly with us. Approximately 5.1 million potential customers visited
our websites during 2005.



Homebuilding Operations (continued)

Construction

The construction process for our homes begins with the in-house design of the homes we sell.
The building phase is conducted under the supervision of our on-site construction superintendents.
The construction work is usually performed by independent contractors under contracts that, in many
instances, cover both labor and materials on a fixed-price basis. We believe that Pulte Preferred
Partnerships (P


), an extension of our quality assurance program, continues to establish
new standards for contractor relations. Using a selective process, we have teamed up with what we
believe are premier contractors and suppliers to improve all aspects of the land development and
house construction processes.

We maintain efficient construction operations by using standard materials and components from
a variety of sources and, when possible, by building on contiguous lots. To minimize the effects
of changes in construction costs, the contracting and purchasing of building supplies and materials
generally is negotiated at or near the time when related sales contracts are signed. In addition,
we leverage our size by actively negotiating our materials needs on a national or regional basis to
minimize production component cost. We are also working to establish a more integrated system that
can effectively link suppliers, contractors and the production schedule through various strategic
business partnerships and e-business initiatives.

We cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials will be available at
reasonable prices in the future and have, on occasion, experienced shortages of skilled labor in
certain trades and of building materials in some markets.

Competition and other factors

Our operations are subject to building, environmental and other regulations of various
federal, state, and local governing authorities. For our homes to qualify for Federal Housing
Administration (“FHA”) or Veterans Administration (“VA”) mortgages, we must satisfy valuation
standards and site, material and construction requirements of those agencies. Our compliance with
federal, state, and local laws relating to protection of the environment has had, to date, no
material effect upon capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. More stringent
requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers, thereby increasing the
cost of compliance.

Our dedication to customer satisfaction is evidenced by our consumer and value-based brand
approach to product development, and is something that we believe distinguishes us in the
homebuilding industry and contributes to our long-term competitive advantage. The housing industry
in the United States, however, is highly competitive. In each of our market areas, there are
numerous homebuilders with which we compete. We also compete with the resales of existing house
inventory. Any provider of housing units, for-sale or to rent, including apartment builders, may
be considered a competitor. Conversion of apartments to condominiums further provides certain
segments of the population an alternative to traditional housing, as does manufactured housing. We
compete primarily on the basis of price, reputation, design, location and quality of our homes.
The housing industry is affected by a number of economic and other factors including: (1)
significant national and world events, which impact consumer confidence; (2) changes in the costs
of building materials and labor; (3) changes in interest rates; (4) changes in other costs
associated with home ownership, such as property taxes and energy costs; (5) various demographic
factors; (6) changes in federal income tax laws; (7) changes in government mortgage financing
programs, and (8) availability of sufficient mortgage capacity. In addition to these factors, our
business and operations could be affected by shifts in demand for new homes.

Financial Services Operations

We conduct our financial services business, which includes mortgage and title operations,
through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries. Our mortgage bank arranges financing through the
origination of mortgage loans primarily for the benefit of our homebuyers, but also services the
general public. We also engage in the sale of such loans and the related servicing rights. We are
a lender approved by the FHA and VA and are a seller/servicer approved by Government National
Mortgage Association (“GNMA”), Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”), Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”) and other investors. In our conventional mortgage lending
activities we follow underwriting guidelines established by FNMA, FHLMC, and private investors.

Our mortgage underwriting, processing and closing functions are centralized in Denver,
Colorado and Charlotte, North Carolina using a mortgage operations center (“MOC”) concept. We
also use a centralized telephone loan officer concept where loan officers are centrally located at
mortgage application centers (“MAC”) in Denver and Charlotte. Our sales representatives, who are
the mortgage customers’ main contact, forward the loan applications to a MAC loan counselor who
calls the customer to complete the loan application and then forwards it to the MOC for processing.
We believe both the MOC and the MAC improve the speed and efficiency of our mortgage operations,
thereby improving our profitability and allowing us to focus on creating attractive mortgage
financing opportunities for our customers.

In originating mortgage loans, we initially use our own funds and borrowings made available to
us through various credit arrangements. Subsequently, we sell such mortgage loans and
mortgage-backed securities to outside investors.



Financial Services Operations (continued)

Our capture rate for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 was approximately 89%,
88%, and 83%, respectively. Our capture rate represents loan originations from our homebuilding
business as a percent of total loan opportunities, excluding cash settlements, from our
homebuilding business. During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, we originated
mortgage loans for approximately 75%, 72%, and 65%, respectively, of the homes we sold. Such
originations represented 98%, 92%, and 83%, respectively, of our total originations.

We sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts to
reduce the risks inherent in servicing loans. This strategy results in owning the servicing rights
for only a short period of time, generally less than four months after the loan is originated,
which substantially reduces the risk of impairment with respect to the fair value of these reported
assets. The servicing sales contracts provide for the reimbursement of payments made when loans
prepay within specified periods of time, usually 90 days after sale or securitization.

The mortgage industry in the United States is highly competitive. We compete with other
mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide attractive mortgage financing to both our
homebuyers and to the general public. The Internet is also an important resource for homebuyers in
obtaining financing as a number of companies provide online approval for their customers. These
Internet-based mortgage companies may also be considered competitors.

In originating and servicing mortgage loans, we are subject to rules and regulations of the
FHA, VA, GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC. In addition to being affected by changes in these programs, our
mortgage banking business is also affected by several of the same factors that impact our
homebuilding business.

Financial Information About Geographic Areas

We currently operate primarily within the United States and have some non-operating foreign
entities, which are insignificant to our consolidated financial results.

Discontinued operations

Mexico Homebuilding Operations

In January 2005, the minority shareholders of Pulte Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V. (“Pulte Mexico”)
exercised a put option under the terms of a reorganization agreement dated as of December 31, 2001,
to sell their shares to us, the consummation of which resulted in our owning 100% of Pulte Mexico.
In March 2005, we purchased 60% of the minority interest of Pulte Mexico for approximately $18.7
million in cash. In June 2005, we purchased the remaining 40% of the minority interest of Pulte
Mexico for approximately $12.5 million in cash.

In December 2005, we sold substantially all of our Mexico homebuilding operations to a
consortium of purchasers involved in residential and commercial real estate development. The
disposition of the Mexico homebuilding operations will enable us to invest additional resources in
the U.S. housing market. We realized cash of $131.5 million related to the sale. The sale of
these operations did not include our investment in the capital stock of a mortgage company in
Mexico as well as various non-operating entities. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we
recognized a pre-tax loss of $6.6 million (after-tax loss of $13.1 million) related to the sale of
our Mexico homebuilding operations. For 2005 and all periods reported, the Mexico homebuilding
operations have been presented as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Previously, the Mexico homebuilding operations were included in the Homebuilding segment.



Discontinued operations (continued)

Argentina

In January 2005, we sold all of our Argentina operations to an Argentine company involved in
residential and commercial real estate development. The disposition of these operations was the
chosen action to improve our overall returns. At December 31, 2004 the Argentina operations were
classified as held for sale. For 2004 and 2003, the Argentina operations have been presented as
discontinued operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

First Heights

During the first quarter of 1994, we adopted a plan of disposal for First Heights and
announced our strategy to exit the thrift industry and increase our focus on housing and related
mortgage banking. First Heights sold all but one of its 32 bank branches and related deposits to
two unrelated purchasers. The sale was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 1994.
Although we expected to complete the plan of disposal within a reasonable period of time,
contractual disputes precluded us from completing the disposal in accordance with our original
plan.

In August 2005, the United States Court of Appeals affirmed the United States Court of Federal
Claims final judgment that we had been damaged by approximately $48.7 million as a result of the
United States government’s breach of contract in connection with the enactment of Section 13224 of
the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. In December 2005, we received payment of the
judgment in the amount of $48.7 million, which was recorded as income from discontinued operations.

In September 2005, First Heights received notice confirming the voluntary dissolution of the
First Heights Bank. The Office of Thrift Supervision also canceled First Heights’ charter.
Accordingly, the day-to-day activities of First Heights, which had been principally devoted to
supporting residual regulatory compliance matters and the litigation with the United States
government, have now ceased.

Other non-operating

Other non-operating is comprised primarily of Pulte Homes, Inc. and Pulte Diversified
Companies, Inc., both of which are holding companies. The primary purpose of these entities is to
support the operations of our subsidiaries by acting as the internal source of financing,
developing and implementing strategic initiatives centered around new business development and
operating efficiencies. Business development activities include the pursuit of additional
opportunities as well as the development of innovative building components and processes. Other
non-operating also includes the activities associated with supporting a publicly traded entity
listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

Other non-operating assets include equity investments in subsidiaries, short-term financial
instruments and affiliate advances. Liabilities include senior and subordinated debt and income
taxes. Other non-operating revenues consist primarily of investment earnings of excess funds,
while expenses include costs associated with supporting a publicly traded company and its
subsidiaries’ operations, and investigating strategic initiatives.

Organization/Employees

All subsidiaries and operating units operate independently with respect to daily operations.
Homebuilding real estate purchases and other significant homebuilding, mortgage banking, financing
activities and similar operating decisions must be approved by the business unit and/or corporate
senior management.

At December 31, 2005, we employed approximately 13,400 people. Our employees are not
represented by any union. Contracted work, however, may be performed by union contractors.
Homebuilding and mortgage banking management personnel are paid performance bonuses and incentive
compensation. Performance bonuses are based on individual performance while incentive compensation
is based on the performance of the applicable business unit or subsidiary. Our corporate
management personnel are paid incentive compensation based on our overall performance. Each
subsidiary is given autonomy regarding employment of personnel, although our senior corporate
management acts in an advisory capacity in the employment of subsidiary officers. We consider our
employee and contractor relations to be satisfactory.



ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on Form 10-K should
be read together with the risk factors set forth below. They describe various risks and
uncertainties to which we are, or may become subject. These risks and uncertainties, together with
other factors described elsewhere in this report, have the potential to affect our business,
financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies or prospects in a material and
adverse manner.

Downward changes in general economic, real estate construction or other business conditions could
adversely affect our business or our financial results.

The residential homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other
factors, such as the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of
financing and interest rate levels. Adverse changes in any of these conditions generally, or in
the markets where we operate, could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or
result in customer cancellations of pending contracts, which could adversely affect the number of
home deliveries we make or reduce the prices we can charge for homes, either of which could result
in a decrease in our revenues and earnings.

The homebuilding industry has not experienced an economic down cycle in a number of years, which
may have resulted in an overvaluation of land and new homes.

Although the homebuilding business historically has been cyclical, it has not undergone an
economic down cycle in a number of years. Further, in recent years, land and home prices rose
significantly in many of our markets. This has led some people to assert that the prices of land,
new homes and the stock prices of homebuilding companies may be inflated and may decline if the
demand for land and new homes weakens. A decline in the prices for land and new homes could
adversely affect both our revenues and margins. A decline in our stock price could make raising
capital through stock issuances more difficult and expensive.

Future increases in interest rates, reductions in mortgage availability or increases in the
effective costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and
adversely affect our business or our financial results.

Most of our customers finance their home purchases through our mortgage bank. Interest rates
have been at historical lows for several years. Many homebuyers have also chosen adjustable rate,
interest only or mortgages that involve initial lower monthly payments. As a result, new homes
have been more affordable. Increases in interest rates or decreases in availability of mortgage
financing, however, could reduce the market for new homes. Potential homebuyers may be less
willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs or to obtain mortgage financing that exposes
them to interest rate changes. Lenders may increase the qualifications needed for mortgages or
adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk. Even if potential customers do not need
financing, changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to
sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing. These factors could adversely
affect the sales or pricing of our homes and could also reduce the volume or margins in our
financial services business. Our financial services business could be impacted to the extent we
are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate through the
various hedging strategies we employ.

In addition, we believe that the availability of FHA and VA mortgage financing is an important
factor in marketing some of our homes. We also believe that the liquidity provided by Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac to the mortgage industry is important to the housing market. However, the federal
government has recently sought to reduce the size of the home-loan portfolios and operations of
these two government-sponsored enterprises. Any limitations or restrictions on the availability of
the financing or on the liquidity by them could adversely affect interest rates, mortgage financing
and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans.

Our future growth may require additional capital, which may not be available.

Our operations require significant amounts of cash. We may be required to seek additional
capital, whether from sales of equity or debt or additional bank borrowings, for the future growth
and development of our business. We can give no assurance as to the availability of such
additional capital or, if available, whether it would be on terms acceptable to us. Moreover, the
indentures for most of our outstanding public debt and the covenants of our revolving credit
facility contain provisions that may restrict the debt we may incur in the future. If we are not
successful in obtaining sufficient capital, it could reduce our sales and may adversely affect our
future growth and financial results.



Competition for homebuyers could reduce our deliveries or decrease our profitability.

The housing industry in the United States is highly competitive. We compete primarily on the
basis of price, reputation, design, location and quality of our homes. We compete in each of our
markets with numerous national, regional and local homebuilders. This competition with other
homebuilders could reduce the number of homes we deliver, or cause us to accept reduced margins in
order to maintain sales volume.

We also compete with resales of existing used or foreclosed homes, housing speculators and
available rental housing. Increased competitive conditions in the residential resale or rental
market in the regions where we operate could decrease demand for new homes and increase
cancellations of sales contracts in backlog.

Our success depends on our ability to acquire land suitable for residential homebuilding at
reasonable prices, in accordance with our land investment criteria.

The homebuilding industry is highly competitive for suitable land. The availability of
finished and partially finished developed lots and undeveloped land for purchase that meet our
internal criteria depends on a number of factors outside our control, including land availability
in general, competition with other homebuilders and land buyers for desirable property, inflation
in land prices, and zoning, allowable housing density and other regulatory requirements. Should
suitable lots or land become less available, the number of homes we may be able to build and sell
could be reduced, and the cost of land could be increased, perhaps substantially, which could
adversely impact our results of operations.

Our long-term ability to build homes depends on our acquiring land suitable for residential
building at reasonable prices in locations where we want to build. Over the past few years, we
have experienced an increase in competition for suitable land as a result of land constraints in
many of our markets. As competition for suitable land increases, and as available land is
developed, the cost of acquiring suitable remaining land could rise, and the availability of
suitable land at acceptable prices may decline. Any land shortages or any decrease in the supply
of suitable land at reasonable prices could limit our ability to develop new communities or result
in increased land costs. We may not be able to pass through to our customers any increased land
costs, which could adversely impact our revenues, earnings, and margins.

Supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials
could increase costs and delay deliveries.

The homebuilding industry is highly competitive for skilled labor and materials. Increased
costs or shortages of skilled labor and/or lumber, framing, concrete, steel and other building
materials could cause increases in construction costs and construction delays. We generally are
unable to pass on increases in construction costs to those customers who have already entered into
sale contracts, as those sales contracts generally fix the price of the home at the time the
contract is signed, which may be well in advance of the construction of the home. Sustained
increases in construction costs may, over time, erode our margins, and pricing competition for
materials and labor may restrict our ability to pass on any additional costs, thereby decreasing
our margins.

Government regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and
homebuilding projects or affect our related financial services operations and adversely affect our
business or financial results.

Our operations are subject to building, environmental and other regulations of various
federal, state, and local governing authorities. For our homes to qualify for FHA or VA mortgages,
we must satisfy valuation standards and site, material and construction requirements of those
agencies. Our compliance with federal, state, and local laws relating to protection of the
environment has had, to date, no material effect upon capital expenditures, earnings or competitive
position. More stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and
developers, thereby increasing the cost of compliance.

New housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools, parks, streets and
other public improvements. These can cause an increase in the effective prices for our homes. In
addition, increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities, as recently
experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding, can adversely affect the ability of
potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes.



Government regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and
homebuilding projects or affect our related financial services operations and adversely affect our
business or financial results. (continued)

We also are subject to a variety of local, state and federal laws and regulations concerning
protection of health, safety and the environment. The impact of environmental laws varies
depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in
areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available. These
matters may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance, remediation and other
costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in
environmentally sensitive regions or areas.

Our financial services operations are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws
and regulations. These include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs
and compliance with consumer lending and similar requirements such as disclosure requirements,
prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures. They may also subject
our operations to examination by applicable agencies. These may limit our ability to provide
mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes.

Homebuilding is subject to warranty and liability claims in the ordinary course of business that
can be significant.

As a homebuilder, we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in
the ordinary course of business. We record warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based
on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with
the types of homes built. We have, and require the majority of our subcontractors to have, general
liability, property, errors and omissions, workers compensations and other business insurance.
These insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims, subject to
certain self-insured retentions, deductibles, and other coverage limits. Through our captive
insurance subsidiaries, we reserve for costs to cover our self-insured and deductible amounts under
these policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits, based on an analysis of our historical
claims, which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Because of the
uncertainties inherent to these matters, we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage,
our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all our warranty and
construction defect claims in the future. Contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce, we
may be responsible for applicable self-insured retentions and some types of claims may not be
covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits. Additionally, the coverage offered
by and the availability of general liability insurance for construction defects are currently
limited and costly. We have responded to the recent increases in insurance costs and coverage
limitations by increasing our self-insured retentions and claim reserves. There can be no
assurance that coverage will not be further restricted and become more costly.

Natural disasters and severe weather conditions could delay deliveries, increase costs and decrease
demand for new homes in affected areas.

Our homebuilding operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters
and severe weather. The occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new
home deliveries, increase costs by damaging inventories, reduce the availability of materials and
negatively impact the demand for new homes in affected areas. Furthermore, if our insurance does
not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events, our earnings,
liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected.

Inflation may result in increased costs that we may not be able to recoup if demand declines.

Inflation can have a long-term impact on us because increasing costs of land, materials and
labor may require us to increase the sales prices of homes in order to maintain satisfactory
margins. However, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which have a negative
impact on housing demand, in which case we may not be able to raise home prices sufficiently to
keep up with the rate of inflation and our margins could decrease.

Future terrorist attacks against the United States or increased domestic and international
instability could have an adverse effect on our operations.

A future terrorist attack against the United States could cause a sharp decrease in the number
of new contracts signed for homes and an increase in the cancellation of existing contracts.
Accordingly, adverse developments in the war on terrorism, future terrorist attacks against the
United States, or increased domestic and international instability could adversely affect our
business.



ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

This Item is not applicable.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Our homebuilding and corporate headquarters are located at 100 Bloomfield Hills Parkway,
Bloomfield Hills, Michigan 48304, where we lease 90,828 square feet of office space. We lease
54,380 square feet of office space at 1230 West Washington Street, Tempe, Arizona 85281 for certain
corporate and business services. Pulte Mortgage’s offices are located at 7475 South Joliet Street,
Englewood, Colorado 80112, 99 Inverness Drive East, Englewood, Colorado 80112, and 12300 East
Arapahoe Road, Centennial, Colorado 80112. We lease approximately 61,436 square feet, 24,400
square feet and 43,050 square feet, respectively, of office space at these locations. In 2005,
Pulte Mortgage leased 31,803 square feet of office space at 3700 Arco Corporate Drive, Charlotte,
North Carolina 28273. Our homebuilding markets and mortgage branch operations generally lease
office space for their day-to-day operations.

Because of the nature of our homebuilding operations, significant amounts of property are held
as inventory in the ordinary course of our homebuilding business. Such properties are not included
in response to this Item.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are involved in various litigation incidental to our continuing business operations. We
believe that none of this litigation will have a material adverse impact on our results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.

Storm Water Discharge Practices

In April 2004, we received a request for information from the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (“EPA”) pursuant to Section 308 of the Clean Water Act. The request seeks
information about storm water discharge practices in connection with homebuilding projects
completed or underway by us. We have provided the EPA with this information. Although the matter
has since been referred to the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) for enforcement, the EPA
has asked that we engage in “pre-filing” negotiations to resolve the matter short of litigation.
We are actively engaged in these negotiations. If the negotiations fail and the DOJ alleges that
we have violated regulatory requirements applicable to storm water discharges, the government may
seek injunctive relief and penalties. We believe that we have defenses to any such allegations.
At this time, however, we can neither predict the outcome of this inquiry, nor can we currently
estimate the costs that may be associated with its eventual resolution.

First Heights-related litigation

We were a party to a lawsuit relating to First Heights’ 1988 acquisition from the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (“FSLIC”) and First Heights’ ownership of five failed Texas
thrifts. The lawsuit was filed on December 26, 1996, in the United States Court of Federal Claims
(Washington, D.C.) by Pulte Homes, Inc., Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc. and First Heights
(collectively, “the Pulte Parties”) against the United States. We asserted breach of contract on
the part of the United States in connection with the enactment of Section 13224 of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (“OBRA”). That provision repealed portions of the tax benefits
that we claim we were entitled to under the contract to acquire the failed Texas thrifts. We also
asserted other claims concerning the contract, including that the United States (through the FDIC
as receiver) improperly attempted to amend the failed thrifts’ pre-acquisition tax returns and that
this attempt was made in an effort to deprive us of tax benefits for which they had contracted.

On August 17, 2001, the United States Court of Federal Claims ruled that the United States
government was liable to us for breach of contract by enacting Section 13224 of OBRA. In September
2003, the United States Court of Federal Claims issued final judgment that we had been damaged by
approximately $48.7 million as a result of the United States government’s breach of contract with
us. The United States government and we appealed the final judgment to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit in October 2003.

In August 2005, the Appeals Court affirmed the United States Court of Federal Claims judgment,
in its entirety. In December 2005, we received payment of the judgment in the amount of $48.7
million, which was recorded as income from discontinued operations.

Homebuilding Operations



Overview (continued)

Financial Services Operations

•

Mortgage origination units, origination principal and our capture rate increased
during 2005, 2004 and 2003. Pre-tax income of our financial services business segment
increased 49% from 2005 to 2004, due to a more favorable product mix to funded, from
non-funded, originations. Pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2004
decreased 31% compared with 2003 due to a shift in our product mix, starting in the
second half of 2003, toward adjustable rate mortgages (“ARMs”) versus fixed rate
mortgages due to changes in customer mortgage product preference.

Other non-operating

•

Other non-operating expenses, net consists of income and expenses related to
Corporate services provided to our subsidiaries. During 2005, net interest expense
decreased due to an increase in the amount of interest capitalized into homebuilding
inventory, as well as an increase in interest income. Other corporate expenses, net
increased during 2005 as a result of higher compensation-related costs. During 2004,
net interest expense increased due to higher debt levels as a result of our growth.
Other expenses, net in 2004 were impacted by increased charitable contributions
expense. In addition, income recognized during 2003 from the sale and adjustment to
fair value of various non-operating parcels of commercial land held for sale did not
recur in 2004, resulting in higher net expense.

Homebuilding Operations (continued)

Continued strong demand for new homes, an increase in the number of active selling communities
and market share expansion, drove increases in net new orders, unit settlements and unit backlog.
Net new orders increased 17% to a record 47,531 units for the year ended December 31, 2005. Net
new orders for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased 16% to 40,576 units compared with 34,989
units for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Home settlements set a record for the year ended December 31, 2005 at 45,630 units, an
increase of 18% over the same period in 2004. In 2004, home settlements also reached a record
high, increasing 18% to 38,612 units. Active communities increased from 535 in 2003 to 626 in 2004
to 662 in 2005.

Changes in average selling price reflect a number of factors, including price increases, the
mix of product closed during a period and the number of options purchased by customers. The
average selling price for our homes increased 10% for the year ended December 31, 2005, to $315,000
compared with 2004 and increased to $287,000 in 2004 from $259,000 in 2003. The most significant
price increases for both 2005 and 2004 were in the West and Northeast geographic areas, and in
Florida in the Southeast geographic area.

Ending backlog, which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed, grew to a record
17,817 units at December 31, 2005 compared with 15,916 units at December 31, 2004 and 13,952 units
at December 31, 2003. The dollar value of our backlog was up 22% to $6.3 billion at December 31,
2005, compared with $5.2 billion at December 31, 2004 and $4.1 billion at December 31, 2003. Our
most significant increase in unit backlog at December 31, 2005, occurred in the Central region,
which had unit increases of 106%, resulting from increased net new orders. Our most significant
increases at December 31, 2004, occurred in the Southeast and West, which had unit increases of 42%
and 10% respectively.

In the fourth quarter of 2004, we lowered pricing in Las Vegas to better align pricing in our
communities with pricing in the market. This action was in response to a period of slow sign-ups
and increased cancellation rates, which we attributed to our then above-market pricing. However,
since the price reductions took effect in the fourth quarter of 2004, our communities in Las Vegas
have experienced improved traffic and new order activity.

The West contributed the largest portion of our operating activities, compared with the other
geographic areas in the homebuilding operations, representing 35% of unit settlements and 34% of
unit net new orders for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared with 37% of settlements and of
net new orders during 2004, and 35% of settlements and 37% of net new orders during 2003. The West
also contributed the largest portion of our backlog, compared with other geographic areas in the
homebuilding operations, representing 39%, 43% and 44% of the total homebuilding backlog units at
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The following table presents markets that represent 10% or more of unit new orders, unit

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, our Homebuilding operations controlled approximately 362,600
and 343,400 lots, respectively. Approximately 173,800 and 158,000 lots were owned and
approximately 133,400 and 125,800 lots were under option agreements approved for purchase at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In addition, there were approximately 55,400 lots under
option agreements at December 31, 2005, pending approval, that are under review and evaluation for
future use by our Homebuilding operations. This compared to 59,600 lots at December 31, 2004.

The total purchase price applicable to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding
operations at future dates approximated $5.7 billion at December 31, 2005. In addition, the total
purchase price applicable to land under option pending approval was valued at $1.9 billion at
December 31, 2005. Land option agreements, which may be cancelled at our discretion, may extend
over several years and are secured by deposits and advanced costs totaling $444.8 million, which
are generally non-refundable.

Homebuilding interest expense, which represents the amortization of
capitalized interest, is included in homebuilding cost of sales.

Homebuilding gross profit margins from home sales in 2005 increased 80 basis points over
2004 to 23.4%, and in 2004 increased 200 basis points to 22.6% compared with 2003. The increases
are due to strong consumer demand, positive home pricing, favorable shifts in product and
geographic mix, the benefits of leverage-buy purchasing activities and effective production and
inventory management. During the fourth quarter of 2005, homebuilding gross profit margins were
22.3% compared with 22.7% in the same period of 2004. This margin decrease of 40 basis points is
attributable primarily to a 4% inflationary increase in land development costs, such as
petroleum-based products and cement. Under our accounting policies, lot costs are expensed on an
average project cost basis. Due to the significant cost increases experienced in the fourth
quarter of 2005, we have adjusted our estimates accordingly. Such adjustments impacted the amount
of lot costs recognized and will continue to affect lot costs prospectively.



Homebuilding Operations (continued)

We consider land acquisition one of our core competencies. We acquire land primarily for the
construction of our homes for sale to homebuyers. We will often sell select parcels of land within
or adjacent to our communities to retail and commercial establishments. We also will, on occasion,
sell lots within our communities to other homebuilders. Gross profits from land sales were $18.2
million and $99.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively,
representing a decrease of $81.6 million and an increase of $33.9 million, respectively, from the
previous year’s total. Revenues and their related gains/losses may vary significantly between
periods, depending on the timing of land sales. We continue to evaluate our existing land
positions to ensure the most effective use of capital. Included in other assets is approximately
$257.7 million in land held for disposition as of December 31, 2005, as compared to $230.1 million
and $251.2 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a
percentage of home settlement revenues, decreased 110 basis points to 7.7% compared with 2004 after
decreasing 90 basis points to 8.8% in 2004 compared with 2003. The conversion improvement in 2005
can be attributed to an increase in average selling prices, our internal initiatives focused on
controlling costs and better overhead leverage as a result of volume increases. The improvement
in 2004 can be attributed to greater leverage as a result of volume increases and the favorable
pricing environment for our homes.

Equity income for 2005 and 2004 includes earnings from our 50% investment in a Nevada-based
joint venture, related to the sale of commercial and residential properties. Also included are
earnings from our 50% joint venture that supplies and installs basic building components and
operating systems, acquired in January 2004. In January 2006, we exercised our option to purchase
the remaining 50% interest in the entity. In 2006, this investment will become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company and will be consolidated in our financial statements.

Other income (expense), net includes the write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs
resulting from decisions not to pursue certain land acquisitions and options, insurance-related
expenses and settlements and other non-operating expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2005
and 2004, the changes in other income (expense), net are due primarily to write-offs of deposit and
pre-acquisition costs. These write-offs vary in amount from year to year as we continue to
evaluate potential land acquisitions for the most effective use of capital.

Financial Services Operations

We conduct our financial services business, which includes mortgage and title operations,
through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries.

We originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various
credit arrangements, and then sell such mortgage loans to outside investors. Also, we sell our
servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts. Due to the short
period of time the servicing rights are held, generally less than four months, we do not amortize
the servicing asset. Since the servicing rights are recorded based on the value in the servicing
sales contracts, there are no impairment issues related to these assets.

Financial Services Operations (continued)

Mortgage origination unit and principal volume for the year ended December 31, 2005, increased
22% and 27%, respectively, over 2004. Mortgage origination unit and principal volume for the year
ended December 31, 2004, increased 23% and 35%, respectively, over 2003. This growth can be
attributed to increases in the capture rate of 140 basis points to 89.2% in 2005 and 510 basis
points to 87.8% in 2004, combined with the volume increases experienced in our homebuilding
business and an increase in average loan size. Our capture rate represents loan originations from
our homebuilding business as a percent of total loan opportunities, excluding cash settlements,
from our homebuilding business. Our homebuilding customers continue to account for the majority of
total loan production, representing 98% of Pulte Mortgage unit production for 2005, compared with
92% in 2004 and 83% in 2003.

Adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) represented 45% of total funded origination dollars and 39%
of total funded origination units for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with 43% and 42%,
respectively, in 2004 and 24% and 22%, respectively, in 2003. Interest only mortgages, a component
of ARMs, represented 65% of ARMs origination dollars and 56% of ARMs origination units for the year
ended December 31, 2005, compared with 42% and 30% in 2004, and 13% and 8%, respectively, in 2003.
Interest only mortgages represented 29%, 18%, and 3%, respectively, of total funded origination
dollars for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Refinancings represented 1% of total loan production in 2005, compared with 3% in 2004 and 8%
in 2003. Our customers’ average FICO scores for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003
were 741, 737, and 724, respectively. Combined Loan-to-Value was 81% for the years ended December
31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. At December 31, 2005, loan application backlog was $4.2
billion, compared with $3.5 billion and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Pre-tax income increased 49% for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with 2004, due to
increased volume and a favorable product mix shift to funded, from non-funded originations. In
2005, 26% of total origination dollars were from brokered loans, which are less profitable to us,
compared with 36% in 2004. Mortgage origination fees of $20.7 million in 2005 were $0.2 million,
or 1%, higher than the $20.5 million recorded for the same period in 2004. The 1% increase over the
same period in 2004 is due to higher revenues per loan as brokered origination volume decreased 7%
in 2005 when compared to 2004.

The net gain from sale of mortgages of $81.1 million in 2005 was $30.8 million, or 61%, higher
than the $50.3 million recorded for the same period in 2004. This favorable variance was due
primarily to an increase in loans available for sale combined with a more favorable interest rate
environment in 2005 when compared to 2004. Net interest income in 2005 was $10 million, or 3%,
higher than the $9.7 million for the same period in 2004. The increase was due mainly to increased
funded origination volume offset by a lower interest rate margin. Income from our title operations
was $22.3 million in 2005, an increase of 27% over 2004. Selling, general and administrative
expense increased $10 million, or 17%, from 2004, due primarily to an increase in origination
volume.

Our minority interest in Su Casita, a Mexican mortgage banking company, contributed income
from operations of approximately $350 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2005. During
February 2005, 25% of our investment in the capital stock of Su Casita was redeemed for a gain of
approximately $620 thousand. Our remaining interest of 16.66% was accounted for under the cost
method of accounting and therefore no income was recorded for periods subsequent to the sale.
Income from Su Casita for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, was $4 million and $4.4
million, respectively. In February 2006, we completed the sale of our remaining investment in Su
Casita for approximately $50 million, and realized a pre-tax gain of approximately $30 million
related to the transaction.

Pre-tax income decreased 31% for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared with 2003, as
increased volume was offset by changes in product mix to ARMs, which generally have a lower profit
per loan than fixed rate products. The shift to ARMs is attributable to customer mortgage product
preference. In addition, in 2004, 36% of total origination dollars were from brokered loans, which
are less profitable to us, compared with 16% in 2003. Mortgage origination fees increased to $20.5
million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared with $7.5 million in 2003, due to the
increase in brokered loans. Gains from the sale of mortgages during 2004 decreased $14.1 million,
or 22%, from $64.4 million in 2003, and net interest income decreased $5.5 million, to $9.7 million
during 2004 as compared with $15.1 million in 2003. These decreases were due to the product mix
shifts and an unfavorable interest rate environment in 2004 compared with 2003. Income from our
title operations was $17.6 million in 2004, an increase of 30% over 2003. Selling, general and
administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2004, increased 41% to $57.5 million
compared with 2003 due to increased origination volume.

We hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with
derivative financial instruments. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we did not recognize any
material net gains or losses related to an ineffective portion of the hedging instrument. We also
did not recognize any material net gains or losses during 2005 for cash flow hedges that were
discontinued because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur. At
December 31, 2005, we expect to reclassify $18 thousand, net of taxes, of net losses on derivative
instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months
from sales of closed mortgage loans.



Other non-operating

Other non-operating expenses, net consists of income and expenses related to Corporate
services provided to our subsidiaries. These expenses are incurred for financing, developing and
implementing strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating
efficiencies, and providing the necessary administrative support associated with being a publicly
traded entity listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Accordingly, these results will vary from
year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve.

Interest expense, net of interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory, decreased 9% to
$43.3 million in 2005 and increased 20% to $47.4 million in 2004. The decrease for the year ended
December 31, 2005, compared with the prior year, is due to an increase in the amount of interest
capitalized into homebuilding inventory as well as an increase in interest income. The increase
for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared with the prior year, is due to an increase in the
debt levels necessary to support our growth.

The increase in other expenses, net for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with the
prior year was due to higher compensation-related costs. Other expenses, net in 2004 increased
$7.3 million compared with 2003 partially due to increased charitable contributions. Additionally,
during 2004 and 2003 we recognized income from the sale and adjustment to fair value of various
non-operating parcels of commercial land held for sale.

Interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory is charged to home cost of sales based on the
cyclical timing of our unit settlements over a period that approximates the average life cycle of
our communities. During 2005, interest in homebuilding inventory increased primarily as a result
of higher levels of inventory and debt consistent with the growth of our Company. During the
fourth quarter of 2005, we increased the amount of interest capitalized into homebuilding
inventory. The increase was based on our homebuilding inventory and debt levels and is consistent
with the growth of the Company. Information related to Corporate interest capitalized into
homebuilding inventory is as follows ($000’s omitted):

Discontinued Operations

First Heights

— In September 2003, the United States Court of Federal Claims issued
final judgment that Pulte Homes, Inc., Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc. and First Heights
(collectively, the Pulte Parties) had been damaged by approximately $48.7 million as a result of
the United States government’s breach of contract with them. The final judgment follows the
Court’s August 17, 2001 ruling that the United States breached the contract related to the Pulte
Parties’ 1988 acquisition of five savings and loan associations by enacting Section 13224 of the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. The United States government and the Pulte Parties filed
Notices of Appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in October 2003.

In August 2005, the United States Court of Appeals affirmed the United States Court of Federal
Claims’ judgment, in its entirety, that we had been damaged by approximately $48.7 million as a
result of the United States government’s breach of contract in connection with the enactment of
Section 13224 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. In December 2005, we received
payment of the judgment in the amount of $48.7 million, which was recorded as income from
discontinued operations.

We also recorded non-cash, after-tax gains of $7.8 million, $10.8 million and $7.9 million,
during the third quarter of 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to the favorable resolution
of certain tax matters relating to our former thrift operation, which was discontinued in 1994.

Mexico

— In January 2005, the minority shareholders of Pulte Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V.
(“Pulte Mexico”) exercised a put option under the terms of a reorganization agreement dated as of
December 31, 2001, to sell their shares to us, the consummation of which resulted in our owning
100% of Pulte Mexico. In March 2005, we purchased 60% of the minority interest of Pulte Mexico for
approximately $18.7 million in cash. In June 2005, we purchased the remaining 40% of the minority
interest of Pulte Mexico for approximately $12.5 million in cash. We assigned approximately $17.6
million of the purchase price premium to house and land inventory, which was amortized through cost
of sales as homes were sold. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of
the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed, of $5.3 million, was recorded as goodwill.

In December 2005, we sold substantially all of our Mexico homebuilding operations to a
consortium of purchasers involved in residential and commercial real estate development. The
disposition of the Mexico homebuilding operations will allow us to invest additional resources in
the U.S. housing market. We realized cash of $131.5 million related to the sale. The sale of
these operations did not include our investment in the capital stock of a mortgage company in
Mexico as well as various non-operating entities, which are not considered to be material to our
results of operations or our financial position.

Revenues of these discontinued operations were $201 million, $185.8 million and $172.3 million
for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. For the years ended December
31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, discontinued Mexico homebuilding operations reported total after-tax
income (losses) of ($1.5) million, $4.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively. Results of Mexico
homebuilding operations, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, resulted in pre-tax
operating income of $4.6 million, $8.2 million and $4.6 million, respectively.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized a pre-tax loss of $6.6 million (after-tax
loss of $13.1 million) related to the sale of our Mexico homebuilding operations. The pre-tax loss
on sale includes the accounting recognition of the economic losses related to accumulated foreign
currency translation adjustments of $7.6 million, which had previously been reported in other
comprehensive income, as well as the write-off of $5.3 million of goodwill related to the 2005
acquisition of the minority shareholder interests. At December 31, 2005, the Mexico homebuilding
operations have been presented as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Previously, the Mexico homebuilding operations were included in the Homebuilding segment. Certain
amounts previously reported in the 2004 and 2003 financial statements and notes thereto were
reclassified to conform to the 2005 presentation.

Concurrent with the sale of the Mexico homebuilding operations, we elected to repatriate all
of our earnings from our Mexico operations in accordance with the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004 (Internal Revenue Code Section 965, Temporary Dividends Received Deduction) and recorded $4.8
million of related income taxes, which have been included in the Mexico loss on sale from
discontinued operations.



Discontinued Operations (continued)

Argentina

— In January 2005, we sold all of our Argentina operations to an Argentine
company involved in residential and commercial real estate development. The disposition of these
operations was the chosen action to improve our overall returns. At December 31, 2004, the Argentina operations were classified as held for sale and presented as
discontinued operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Previously, the Argentina
operations were included in the Homebuilding segment.

For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, discontinued Argentine operations reported
after-tax losses of $1.4 million and $1.9 million, respectively. In addition, we recognized a
pre-tax loss of $33.2 million ($20.6 million after-tax) on the write-down of the Argentina
operations to fair value less costs to sell. At December 31, 2004, foreign currency translation
losses of $25.1 million, which were previously recorded as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income on the balance sheet, were recognized in the income statement in connection
with the classification of these operations as held for sale. These translation losses were
included in the overall pre-tax loss of $33.2 million on the write-down to fair value. For the
year ended December 31, 2003, we recorded a foreign currency translation gain of $1.9 million for
Argentina as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet.

Total assets to be disposed of at December 31, 2004 were $15.4 million, consisting primarily
of cash and inventories. Total liabilities to be disposed of at December 31, 2004 were $13.7
million and consisted primarily of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We finance our homebuilding land acquisitions, development and construction activities from
internally generated funds and existing credit agreements.

At December 31, 2005, we had cash and equivalents of $1 billion and $3.4 billion of senior
notes outstanding. Other financing included limited recourse collateralized financing totaling
$28.6 million. Sources of our working capital include our cash and equivalents, our $1.66 billion
committed unsecured revolving credit facility and Pulte Mortgage’s $990 million committed credit
arrangements.

Our debt-to-total capitalization, excluding our collateralized debt, was approximately 36.2%
at December 31, 2005, and approximately 28.6% net of cash and equivalents. We routinely monitor
current operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate the use of available
financing sources, including securities offerings.

Pulte Mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds
and borrowings made available pursuant to various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements.
At December 31, 2005, Pulte Mortgage had committed credit arrangements of $990 million comprised of
a $390 million bank revolving credit facility and a $600 million asset-backed commercial paper
program. The asset-backed commercial paper program was temporarily increased to $600 million in
December 2005 due to high year-end volume. It was reduced back to $550 million in January 2006.

Our income tax liability and related effective tax rate are affected by a number of factors.
In 2005, our effective tax rate was 36.9% compared to 37.6% in 2004 and 37.9% in 2003. The
reduction in the effective tax rate for 2005 was principally due to the new manufacturing deduction
established by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The reduction in the effective tax rate for
2004 was principally due to the favorable resolution of certain state tax matters. We anticipate
that our effective tax rate for 2006 will be approximately 37%.

Our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2005, amounted
to $18.7 million, while net cash used in operating activities was $692.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. The increase from 2004 to 2005 was principally due to an increase in net
income, which included $48.7 million of cash income received as a result of a favorable judgment
for our former thrift operation. Our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended
December 31, 2003, was $336.4 million. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the
increases in net income were offset primarily by significant investments in land necessary to
support the continued growth of the business.



Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)

Cash used in investing activities was $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005,
compared with $198.6 million in the prior year. The change in net cash used in investing
activities primarily relates to proceeds from the sale of subsidiaries during 2005 of $142.9
million, increases in distributions from unconsolidated entities of $41.9 million, offset by
increases in capital expenditures of $13.7 million. During 2005, we invested approximately $37.3
million in three new joint ventures that develop and/or sell land within the United States. Also,
we contributed $124.6 million of additional capital contributions to and received $108 million in
capital distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2005.
Further, we incurred approximately $88.9 million in capital expenditures to support the growth of
our business. Cash used in investing activities was $198.6 million for the year ended December 31,
2004, compared with $4.3 million in the prior year. The change in net cash used in investing
activities primarily relates to our investments in unconsolidated entities. During January 2004,
we invested $35 million for a 50% ownership interest in an entity that supplies and installs basic
building components and operating systems. During 2004, we invested approximately $117.8 million
in three new joint ventures that develop and/or sell land in the United States. Also, we
contributed $44.2 million of additional capital contributions to and received $66.1 million in
capital distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $700.4 million for the year ended December
31, 2005. Cash inflows from financing activities of $1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005
are primarily attributed to proceeds from our $350 million, 5.2% senior notes and $300 million, 6%
senior notes issued in February 2005, proceeds from Pulte Mortgage’s line of credit of
approximately $275.6 million, proceeds from limited recourse collateralized financing arrangements
of approximately $46.8 million, and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $31.2 million.
Cash outflows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily relate to
the repayment of our $125 million, 7.3% senior notes in October 2005, approximately $33.6 million
of cash dividends paid to our shareholders, and $143.2 million used to repurchase our common stock.

Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $809.6 million for the year ended December
31, 2004. Cash inflows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 are primarily
attributed to proceeds received from our $500 million, 5.25% senior notes issued in January 2004
and our $400 million, 4.875% senior notes issued in July 2004 and $44 million of cash received from
the exercise of stock options. Cash outflows from financing activities for the year ended December
31, 2004 primarily relate to the repayment of our $112 million, 8.375% senior notes in August 2004,
redemption of the remaining $77 million of Del Webb 10.25% senior subordinated notes in February
2004, approximately $25.4 million of cash dividends paid to our shareholders, $44.9 million used to
repay borrowings, and $14.7 million used to repurchase our common stock.

Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003, was $128.9
million, reflecting proceeds from the $300 million senior notes issued in February and the $400
million senior notes issued in May and proceeds from employee stock option exercises, offset by the
repayment of debt, dividends paid and stock repurchases.

In February 2005, we sold $350 million of 5.2% senior notes, which mature on February 15,
2015, and $300 million of 6% senior notes, which mature on February 15, 2035, which are guaranteed
by us and certain of our 100%-owned subsidiaries. These notes are unsecured and rank equally with
all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. Proceeds from the sale were used to
repay the indebtedness of our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes,
including continued investment in our business.

In October 2005, we restructured and amended the 5-year unsecured revolving credit facility,
increasing the borrowing availability from $1.38 billion to $1.615 billion, and extending the
maturity date from September 2009 to October 2010, with pricing more favorable to us. We
subsequently increased the credit facility to $1.66 billion. The credit facility includes an
uncommitted accordion feature, under which the credit facility may be increased to $2.25 billion.
We have the capacity to issue letters of credit up to $1.125 billion. Borrowing availability is
reduced by the amount of letters of credit outstanding. The credit facility contains restrictive
covenants, the most restrictive of which requires us not to exceed a debt-to-total capitalization
ratio of 60% as defined in the agreement.

Pursuant to the two $100 million stock repurchase programs authorized by our Board of
Directors in October 2002 and 2005 (for a total stock repurchase authorization of $200 million), we
have repurchased a total of 6,120,800 shares for $180.5 million. At December 31, 2005, we had
remaining authorization to purchase common stock aggregating $19.5 million. In February 2006, our
Board of Directors approved an increase to our stock repurchase authorization for an additional
$200 million in open-market transactions or otherwise.

In July 2005, our Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split effected in the form
of a 100 percent stock dividend. The additional shares of common stock were distributed on
September 1, 2005, to the shareholders of record as of August 15, 2005. In December 2003, we
announced a two-for-one stock split effected in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend. The
distribution was made on January 2, 2004. All share and per share amounts have been restated to
retroactively reflect the stock splits.



Inflation

We, and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high
inflation because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation also increases our financing,
labor and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the
affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass to our
customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. For the three months ended
December 31, 2005, our gross margins have been negatively impacted by approximately 40 basis points
due to inflation, compared to the same period in the prior year. For the year ended December 31,
2005, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there
is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of
operations.

We are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts
(including option contracts) for the purchase, development and sale of real estate in the
routine conduct of our business. Option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer
acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we
are ready to build homes on them. This reduces our financial risks associated with long-term
land holdings. At December 31, 2005, we had agreements to acquire approximately 189,000
homesites through option contracts and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments.
At December 31, 2005 we had $444.8 million of non-refundable option deposits and advanced
costs related to certain of these agreements.

volume. It was returned to $550 million in January 2006.

(d)

Excludes performance and surety bonds of approximately $1.8 billion, which
typically do not have stated expiration dates.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We use standby letters of credit and performance bonds to guarantee our performance under
various contracts, principally in connection with the development of our projects. The expiration
dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related
projects. If the obligations related to a project are ongoing, annual extensions of the letters of
credit are typically granted on a year-to-year basis. At December 31, 2005, we had outstanding
letters of credit of $531.5 million. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates;
rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. These bonds,
which approximated $1.79 billion at December 31, 2005, are typically outstanding over a period that
approximates 3-5 years. We do not believe that we will be required to draw upon any such letters
of credit or performance bonds.

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land option or option type agreements in
order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future. At December 31, 2005, these
agreements totaled approximately $7.6 billion. Pursuant to these land option agreements, we
provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times
in the future, usually at predetermined prices. If the entity holding the land under option is a
variable interest entity, our deposit represents a variable interest in that entity. At December
31, 2005, we consolidated certain variable interest entities with assets totaling $76.7 million.

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures was
$882.2 million and $58.1 million, respectively. The increase in debt at December 31, 2005 is a
result of the growth in the number of joint venture arrangements as well as increased land
development activities for these entities. Our proportionate share of our joint venture debt as of
December 31, 2005 was approximately $294 million, for which we provide limited recourse debt
guarantees, of approximately $288 million. Accordingly, we may be liable, on a contingent basis,
through limited guarantees with respect to a portion of the secured land acquisition and
development debt. However, we would not be liable other than in instances of fraud,
misrepresentation or other bad faith actions by us, unless the joint venture was unable to perform
its contractual borrowing obligations. As of December 31, 2005, we do not anticipate that we will
incur any significant costs under these guarantees.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with United
States generally accepted accounting principles. When more than one accounting principle, or the
method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that is
appropriate in our specific circumstances (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements). Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the
future resolution of existing uncertainties; as a result, actual results could differ from these
estimates. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, we have made our best estimates
and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements,
giving due regard to materiality. The development and selection of the following critical
accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors.

Revenue recognition

Homebuilding

— Homebuilding revenues are recorded when the sales of homes are
completed and ownership has transferred to the customer. Unfunded settlements are deposits in
transit on homes for which the sale was completed. We do not engage in arrangements whereby we
have ongoing relationships with our homebuyers that require us to repurchase our homes or provide
homebuyers with the right of return.

Financial
Services

— Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans
for various investors. Servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding
principal balance, or a contracted set fee in the case of certain sub-servicing, and are credited
to income when related mortgage payments are received. Loan origination fees, commitment fees and
certain direct loan origination costs are deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the related
mortgage loan until such loan is sold. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are
recognized when the loans are sold. Interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is
originated until the loan is sold.

Inventory valuation

Our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated costs or net realizable value.
Included in inventories are all direct development costs. Inventories under development or held
for development are stated at accumulated cost, unless they are determined to be impaired, in which
case these inventories are measured at fair value. If actual market conditions are less favorable
than those projected by management, additional inventory adjustments may be required.

We capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories. Interest capitalized each quarter
is identified as a separate layer in our capitalized interest balance sheet pool. Each layer of
capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities
under development. Interest expense is allocated to the quarters over the amortization period based
on the cyclical timing of unit settlements.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)

Inventory valuation (continued)

Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis. Under the specific identification
basis, cost of sales includes the construction cost of the home, an average lot cost by project
based on land acquisition and development costs, and closing costs and commissions. Construction
cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home, plus an accrual for
costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost. This accrual
is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared to the amount
accrued, and adjustments are made if needed. Total project land acquisition and development costs
are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared to actual costs incurred to date and estimates
to complete. Adjustments to estimated total project land acquisition and development costs for the
project affect the amount of future lots costed.

Residential mortgage loans available-for-sale

Residential mortgage loans available-for-sale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or
market value. Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are
sold. We hedge our residential mortgage loans available-for-sale. Gains and losses from closed
commitments and futures contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on the sale of
mortgage loans.

Goodwill and intangible assets

We have recorded certain intangible assets and goodwill, most of which relate to the Del Webb
merger in 2001. Intangible assets, primarily trademarks and tradenames, were valued using proven
valuation procedures and are amortized over their estimated useful life. Goodwill is subject to
annual impairment testing. The carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is
dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use.
If our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly, intangible assets and
goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material. If we determine
that the carrying value of intangible assets, long-lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable
based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we measure impairment based on
one of three methods. For assets related to ongoing operations, we use a projected undiscounted
cash flow method to determine if impairment exists and then measure impairment using discounted
cash flows. For assets to be disposed of, we assess the fair value of the asset based on current
market conditions for similar assets. For goodwill, we assess fair value by measuring discounted
cash flows of our reporting units and measure impairment as the difference between the resulting
implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value.

The estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments
regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control. Changes in these
estimates could result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and material
charges to the results of operations.

Allowance for warranties

Home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building defects. The specific
terms and conditions of those warranties vary geographically. Most warranties cover different
aspects of the home’s construction and operating systems for a period of up to ten years. We
estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of
such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability
include the number of homes sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per
claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts
as necessary. Although we have not made significant adjustments to the accrual in the past, actual
warranty cost in the future could differ from our current estimate.

Insurance

We have, and require the majority of our subcontractors to have, general liability, property,
errors and omissions, workers compensation and other business insurance. These insurance policies
protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self-insured
retentions, deductibles, and other coverage limits. Through our captive insurance subsidiaries, we
reserve for costs to cover our self-insured and deductible amounts under those policies and for any
costs of claims and lawsuits in excess of our coverage limits or not covered by such policies,
based on an analysis of our historical claims, which includes an estimate of claims incurred but
not yet reported. Our total reserves for such items were $153.4 million and $115.6 million at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Expenses related to such claims were approximately $70.1
million, $58.4 million, and $40.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003,
respectively.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)

Stock-based compensation

On December 15, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, which amends SFAS
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS No. 123(R) requires that all share-based
payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be accounted for at fair value.
The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 no longer will be an alternative
to financial statement recognition. Under SFAS No. 123(R), we must determine the appropriate fair
value model to be used for valuing share-based payments, the amortization method for compensation
cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption. We previously adopted the
fair-value-based method of accounting for share-based payments under SFAS No. 123 effective January
1, 2003 using the prospective method described in SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation—Transition and Disclosure. Currently, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option
pricing model to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees, and will continue to use
this model upon adoption of SFAS 123(R). Because SFAS No. 123(R) must be applied not only to new
awards but to previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the effective date, and we
adopted SFAS No. 123 using the prospective transition method (which applied only to awards granted,
modified or settled after the adoption date), compensation cost for some previously granted awards
that was not recognized under SFAS No. 123 will be recognized under SFAS No. 123(R). In addition,
our stock option participant agreements provide continued vesting for certain retirement eligible
employees who have achieved a predetermined level of service based on their combined age and years
of service. We currently recognize the related compensation cost ratably over the nominal vesting
period. For awards granted after the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we will record related
compensation cost over the period through the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire
and is no longer required to provide services to earn the award. Because these amounts are not
significant, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) is not expected to have a material impact on our
results of operations or financial position. This statement is effective for fiscal periods
beginning after December 15, 2005.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ratified its Emerging Issues
Task Force consensus in Issue No. 04-5, “Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General
Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners
Have Certain Rights” (“Issue 04-5”). This guidance states that the general partner in a limited
partnership is presumed to control that limited partnership, with limited exceptions. We do not
expect the provisions of Issue 04-5 to impact our current accounting treatment for limited
partnerships because we are not a general partner. Issue 04-5 is effective June 29, 2005 for new
limited partnerships and existing limited partnerships where the partnership agreement has been
modified and is otherwise effective for the first fiscal period beginning after December 15, 2005
for all other limited partnerships.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections — a
replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3” (SFAS 154). This Statement replaces APB
Opinion No. 20, “Accounting Changes,” and SFAS No. 3, “Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim
Financial Statements,” and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a
change in accounting principle. This Statement requires retrospective application to financial
statements of prior periods for changes in accounting principle. This Statement is effective
January 1, 2006 and has been determined to have no impact on our results of operations or its
financial position.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position 109-1, “Application of FASB Statement No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided
by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004” (FSP 109-1). The American Jobs Creation Act, which was
signed into law in October 2004, provides a 3% tax deduction on qualified domestic production
activities income for 2005. When fully phased-in, the deduction will be 9% of the lesser of
“qualified production activities income” or taxable income. Based on the guidance provided by FSP
109-1, this deduction was accounted for as a special deduction under SFAS No. 109 and reduced tax
expense. Tax benefits resulting from the new deduction were recorded during 2005, and resulted in a
reduction in our federal income tax rate (see Note 9 to Consolidated Financial Statements).



ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are subject to interest rate risk on our rate-sensitive financing to the extent long-term

Pulte Mortgage, operating as a mortgage banker, is also subject to interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreed-upon terms (i.e.,
commit to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time). The interest rate risk
continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor. During 2005 and
2004, this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days. In periods of rising
interest rates, the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an
interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float.

We minimize interest rate risk by (i) financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing
agreement tied to LIBOR and A1/P1 commercial paper rates and (ii) hedging our loan commitments and
closed loans through derivative financial instruments. These financial instruments include cash
forward placement contracts on mortgage-backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options
on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage-backed
securities. We do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate
parallel shifts in long-term mortgage rates of plus 50, 100 and 150 basis points would not be
material to our financial results.

At December 31, 2005, our aggregate net investments exposed to foreign currency exchange rate
risk include our remaining non-operating investments in Mexico, which approximated $6.2 million,
and our mortgage banking joint venture investment in Mexico, which approximated $15.1 million.

PULTE HOMES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    Summary of significant accounting policies

Basis of presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pulte Homes, Inc., all of
its direct and indirect subsidiaries (the “Company”) and variable interest entities in which
the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The direct subsidiaries of Pulte Homes,
Inc. include Pulte Diversified Companies, Inc., Del Webb Corporation (“Del Webb”) and other
subsidiaries that are engaged in the homebuilding business. Pulte Diversified Companies,
Inc.’s operating subsidiaries include Pulte Home Corporation, Pulte International Corporation
(“International”) and other subsidiaries that are engaged in the homebuilding business. Pulte
Diversified Companies, Inc.’s former thrift subsidiary, First Heights Holding Corp, LLC
(“First Heights”), is classified as a discontinued operation (See Note 3). The Company also
has a mortgage banking company, Pulte Mortgage LLC (“Pulte Mortgage”), which is a subsidiary
of Pulte Home Corporation.

In December 2005, the Company sold substantially all of its Mexico homebuilding
operations realizing cash of $131.5 million as further described in Note 3. For the years
ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Mexico operations have been presented as
discontinued operations in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

In January 2005, the Company sold all of its Argentina operations, as further described
in Note 3. At December 31, 2004, the Argentina operations were classified as held for sale.
For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Argentina operations have been presented
as discontinued operations in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign currency

The financial statements of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries in Argentina and
Mexico were measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and
liabilities of these subsidiaries were translated at exchange rates as of the balance sheet
date. Revenues and expenses were translated at average exchange rates in effect during the
year. Cumulative translation adjustments of $7.6 million for the Company’s Mexico
homebuilding operations were recognized in December 2005 in connection with the sale of those
operations. The cumulative translation adjustment of $25.1 million for Argentina was
recognized in December 2004 in connection with the
classification of those operations as held for sale. Realized foreign currency transaction
gains and losses are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Realized foreign
currency transaction (gains) losses of $(1.6) million, $300 thousand, and $(70) thousand for
the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively were recorded in income from
discontinued operations.

Cash and equivalents

For purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, commercial paper and time
deposits with a maturity of three months or less when acquired are classified as cash
equivalents.

Investments in unconsolidated entities

The equity method of accounting is used for joint ventures and associated entities
over which the Company has significant influence; generally this represents partnership equity
or common stock ownership interests of at least 20% and not more than 50% (See Note 4). Under
the equity method of accounting, the Company recognizes its pro rata share of the profits and
losses of these entities. Certain of these entities sell lots and provide construction
services to the Company. Profits from such activities are deferred by the Company until which
time the related homes are sold.

The cost method of accounting is used for investments in which the Company has less than
a 20% ownership interest and does not have the ability to exercise significant influence.



PULTE HOMES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

1.   Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Goodwill

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the majority of goodwill, which represents the cost
of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of the net assets at the acquisition date,
resulted from the acquisition of Del Webb in 2001. All goodwill relates to the Homebuilding
segment, except for $700 thousand, which relates to the Financial Services segment. In
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, annually and
when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable,
management evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by comparing the carrying value of the
Company’s reporting units to their fair value. Fair value is determined based on discounted
future cash flows. The Company performed its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter
of 2005 and determined there to be no impairment of goodwill.

Intangible assets

Intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks and tradenames acquired in
connection with the 2001 acquisition of Del Webb and are included in the assets of the
Homebuilding segment. These intangible assets were valued at the acquisition date utilizing
proven valuation procedures and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a 20-year
life. The acquired cost and accumulated amortization of the Company’s intangible assets was
$163.5 million and $36.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005, and $163.5 million and
$28.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2004. Amortization expense was $8.2 million for
the year ended December 31, 2005 and $8.3 million for each of the years ended December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. Amortization expense for trademarks and tradenames is expected
to be approximately $8.2 million in each of the next 5 years.

Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators exist, an
assessment of undiscounted future cash flows for the assets related to these intangibles is
evaluated accordingly. If the results of the analysis indicate impairment, the assets are
adjusted to fair market value. During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, there
were no impairments of intangible assets.

Fixed assets and depreciation

Fixed assets are recorded at cost. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to
earnings as incurred. Depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method based
upon estimated useful lives as follows: Vehicles, three to five years, model and office
furniture, two to five years, and equipment,
three to ten years. Fixed assets are included in Other Assets and totaled $153.6 million net
of accumulated depreciation of $130.2 million at December 31, 2005 and $126.1 million net of
accumulated depreciation of $101.7 million at December 31, 2004. Total depreciation expense
for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $53.3 million, $38 million, and $31.2
million, respectively.



PULTE HOMES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

1.   Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Advertising cost

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. For the years ended December
31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company incurred advertising costs of approximately $94.1
million, $87.1 million and $79.7 million, respectively.

Employee benefits

The Company maintains one defined contribution plan that covers substantially all of
the Company’s employees. Company contributions to the plan are expensed as paid. The total
Company contributions pursuant to the plan were approximately $19.8 million, $15 million and
$9.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Insurance

The Company has, and requires the majority of its subcontractors to have, general
liability, property, errors and omissions, workers compensation and other business insurance.
These insurance policies protect the Company against a portion of its risk of loss from
claims, subject to certain self-insured retentions, deductibles, and other coverage limits.
Through its captive insurance subsidiaries, the Company reserves for costs to cover its
self-insured and deductible amounts under those policies and for any costs of claims and
lawsuits, based on an analysis of the Company’s historical claims, which includes an estimate
of claims incurred but not yet reported. The Company’s total reserves for such items were
$153.4 million and $115.6 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Expenses
related to such claims were approximately $70.1 million, $58.4 million, and $40.9 million for
the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders
(the “numerator”) by the weighted-average number of common shares, adjusted for nonvested
shares of restricted stock (the “denominator”) for the period. Computing diluted earnings per
share is similar to basic earnings per share, except that the denominator is increased to
include the dilutive effects of options and nonvested shares of restricted stock. Any options
that have an exercise price greater than the average market price are considered to be
anti-dilutive, and are excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation. For the year
ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, the Company had 161,109, 129,390 and 156,632
anti-dilutive outstanding stock options, respectively, which were excluded from this
calculation.

Fair values of financial instruments

The carrying amounts of cash and equivalents approximate their fair values due to
their short-term nature.

The fair value of residential mortgage loans available-for-sale is estimated using the
quoted market prices for securities backed by similar loans. Fair value exceeded cost by
approximately $10.8 million and $6.9 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Carrying amounts for financial derivative instruments reported in the balance sheet
approximate fair value as the amounts reported are based on current market prices. The
estimated fair values of financial instruments were determined by management using available
market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is
necessary to interpret the market data and develop the estimated fair value. Accordingly, the
estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize on
disposition of the financial instruments. Changes in the fair value of these instruments
would not have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations. The use of
different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the
estimated fair value amounts. At December 31, 2005, derivative assets, included in other
assets, in the balance sheet, totaled $5.3 million and derivative liabilities, included in
accrued and other liabilities, totaled $7.5 million. At December 31, 2004, derivative assets
totaled $3.8 million and derivative liabilities totaled $3.5 million.



PULTE HOMES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

1.   Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Fair values of financial instruments (continued)

The fair values of subordinated debentures and senior notes are based on quoted
market prices, when available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are
based on quoted market prices of similar issues.

Disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments are based on pertinent
information available to management as of December 31, 2005. Although management is not aware
of any factors that would significantly affect the reasonableness of the fair value amounts,
such amounts were not comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements
since that date and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts
presented herein.

Stock-based compensation

The Company currently has several stock-based employee compensation plans. Effective
January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the preferable fair value recognition provisions of SFAS
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” The Company selected the prospective
method of adoption as permitted by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation –
Transition and Disclosure.” Under the prospective method, the Company recognizes compensation
expense on an accelerated basis, based on the fair value provisions of SFAS No. 123.
Additionally, the Company recognizes compensation expense on the graded vesting method over
the vesting periods of the applicable stock options, generally four years. The graded vesting
method provides for vesting of portions of the overall awards at interim dates and results in
greater expense recorded in earlier years than the straight-line method. Grants made prior to
January 1, 2003 continue to be accounted for under the recognition and measurement principles
of APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related
Interpretations. With the exception of certain variable stock option grants, no stock-based
employee compensation cost is reflected in net income for grants made prior to January 1,
2003, as all options granted in those years had an exercise price equal to the market value of
the underlying common stock on the date of grant.

The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the
Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,” to all stock-based employee compensation. The fair value of each
option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model
with the following weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively: weighted-
average dividend yields of .39%, .33% and .44%, expected volatility of 40.1%, 36.6% and
35.3%, weighted-average risk-free interest rates of 4.6%, 3.80% and 3.57%, and
weighted-average expected lives of 5.62 years, 5.92 years and 6.76 years.

New accounting pronouncements

In June 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ratified its
Emerging Issues Task Force consensus in Issue No. 04-5, “Determining Whether a General
Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity
When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights” (“Issue 04-5”). This guidance states that the
general partner in a limited partnership is presumed to control that limited partnership, with
limited exceptions. The Company does not expect the provisions of Issue 04-5 to impact its
current accounting treatment for limited partnerships because the Company is not a general
partner. Issue 04-5 is effective June 29, 2005 for new limited partnerships and existing
limited partnerships where the partnership agreement has been modified and is otherwise
effective for the first fiscal period beginning after December 15, 2005 for all other limited
partnerships.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections — a
replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3” (SFAS 154). This Statement
replaces APB Opinion No. 20, “Accounting Changes,” and SFAS No. 3, “Reporting Accounting
Changes in Interim Financial Statements,” and changes the requirements for the accounting for
and reporting of a change in accounting principle. This Statement requires retrospective
application to financial statements of prior periods for changes in accounting principle. This
Statement is effective January 1, 2006 and has been determined to have no impact on the
Company’s results of operations or its financial position.

On December 15, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, which amends
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS No. 123(R) requires that all
share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be accounted
for at fair value. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 no
longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition. Under SFAS No. 123(R), the
Company must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share-based
payments, the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used
at date of adoption. The Company previously adopted the fair-value-based method of
accounting for share-based payments under SFAS No. 123 effective January 1, 2003 using the
prospective method described in SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation—Transition and Disclosure. Currently, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option
pricing model to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees, and will continue
to use this model upon adoption of SFAS 123(R). Because SFAS No. 123(R) must be applied not
only to new awards but to previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the effective
date, and the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 using the prospective transition method (which
applied only to awards granted, modified or settled after the adoption date), compensation
cost for some previously granted awards that was not recognized under SFAS No. 123 will be
recognized under SFAS No. 123(R). In addition, the Company’s stock option participant
agreements provide continued vesting for certain retirement eligible employees who have
achieved a predetermined level of service based on their combined age and years of service.
The
Company currently recognizes the related compensation cost ratably over the nominal vesting
period. For awards granted after the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company will record
related compensation cost over the period through the date the employee first becomes eligible
to retire and is no longer required to provide services to earn the award. Because these
amounts are not significant, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) is not expected to have a
material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial position. This statement
is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2005.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position 109-1, “Application of FASB Statement
No. 109

, Accounting for Income Taxes

, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities
Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004” (FSP 109-1). The American Jobs Creation
Act, which was signed into law in October 2004, provides a 3% tax deduction on qualified
domestic production activities income for 2005. When fully phased-in, the deduction will be
9% of the lesser of “qualified production activities income” or taxable income. Based on the
guidance provided by FSP 109-1, this deduction was accounted for as a special deduction under
SFAS No. 109 and reduced tax expense. Tax benefits resulting from the new deduction were
recorded during 2005, and resulted in a reduction in the Company’s federal income tax rate
(see Note 9).

Homebuilding

Inventories

Finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated cost or net realizable
value. Inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost,
unless certain facts indicate such cost would not be recovered from the cash flows generated
by future disposition. In this instance, such inventories are measured at fair value.

Sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis. Under the specific
identification basis, cost of sales includes the construction cost of the home, an average lot
cost by project based on land acquisition and development costs, and closing costs and
commissions. Construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of
the home, plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid, based on an analysis of
budgeted construction cost. This accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments
made after closing compared to the amount accrued, and adjustments are made if needed. Total
project land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs
compared to actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete. Adjustments to estimated
total project land acquisition and development costs for the project affect the amount of
future lots costed.

The Company capitalizes interest cost into homebuilding inventories. Each layer of
capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of
communities under development. Interest expense is allocated over the period based on the
cyclical timing of unit settlements. The Company capitalized interest in the amount of $185.8
million, $156.1 million and $136.3 million and expensed to home cost of sales $179.6 million,
$133 million and $78.7 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Land, not owned, under option agreements

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into land option agreements
in order to procure land for the construction of homes in the future. Pursuant to these land
option agreements, the Company
will provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at
different times in the future, usually at predetermined prices. Under FASB Interpretation No.
46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” as amended by FIN 46-R issued in December
2003 (collectively referred to as “FIN 46”), if the entity holding the land under option is a
variable interest entity, the Company’s deposit represents a variable interest in that entity.
Creditors of the variable interest entities have no recourse against the Company.

In applying the provisions of FIN 46, the Company evaluated all land option agreements
and determined that the Company was subject to a majority of the expected losses or entitled
to receive a majority of the expected residual returns under a limited number of these
agreements. As the primary beneficiary under these agreements, the Company is required to
consolidate variable interest entities at fair value. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the
Company classified $76.7 million and $106.4 million, respectively, as land, not owned, under
option agreements on the balance sheet, representing the fair value of land under contract,
including deposits of $13.4 million and $18.9 million, respectively. The corresponding
liability has been classified within accrued and other liabilities on the balance sheet.

Land option agreements that did not require consolidation under FIN 46 at December 31,
2005 and 2004, had a total purchase price of $7.6 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively. In
connection with these agreements, the Company had deposits and advanced costs of $431.4
million and $311.7 million, included in other assets at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

Homebuilding (continued)

Land held for sale

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had approximately $257.7 million and
$230.1 million of land held for sale related to the Company’s Homebuilding segment. Land held
for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell.

Allowance for warranties

Home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building defects. The
specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary geographically. Most warranties cover
different aspects of the home’s construction and operating systems for a period of up to ten
years. The Company estimates the costs to be incurred under these warranties and records a
liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that
affect the Company’s warranty liability include the number of homes sold, historical and
anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. The Company periodically assesses
the adequacy of its recorded allowance for warranties and adjusts the amount as necessary.

Changes to the Company’s allowance for warranties for the years ended December 31, 2005
and 2004, are as follows ($000’s omitted):

Revenues

Homebuilding revenues are recorded when the sales of homes are completed and
ownership has transferred to the customer. Unfunded settlements are deposits in transit on
homes for which the sale was completed.

Start-up costs

Costs and expenses associated with entry into new homebuilding markets and opening
new communities in existing markets are expensed when incurred.

Financial Services

Mortgage servicing rights

The Company allocates the cost of mortgage loans originated and purchased between
the mortgage loans and the
right to service those mortgage loans, based on relative fair value, on the date the loan is
sold.

The Company sells its servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing
sales contracts. Due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held, generally
less than four months, the Company does not amortize the servicing asset. Furthermore, there
are no impairment issues since the servicing rights are recorded based on the value in the
servicing sales contracts. The servicing sales contracts provide for the reimbursement of
payments made by the purchaser if loans prepay within specified periods of time, usually 90
days after sale or securitization. The Company established reserves for this liability of $5.2
million and $3.8 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, included in accrued and
other liabilities, at the time the sale was recorded. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, total
servicing rights recognized were $31.7 million, $25.3 million, and $36.7 million,
respectively.

Residential mortgage loans available-for-sale

Residential mortgage loans available-for-sale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost
or market value. Unamortized net mortgage discounts totaled $4.8 million and $2.1 million at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These discounts are not amortized as interest
revenue during the period the loans are held for sale.



PULTE HOMES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

1.   Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Financial Services (continued)

Residential mortgage loans available-for-sale (continued)

Gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold.
The Company hedges its residential mortgage loans available-for-sale. Gains and losses from
closed commitments and futures contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on
the sale of mortgage loans. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, net gains from the sale of mortgages
were $81.1 million, $50.3 million, and $64.4 million, respectively, which have been included
in Financial Services revenue.

Interest income on mortgage loans

Interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is
sold.

Mortgage servicing, origination and commitment fees

Mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors.
Servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance, or
a contracted set fee in the case of certain sub-servicing, and are credited to income when
related mortgage payments are received. Loan origination fees, commitment fees and certain
direct loan origination costs on funded loans are deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the
related mortgage loan until such loan is sold.

Derivative instruments and hedging activities

The Company recognizes all of its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities
in the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains
or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies
as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those
derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the Company
must designate the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as either a fair
value hedge or a cash flow hedge.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge (i.e.,
hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a
particular risk), the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is
reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the
same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. For derivative
instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the gain or loss is recognized in current
earnings during the period of change.

Market risks arise from commitments to lend, movements in interest rates and cancelled or
modified commitments to lend. In order to reduce these risks, the Company uses derivative
financial instruments. These financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts
on mortgage-backed securities, whole loan investor commitments, options on treasury futures
contracts, and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgage-backed securities. The
Company does not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. A commitment
to lend at a specified interest rate is a derivative instrument (interest rate is locked to
the borrower). When the Company commits to lend to the borrower, the Company enters into one
of the aforementioned derivative financial instruments to economically hedge the rate lock
derivative. The
changes in the value of the loan commitment and the derivative financial instrument are
recognized in current earnings during the period of change. At December 31, 2005, commitments
by the Company to originate mortgage loans totaled $292.1 million at interest rates prevailing
at the date of commitment.

Since the Company can terminate a loan commitment if the borrower does not comply with
the terms of the contract, and some loan commitments may expire without being drawn upon,
these commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company
evaluates the creditworthiness of these transactions through its normal credit policies.

Cash forward placement contracts on mortgage-backed securities are commitments to either
purchase or sell a specified financial instrument at a specified future date for a specified
price and may be settled in cash, by offsetting the position, or through the delivery of the
financial instrument. Options on treasury futures contracts and options on mortgage-backed
securities grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right to either purchase or sell a
specified treasury futures contract or a specified mortgage-backed security, respectively, for
a specified price within a specified period of time or on a specified date from or to the
writer of the option.



PULTE HOMES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

1.   Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Derivative instruments and hedging activities (continued)

Mandatory cash forward contracts on mortgage-backed securities are the predominant
derivative financial instruments used to minimize the market risk during the period from when
the Company extends an interest rate lock to a loan applicant until the time the loan is sold
to an investor. Whole loan investor commitments are obligations of the investor to buy loans
at a specified price within a specified time period. At December 31, 2005, the Company had
unexpired cash forward contracts and whole loan investor commitments of $1.1 billion. Options
on cash forward contracts on mortgage-backed securities are used in the same manner as
mandatory cash forward contracts, but provide protection from interest rates rising, while
still allowing an opportunity for profit if interest rates fall. Options on the treasury
futures contracts are used as cross hedges on various loan product types and to protect the
Company from unexpected increases, cancellations or modifications in lending commitments.
There were no outstanding options on treasury futures contracts at December 31, 2005.

The Company enters into derivative instruments to economically hedge portions of its
forecasted cash flow from sales of mortgage-backed securities with derivative financial
instruments. At December 31, 2005, the maximum length of time that the Company was exposed to
the variability in future cash flows of derivative instruments was approximately 80 days.
During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company did not recognize any material net gains
or losses related to an ineffective portion of the hedging instrument. In addition, the
Company did not recognize any material net gains or losses during the year ended December 31,
2005 for cash flow hedges that were discontinued because the forecasted transaction did not
occur. At December 31, 2005, the Company expects to reclassify $18 thousand, net of taxes, of
net losses on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings
during the next twelve months from sales of mortgage-backed securities.

2.   Segment information

The Company’s operations are classified into two reportable segments, Homebuilding and
Financial Services.

The Company’s Homebuilding segment is engaged in the acquisition and development of land
primarily for residential purposes within the continental United States and the construction
of housing on such land targeted for the first-time, first and second move-up, and active
adult home buyers. The Company’s Homebuilding segment is the aggregation of its related
operating segments.

The Company’s Financial Services segment consists principally of mortgage banking and
title operations conducted through Pulte Mortgage and other Company subsidiaries.

First Heights

In the first quarter of 1994, the Company adopted a plan of disposal for First Heights and
announced its strategy to exit the thrift industry and increase its focus on housing and related
mortgage banking. First Heights sold all but one of its 32 bank branches and related deposits
to two unrelated purchasers. The sale was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of
1994. Although the Company expected to complete the plan of disposal within a reasonable period
of time, contractual disputes precluded the Company from completing the disposal in accordance
with its original plan.

In August 2005, the United States Court of Appeals affirmed the United States Court of
Federal Claims final judgment, in its entirety, that the Company had been damaged by
approximately $48.7 million as a result of the United States government’s breach of contract in
connection with the enactment of Section 13224 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.
In December 2005, the Company received payment of the judgment in the amount of $48.7 million,
which was recorded as income from discontinued operations.

In September 2005, First Heights received notice confirming the voluntary dissolution of
the First Heights Bank. The Office of Thrift Supervision also canceled First Heights’ charter.
Accordingly, the day-to-day activities of First Heights, which had been principally devoted to
supporting residual regulatory compliance matters and the litigation with the United States
government (See Note 11), have now ceased.

Revenues of this discontinued operation were $10 thousand, $8 thousand, and $6 thousand for
the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003, discontinued thrift operations reported after-tax income of $56.5 million, $10.5
million and $7.3 million, respectively. The after-tax income for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003 include approximately $7.8 million, $10.8 million and $7.9 million,
respectively, of net income related to the recognition of income tax benefits resulting from the
favorable resolution of certain tax matters.

Mexico Homebuilding Operations

In January 2005, the minority shareholders of Pulte Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V. (“Pulte
Mexico”) exercised a put option under the terms of a reorganization agreement dated as of
December 31, 2001, to sell their shares to the Company, the consummation of which resulted in
the Company owning 100% of Pulte Mexico. In March 2005, the Company purchased 60% of the
minority interest of Pulte Mexico for approximately $18.7 million in cash. In June 2005, the
Company purchased the remaining 40% of the minority interest of Pulte Mexico for approximately
$12.5 million in cash. The Company assigned approximately $17.6 million of the purchase price
premium to house and land inventory, which was amortized through cost of sales as homes were
sold. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the underlying assets
acquired and liabilities assumed, of $5.3 million, was recorded as goodwill.

3. Discontinued operations (continued)

Mexico Homebuilding Operations (continued)

In December 2005, the Company sold substantially all of its Mexico homebuilding operations
to a consortium of purchasers involved in residential and commercial real estate development.
The disposition of the Mexico operations will allow the Company to invest additional resources
in the U.S. housing market. The Company realized cash of $131.5 million related to the sale.
The sale of these operations did not include the Company’s investment in the capital stock of a
mortgage company in Mexico as well as various non-operating entities, which are not considered
to be material to the Company’s results of operations or its financial position.

Revenues of these discontinued operations were $201 million, $185.8 million and $172.3
million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. For the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, discontinued Mexico homebuilding operations reported total
after-tax income (losses) of ($1.5) million, $4.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively. For
the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, Mexico reported pre-tax operating income of
$4.6 million, $8.2 million and $4.6 million, respectively.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recognized a pre-tax loss of $6.6 million
(after-tax loss of $13.1 million) related to the sale of its Mexico homebuilding operations.
The pre-tax loss on sale includes the accounting recognition of the economic losses related to
accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments of $7.6 million, which had previously been
reported in other comprehensive income, as well as the write-off of $5.3 million of goodwill
related to the January 2005 acquisition of the minority shareholder interests. At December 31,
2005, the Mexico operations have been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated
financial statements. Previously, the Mexico operations were included in the Homebuilding
segment. Certain amounts previously reported in the 2004 and 2003 financial statements and
notes thereto were reclassified to conform to the 2005 presentation.

Concurrent with the sale of its Mexico homebuilding operations, the Company elected to
repatriate all of its earnings from its Mexico operations in accordance with the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 (Internal Revenue Code Section 965, Temporary Dividends Received Deduction)
and recorded $4.8 million of related income taxes, which have been included in the Mexico loss
on sale from discontinued operations.

Argentina Operations

In January 2005, the Company sold all of its Argentina operations to an Argentine company
involved in residential and commercial real estate development. The disposition of these
operations was the chosen action to improve the Company’s overall returns. At December 31, 2004,
the Argentina operations were classified as held for sale and presented as discontinued
operations in the consolidated financial statements. Previously, the Argentina operations were
included in the Homebuilding segment.

Total assets to be disposed of at December 31, 2004 were $15.4 million. These assets
consisted primarily of cash and inventories and have been included in Other Assets. Total
liabilities to be disposed of at December 31, 2004 were $13.7 million and consisted primarily of
accounts payable and other accrued liabilities. The liabilities associated with the disposal
have been classified in accrued and other liabilities.

Revenues of these discontinued Argentine operations were $24.6 million and $37 million for
the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2004
and 2003 discontinued Argentine operations reported total after-tax losses of $22 million and
$1.9 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, Argentina reported
after-tax operating losses of $1.4 million and $1.9 million, respectively. In addition, the
Company recognized a pre-tax loss of $33.2 million ($20.6 million after-tax) on the write-down
of the Argentina operations to fair value less costs to sell. The pre-tax loss includes the
accounting recognition of the economic losses related to accumulated foreign currency
translation adjustments of $25.1 million ($15.6 million after-tax), which had previously been
reported in other comprehensive income.



PULTE HOMES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

4. Investments in unconsolidated entities

The Company participates in a number of joint ventures with independent third parties.
Many of these joint ventures purchase, develop and/or sell land and homes in the United States
and Puerto Rico. If additional capital infusions are required and approved, the Company would
need to contribute its pro-rata portion of those capital needs in order not to dilute its
ownership in the joint ventures. During 2005, the Company invested approximately $37.3 million
in three new joint ventures that develop and/or sell land within the United States.

In January 2004, the Company invested $35 million for a 50% ownership interest in an entity
that supplies and installs basic building components and operating systems, with an option to
purchase the remaining 50% interest in the entity in July 2006 or earlier in certain
circumstances. Effective January 2006, the Company exercised its option to purchase the
remaining 50% interest in this entity.

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures
was $882.2 million and $58.1 million, respectively. The increase in debt at December 31, 2005
is a result of the growth in the number of joint venture arrangements as well as increased land
development activities for these entities. The Company’s proportionate share of its joint
venture debt as of December 31, 2005 was approximately $294 million, for which the Company
provides limited recourse debt guarantees, of approximately $288 million. Accordingly, the
Company may be liable, on a contingent basis, through limited guarantees with respect to a
portion of the secured land acquisition and development debt. However, the Company would not be
liable other than in instances of fraud, misrepresentation or other bad faith actions by the
Company, unless the joint venture was unable to perform its contractual borrowing obligations.
As of December 31, 2005, we do not anticipate the Company will incur any significant costs under
these guarantees.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, we made additional capital contributions to these
joint ventures totaling approximately $124.6 million and received capital distributions from
these entities totaling approximately $108 million. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company
had approximately $286.6 million and $237.6 million, respectively, invested in these joint
ventures. These investments are included in the assets of the Company’s Homebuilding segment.
A majority of these investments are accounted for under the equity method, except for the
Company’s ownership interest in a Mexican mortgage banking company, as described below.

In February 2005, 25% of the Company’s investment in the capital stock of a mortgage
banking company in Mexico was redeemed for a gain of approximately $620 thousand. The Company’s
remaining ownership interest of 16.66% is accounted for under the cost method. At December 31,
2005 and 2004, the Company’s investment in this entity, which is included in the assets of the
Financial Services segment, was approximately $15.1 million and $21.1 million, respectively.
The Company does not have any purchase or investment commitments to this entity. Furthermore,
the Company has not guaranteed any of the indebtedness of this entity, which approximated $2.1
billion and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

5. Senior notes and subordinated notes (continued)

The Company’s $125 million, 7.3% unsecured senior notes were repaid in October 2005 using
its revolving credit facility and cash provided by operations.

In February 2005, the Company sold $350 million of 5.2% senior notes, which mature on
February 15, 2015, and $300 million of 6% senior notes, which mature on February 15, 2035, which
are guaranteed by Pulte Homes, Inc. and certain of its 100%-owned subsidiaries. These notes are
unsecured and rank equally with all of the Company’s other unsecured and unsubordinated
indebtedness. Proceeds from the sale were used to repay the indebtedness of the Company’s
revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including continued investment in
the Company’s business.

6. Other financing arrangements

Corporate/Homebuilding

In October 2005, the Company restructured and amended the 5-year unsecured revolving
credit facility, increasing the borrowing availability from $1.38 billion to $1.615 billion,
and extending the maturity date from September 2009 to October 2010, with pricing more
favorable to the Company. The Company subsequently increased the credit facility to $1.66
billion. The credit facility includes an uncommitted accordion feature, under which the credit
facility may be increased to $2.25 billion. The Company has the capacity to issue letters of
credit up to $1.125 billion. Borrowing availability is reduced by the amount of letters of
credit outstanding. The credit facility contains restrictive covenants, the most restrictive
of which requires the Company not to exceed a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 60%, as
defined in the agreement.

The following is a summary of aggregate borrowing information related to this facility

At December 31, 2005, other financing included limited recourse collateralized
financing arrangements totaling $28.6 million. These financing arrangements have maturities
ranging primarily from one to four years, a weighted average interest rate of 1.36%, are
generally collateralized by certain land positions and have no recourse to any other assets.
These arrangements have been classified as accrued and other liabilities in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

Financial Services

Notes payable to banks (collateralized short-term debt) are secured by residential mortgage
loans available-for-sale. The carrying amounts of such borrowings approximate fair value.

6. Other financing arrangements (continued)

Financial Services (continued)

Pulte Mortgage supports its operations through the use of a revolving credit facility and
an asset-backed commercial paper conduit. In July 2004, Pulte Mortgage expanded the capacity on
its revolving credit facility from $355 million to $390 million. This credit facility bears
interest at LIBOR plus an established margin and expires June 30, 2006. In September 2004,
Pulte Mortgage amended its commercial paper conduit, which is a $550 million committed line of
credit, which bears interest based on A1/P1 commercial paper plus an established margin and
expires August 2006. The amendment increased a sub-limit for eligible collateral, eliminated the
$50 million quarterly accordion feature, and made pricing more favorable to Pulte Mortgage. The
asset-backed commercial paper program was temporarily increased to $600 million in December 2005
due to high year-end volume. It was reduced back to $550 million in January 2006. The bank
credit agreement requires PMLLC to pay a fee for the committed credit line. PMLLC provides
compensating balances, in the form of escrows and other custodial funds, in order to further
reduce interest rates. The bank credit agreements contain restrictive covenants, the most
restrictive of which requires Pulte Mortgage to maintain a minimum tangible net worth of $30
million and funded debt cannot exceed 12 times tangible net worth.

During the three years ended December 31, 2005, Pulte Mortgage provided compensating
balances, in the form of escrows and other custodial funds, in order to further reduce interest
rates.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

9. Income taxes (continued)

In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company repatriated the earnings of its Mexican
subsidiaries. The earnings were distributed pursuant to the provisions of the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 (Internal Revenue Code Section 965, Temporary Dividends Received
Deduction). The income taxes associated with such repatriation, $4.8 million, were recorded
within the Mexico discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 provides a 3% tax deduction on qualified domestic
production activities income for 2005. When fully phased-in, the deduction will be 9% of the
lesser of “qualified production activities income” or taxable income. Based on the guidance
provided by FASB Staff Position 109-1, “Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American
Jobs Creation Act of 2004”, this deduction was accounted for as a special deduction under SFAS
No. 109 and reduced 2005 income tax expense.

The Company leases certain property and equipment under non-cancelable leases. Office and
equipment leases are generally for terms of three to five years and generally provide renewal
options for terms of up to an additional three years. Model home leases are generally for
shorter terms approximating one year with renewal options on a month-to-month basis. In most
cases, management expects that in the normal course of business, leases that expire will be
renewed or replaced by other leases. The future minimum lease payments required under operating
leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year are as follows

provide that the Company shall pay for insurance, taxes and

PULTE HOMES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

11. Commitments and contingencies

In the normal course of business, the Company acquires rights under options or option-type
agreements to purchase land to be used in homebuilding operations at future dates. The total
purchase price applicable to land under option that has been approved for purchase approximated
$5.7 billion and $4.1 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The total purchase
price applicable to land under option that has not been approved for purchase approximated $1.9
billion and $2.4 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. At December 31, 2005 and
2004, the Company, in the normal course of business, had outstanding letters of credit and
performance bonds of $2.3 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively.

The Company could be required to repurchase loans sold to investors that have not been
underwritten in accordance with the investor guidelines (“defective loans”). The Company, in
the normal course of business, indemnifies investors for defective loans that they have
purchased. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had been notified of $4.1 million and
$6.6 million of defective loans, respectively. The Company assesses the risk of loss on these
indemnifications and establishes reserves for them. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, reserves for
indemnification on defective loans are reflected in accrued and other liabilities and amounted
to $242 thousand and $390 thousand, respectively.

The Company is involved in various litigation incidental to its continuing business
operations. Management does not believe that this litigation will have a material adverse
impact on the results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.

Storm Water Discharge Practices

In April 2004, the Company received a request for information from the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) pursuant to Section 308 of the Clean Water Act. The
request seeks information about storm water discharge practices in connection with homebuilding
projects completed or underway by the Company. The Company has provided the EPA with this
information. Although the matter has since been referred to the United States Department of
Justice (“DOJ”) for enforcement, the EPA has asked that the Company engage in “pre-filing”
negotiations to resolve the matter short of litigation. The Company continues to participate
actively in these negotiations. If the negotiations fail and the DOJ alleges that the Company
has violated regulatory requirements applicable to storm water discharges, the government may
seek injunctive relief and penalties. The Company believes that it has defenses to any such
allegations. At this time, however, the Company can neither predict the outcome of this
inquiry, nor can it currently estimate the costs that may be associated with its eventual
resolution.

First Heights-related litigation

Pulte Homes, Inc. was a party to a lawsuit relating to First Heights’ 1988 acquisition from
the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (“FSLIC”) and First Heights’ ownership of
five failed Texas thrifts. The lawsuit was filed on December 26, 1996, in the United States
Court of Federal Claims (Washington, D.C.) by Pulte Homes, Inc., Pulte Diversified Companies,
Inc. and First Heights (collectively, the Pulte Parties) against the United States. The Pulte
Parties asserted breach of contract on the part of the United States in connection with the
enactment of Section 13224 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (“OBRA”). That
provision repealed portions of the tax benefits that the Pulte Parties claim they were entitled
to under the contract to acquire the failed Texas thrifts. The Pulte Parties also asserted
other claims concerning the contract, including that the United States (through the FDIC as
receiver) improperly attempted to amend the failed thrifts’ pre-acquisition tax returns and that
this attempt was made in an effort to deprive the Pulte Parties of tax benefits for which they
had contracted.

On August 17, 2001, the United States Court of Federal Claims ruled that the United States
government is liable to the Pulte Parties for breach of contract by enacting Section 13224 of
OBRA. In September 2003, the United States Court of Federal Claims issued final judgment that
the Pulte Parties had been damaged by approximately $48.7 million as a result of the United
States government’s breach of contract with them. The United States government and the Pulte
Parties appealed the final judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit in October 2003.

In August 2005, the Appeals Court affirmed the United States Court of Federal Claims
judgment, in its entirety. In December 2005, the Company received payment of the judgment in
the amount of $48.7 million, which was recorded as income from discontinued operations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Pulte Homes, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pulte Homes, Inc. (the
“Company”) as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Pulte Homes, Inc. at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Pulte Homes, Inc.’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated January 30, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

This Item is not applicable.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Management, including our President & Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President &
Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of December 31, 2005. Based upon, and as of the date of that evaluation,
our President & Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

(a) Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated
financial statements included in this annual report. The consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles and reflect
management’s judgments and estimates concerning events and transactions that are accounted for or
disclosed.

Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that pertain to the Company’s ability to record, process, summarize and
report reliable financial data. Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the
effectiveness of any internal control and effective internal control over financial reporting can
provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Additionally,
because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
may vary over time.

In order to ensure that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective,
management regularly assesses such controls and did so most recently for its financial reporting as
of December 31, 2005. Management’s assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control
over financial reporting described in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment,
management asserts that the Company has maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005.

Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the
Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, has issued an
attestation report on management’s assertion with respect to the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005.



Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (continued)

b) Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Pulte Homes, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Pulte Homes, Inc. maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Pulte Homes, Inc.’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Pulte Homes, Inc. maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Pulte Homes, Inc. maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Pulte Homes, Inc. as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’
equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2005 and our report dated January 30, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

(c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter
ended December 31, 2005 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
