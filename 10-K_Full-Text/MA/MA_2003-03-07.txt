MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

FISCAL YEAR 2002 FORM 10-K ANNUAL
REPORT


Item 1.

Business

MasterCard Incorporated is a leading global
payment solutions company that provides a variety of services
principally in support of our customers’ credit, deposit
access, electronic cash and related payment programs. We manage
a family of well-known, widely accepted payment card brands
including MasterCard®, Maestro® and Cirrus®,
which we license to our customers. We also provide our customers
with a sophisticated set of information and transaction
processing services and establish and enforce rules and
standards surrounding the use of cards carrying our brands.
Using our transaction processing services, our customers
facilitate payment transactions between cardholders and
merchants throughout the world, providing merchants with an
efficient and secure payment option, and consumers and
businesses with a convenient payment vehicle accepted worldwide.
In addition, we undertake a variety of marketing activities
designed to maintain and enhance the value of our brands. We
also work with our customers and other industry partners to
develop new technologies and applications for our payment
programs, particularly in the areas of electronic and mobile
commerce and chip-based “contact” and
“contactless” cards.

On a global scale, we process transactions
denominated in more than 160 currencies. In 2002, our gross
dollar volume (“GDV”) as reported by our customers was
$1.142 trillion, a 15% increase (on a local currency



basis) over the GDV generated in 2001. GDV
represents gross usage (purchase and cash disbursements) on
MasterCard-branded cards for goods and services, including
balance transfers and convenience checks. At December 31,
2002, the total number of MasterCard cards in circulation
worldwide as reported by our customers was 590.1 million, a
13.6% increase from 2001. These figures exclude Maestro, Cirrus
and Mondex® transactions. Our consolidated revenues were
$1.892 billion, $1.611 billion and $1.445 billion
for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. U.S. revenues were $1.159 billion,
$1.042 billion and $959 million for the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Because our business is global, we have
structured our organization to be sensitive to the requirements
of the regions and countries in which we operate. Our global
board of directors has delegated authority over a variety of
matters, including certain rulemaking, enforcement and
fee-setting decisions, to regional boards of directors covering
each of Asia/ Pacific, Canada, Europe, Latin America and the
Caribbean, South Asia – Middle East/ Africa
(“SAMEA”), and the United States. We enter into
business agreements with key customers around the globe, which
allow us to support the individual needs of these customers in
exchange for significant business commitments to MasterCard. At
the same time, we continue to provide best-in-class service to
all our customers, irrespective of their size.

We conduct our business through MasterCard
Incorporated’s principal operating subsidiary, MasterCard
International Incorporated (“MasterCard
International”), a Delaware membership corporation. The
principal members of MasterCard International and its affiliates
are approximately 2,300 financial institutions worldwide that
participate directly in our payment programs. In addition, there
are approximately 23,000 affiliate members of MasterCard
International and its affiliates that participate in our payment
programs through one or more principal members. Our customers
are our principal and affiliate members, which we refer to
collectively as our “customers” or
“members”. The common stock of MasterCard Incorporated
is owned by principal members of MasterCard International.

In Europe, we conduct our business principally
through MasterCard Europe sprl (“MasterCard Europe”),
formerly Europay International S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary
of MasterCard Incorporated acquired on June 28, 2002 in a
transaction that we refer to as the “Integration.” For
a description of the Integration and MasterCard’s related
conversion to a stock company, see Note 4 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.

We refer to the customers that issue our cards as
“issuers” and those that enroll merchants into
programs to accept our cards as “acquirers”. We use
the term “MasterCard” to refer to the MasterCard brand
generally and to the business conducted by MasterCard
Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including
MasterCard International and MasterCard Europe.

Payment Services

Transaction
Processing

Our transaction processing (primarily
authorization, clearing and settlement) services are provided to
customers through our proprietary, worldwide computer and
telecommunications network. We provide global transaction
processing services principally through our Global Technology
and Operations headquarters in O’Fallon, Missouri.

Authorization, Clearing and Settlement.

The authorization, clearing and
settlement process facilitates the movement of transaction data
and funds among customers on a global basis in a timely and
efficient manner.

Authorization is the process by which a
transaction is approved by the issuer or, in certain
circumstances, by MasterCard or others on behalf of the issuer
in accordance with the issuer’s instructions. We processed
over 7.6 billion MasterCard-branded authorizations on our global
processing systems in 2002. MasterCard’s authorization
network provides for the transmission of pertinent card account
data and authorization results among issuers, acquirers and
other transaction processors or networks. Our rules, which vary
across regions, establish the circumstances under which
merchants and acquirers must seek authorization of transactions.



Clearing is the exchange of financial transaction
information between the issuer and the acquirer after a
transaction has been completed. MasterCard transactions are
generally cleared through our centralized processing system,
known as the Global Clearing Management System (GCMS), and the
related information is typically routed among customers via our
Banknet data transport network.

Once transactions have been authorized and
cleared, MasterCard provides services in connection with the
settlement of the transaction—that is, the exchange of
funds along with associated fees. Settlement is provided through
our Settlement Account Management system (SAM). Once clearing is
completed, a daily reconciliation is provided to each customer
involved in settlement, detailing the net amounts by clearing
cycle and a final settlement position. The actual exchange of
funds takes place between a clearing bank chosen by the customer
and approved by MasterCard and one of MasterCard’s
settlement banks. Customer settlement occurs in U.S. dollars or
in other selected currencies, in accordance with established
rules.

We also operate the MasterCard Debit Switch
(“MDS”), which principally supports the processing of
Cirrus and Maestro transactions. The MDS switches financial
messages, provides transaction and statistical reporting and
performs clearing and settlement between customers and other
debit transaction processing networks. Unlike the authorization
and clearing processes described above, which involve the
exchange of transaction data in two discrete messages (one for
authorization and again for clearing), the MDS generally
operates as a “single message” system in which
clearing occurs simultaneously with the initial authorization
request.

A significant portion of the domestic (as opposed
to cross-border) transaction activity conducted with MasterCard,
Maestro and Cirrus cards is authorized, cleared and/or settled
by our customers or other processors without the involvement of
MasterCard’s central processing systems. We do not earn
transaction processing fees for such activity. We are developing
and promoting domestic processing solutions for our customers
that are designed to leverage our significant investments in our
global and regional processing systems.

Operations and Systems.

Our transaction processing services
are available 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. In the
event that our main processing facility in O’Fallon,
Missouri becomes disabled, we have a back-up system located at a
separate facility in Lake Success, New York. We expect to
migrate this back-up facility to Kansas City, Missouri during
2003. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included herein. Our transaction processing systems have
redundant power supplies and back-up processes to ensure
continued operation in the event of a fault. We consistently
maintain core systems availability for our global processing
systems at a rate in excess of 99.99%.

In 2002 we substantially completed our five-year
Systems Enhancement Strategy (“SES”), which was
designed to significantly upgrade our core global processing
systems to increase flexibility, achieve operating efficiencies
and improve time-to-market for new services. As part of the SES
program, among other things, we migrated our Banknet global data
transport network to a “virtual private network”
(“VPN”) in conjunction with AT&T. Our VPN
enhancements have significantly reduced transaction processing
times and enhanced data security for customers. We also
successfully introduced GCMS to replace our prior clearing
system, enhancing our processing flexibility, and through the
introduction of an Integrated Product Message (IPM) format,
enhanced our ability to support a richer set of transaction
data. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 98% of all
GCMS volume was being cleared using the new IPM format.

Regional Transaction
Processing.

Following the Integration,
we provide transaction processing (authorization, clearing and
settlement) services for customers in the Europe region through
our subsidiary MasterCard Europe. These services, which allow
European customers to facilitate payment transactions between
cardholders and merchants throughout Europe, are provided via
our European Payment Systems Network (“EPS-Net”).
EPS-Net is a telecommunications network that interfaces directly
with our global Banknet system for worldwide retail payment and
ATM transaction interchange. We are presently undertaking a
multi-year technical convergence project to fully integrate
EPS-Net with our global processing systems. In connection with
this initiative, we intend to integrate key applications and
systems and standardize formats to enhance customer service,
increase operating efficiencies and reduce processing costs. We
also operate a separate regional processing facility for the
Asia/ Pacific region in Australia.



Anti-Fraud
Initiatives

Our customers are principally responsible for
fraud losses associated with the cards they issue or the
merchants from whom they acquire transactions. However, we
develop programs and systems to aid our customers and merchants
in detecting and preventing the fraudulent use of cards carrying
our brands. We prepare, sell and distribute a “warning
bulletin” to customers showing invalid and other recently
terminated account numbers as identified by our customers. In
addition, our Member Protection Program provides, among other
things, a daily report to all card issuers identifying accounts
with unusual activity based on the number or size of
transactions.

We have a number of other prevention initiatives
targeted at fraudulent cardholder activity. As one example, our
System to Avoid Fraud Effectively (SAFE) program compiles
customer-submitted data regarding fraudulent transactions into
reports designed to help issuers and acquirers improve fraud
detection and prevention. In addition, our RiskFinder®
system helps customers to predict fraud and reduce losses by
evaluating transactions using a number of variables. We also
target fraudulent activity at the merchant level. For example,
through our Merchant Audit program, we identify high risk
merchants with significant fraud-related transaction activity
and encourage these merchants to implement fraud control
procedures. Our Member Alert to Control High-Risk
Merchants—MATCH program assists acquirers to assess risk
before signing a merchant into their MasterCard acceptance
programs and our Merchant Audit Program monitors merchants
worldwide once per month, assessing each merchant’s fraud
to sales ratio.

Security and cardholder authentication for remote
channels are critical issues facing MasterCard’s customers
and merchants who engage in electronic commerce transactions,
where a signed cardholder sales receipt is generally
unavailable. Disputed transactions resulting from “no
cardholder authorization” represent a substantial portion
of all disputed electronic commerce transactions processed
through the MasterCard network today. MasterCard is seeking to
address these issues through the implementation of MasterCard
SecureCode

TM

, a global Internet authentication
solution that permits cardholders to authenticate themselves to
their issuer through the use of a unique, personal code. In
addition, to help combat the security threats associated with
electronic commerce, MasterCard has developed the MasterCard
Site Data Protection Program. This program, which is available
through our acquirers, calls for e-commerce merchants and
service providers to assess their security situation on a
regular basis for potential vulnerabilities.

MasterCard RPPS

MasterCard’s Remote Payment and Presentment
Service (“RPPS”) is a leading processor of electronic
bill payments in the United States. RPPS provides routing,
editing, settlement and reconciliation services and also handles
electronic bill presentment (launched in 2000) and credit
counseling payments. RPPS has connections to most bill payment
service providers and approximately 425 credit counseling
agencies in the U.S. RPPS transmits over 19.5 million
payments per month.

Other Payment Related
Services

Our MasterCard Advisors group provides our
customers with a set of marketing, operations and technology
consulting; loyalty rewards and card enhancement services;
emergency service and fee-based service support; and
information-based performance analysis services. MasterCard
Advisors is planning to introduce new services in the areas of
expert and market research, customer relationship management and
database marketing, credit cycle management consulting, and
information technology consulting.

Within MasterCard Advisors, our marketing
consulting group provides customized consulting to customers in
the area of cardholder marketing, including acquisition,
portfolio management and loyalty consulting designed to help
expand our customers’ businesses. We consult with respect
to all MasterCard card programs, as well as other aspects of our
customers’ businesses, and in all regions of the world. Our
operations consultants provide advice principally in connection
with back-office processes, program management and change
management. We also provide consulting services to customers
regarding credit risk management activities.



Our Worldwide Cardholder Services group develops,
manages and markets a range of services to customers globally to
support the features that are offered in connection with certain
of our card programs, such as lost and stolen card reporting and
emergency card replacement services. In conjunction with
licensed insurance companies, we also support certain of our
customers’ purchase assurance, extended warranty, and
collision/damage waiver programs. In addition, our loyalty
rewards services group provides customers with comprehensive
support of their card-based loyalty rewards programs and
consulting on loyalty rewards programs globally.

We provide a set of software and online
decision-support tools to our customers and co-brand merchant
partners. Many of these tools rely on aggregated transaction
information captured in our clearing and settlement systems to
permit customers to analyze the performance of their card
portfolios. Many of our decision support tools are provided
through MasterCard

On

LiNE, our online customer access
system.

Brand Building

Marketing
Activities

We manage and promote the MasterCard brand for
the benefit of all customers through umbrella advertising,
promotional and sponsorship initiatives. We appeal to
cardholders to associate the MasterCard brand with “The
Best Way to Pay for Everything that Matters®”. Our
approach to marketing activities combines advertising,
sponsorships, promotions, interactive media and public relations
as part of an integrated package designed to increase consumer
awareness of MasterCard and to drive activation, usage and
retention of MasterCard cards. We also seek to tailor our global
marketing messages by optimizing their use in individual
countries, while maintaining a common global theme.

Advertising.

Our
advertising plays a critical role in building brand visibility,
usage and loyalty among cardholders globally. Our award-winning
“Priceless®” advertising campaign, launched in
the United States in 1997, has run in 45 languages across 96
countries. The “Priceless” campaign promotes
MasterCard’s universal acceptance and usage benefits that
permit cardholders to pay for what they need, when they need it.
It also provides MasterCard with a consistent, recognizable
message that supports our brand positioning.

Sponsorships.

We
seek to increase MasterCard brand awareness and preference, and
to encourage card usage and loyalty, by sponsoring a variety of
sporting and entertainment properties that support the
“Priceless” campaign and MasterCard brand positioning.
In soccer, MasterCard is the exclusive payment system sponsor of
the FIFA World Cup, which we believe is the single largest
sporting event in the world. We also sponsor other leading
soccer events, including the European Championship and UEFA
Champions League in Europe. In golf, we are an international
sponsor and the preferred card of the US PGA Tour, the Champions
Tour (previously the Senior PGA Tour), the PGA of America, the
LPGA, the British Open, the MasterCard Masters in Australia, and
the MasterCard Championship Tournament held in Hawaii.

In North America, in addition to golf, we have
major sports sponsorship investments in Major League Baseball
and ice hockey. In baseball, we are the exclusive payments brand
sponsor of Major League Baseball and a sponsor of both the MLB
All-Star Game and the World Series. We have also established
separate marketing and sponsorship arrangements with numerous
Major League Baseball teams. In hockey, we are the preferred
card and a sponsor of the National Hockey League, the National
Hockey League Players Association and the Canadian Hockey
League. We also sponsor a number of specific hockey-related and
skating events.

We sponsor a number of leading events in the
entertainment segment, including the BRIT Awards for the U.K.
music industry. In December 2002, as part of our marketing
strategy in family entertainment, we initiated a long-term
sponsorship arrangement with certain business units of Vivendi/
Universal that entitles MasterCard to marketing and promotional
programs with certain of Universal’s motion picture, theme
park, music, video and interactive properties. Through this
sponsorship arrangement, MasterCard will be the official payment
card of Universal and the exclusive brand for Universal
co-branded payment cards.

Promotions.

In order
to increase usage of our cards, we sponsor frequent promotions
on a regional and national basis, often in conjunction with
merchants or our customers. In the United States, we sponsor



MasterCard Exclusives

TM

, a collection
of promotional programs and select merchant offers that
customers can insert into their cardholder statements; and
MasterCard Exclusives Online®, a permission-based email and
Internet web site program providing cardholders with access to
exclusive merchant offers.

Merchant Acceptance
Initiatives

Based on information from our customers and other
sources, we estimate that, at December 31, 2002, cards
carrying MasterCard brands were accepted at over 30 million
locations and terminals around the world. These results are part
of a longer-term trend of substantially increasing MasterCard
card acceptance. In the area of acceptance, we aim to maintain
the unsurpassed acceptance of MasterCard-branded cards by
focusing on three core initiatives. First, we seek to increase
the number of payment channels where MasterCard cards are
accepted, such as by introducing MasterCard card acceptance in
connection with mobile commerce payment applications. Second, we
seek to increase the number of categories of merchants that
accept our cards. We are focused presently on expanding
acceptance in electronic commerce environments, fast food
restaurants and in connection with public sector payments
(including those in connection with taxes, fees, fines and
tolls), among other categories. Third, we seek to increase usage
of our cards at selected merchants by sponsoring a range of
promotional programs from time to time. We also enter into brand
preference agreements with merchants, in connection with which
merchants commit to expressing their preference for
MasterCard-branded cards when accepting payments from consumers.

We also support technical initiatives designed to
make card acceptance more attractive for specific merchants,
such as our Quick Payment Service for fast food restaurants and
other merchants where rapid transactions are required. In
December 2002, we initiated a market trial of MasterCard
PayPass

TM

, a new “contactless” radio
frequency chip solution that enables consumers simply to tap or
wave their payment card on a specially equipped terminal. For
merchants, MasterCard PayPass is designed to be simpler and
faster than cash, helping to speed consumers through the payment
process.

We view recurring payments as a significant
opportunity to expand MasterCard card acceptance and usage in
the United States and elsewhere, and we are working with
customers to encourage consumers to make recurring bill payments
in a variety of categories — including telephone, cable,
utilities and insurance – on their MasterCard-branded cards.

Co-branded/ Affinity
Cards

We provide research, marketing support and
financial assistance to our customers and their partners in
connection with the launch and marketing of co-branded and
affinity card programs. Co-branded cards are payment cards
bearing the logos or other insignia of an issuer and a marketing
partner, such as an airline or retail merchant. Affinity cards
are similar to co-branded cards except that the issuer’s
marketing partner is typically a charity, educational or similar
organization. MasterCard has supported a number of leading
co-branded and affinity card programs in the automobile, mass
merchandise retailing and travel segments.

MasterCard Payment Programs

MasterCard supports a wide range of payment
solutions to enable our customers to design, package and
implement programs targeted to the specific needs of their
customers. While we permit limited regional variations in the
characteristics and features of our payment programs, all
MasterCard cards benefit from the MasterCard worldwide
acceptance network and “honor all cards” rule, which
requires merchants accepting MasterCard to accept for payment
any validly presented MasterCard card. A MasterCard-branded card
can be used to make purchases or obtain cash wherever the
applicable brand logo is displayed indicating acceptance of the
card.



Our principal payment programs, which are
facilitated through our brands—MasterCard, Maestro, Cirrus
and Mondex—are listed below:

Consumer
Programs — Credit and Charge

MasterCard administers a number of consumer
credit and charge programs that are designed to meet the needs
of our customers for customized programs addressed to specific
consumer segments. Standard MasterCard cards are general purpose
credit cards targeted to consumers with basic needs for a credit
card. Gold MasterCard cards are targeted to consumers typically
requiring a higher line of credit or spending limit and one or
more card enhancement services associated with a card. Platinum
MasterCard® cards are generally targeted to more upscale
consumers and offered with still higher credit lines or spending
limits. Platinum MasterCard cards also provide a full range of
card enhancement services. World MasterCard cards have no preset
spending limit and the option to revolve a designated portion of
the charges made. These cards are targeted principally for
travel and entertainment use and are accompanied by
best-in-class enhancement services and loyalty rewards programs.

The services provided in connection with all
MasterCard credit cards include lost/stolen card reporting,
emergency card replacement and emergency cash advance.
MasterAssist® enhancement services are provided in
connection with most Gold, Platinum and World MasterCard cards,
as well as certain standard MasterCard cards, and include
emergency travel assistance and referral services, as well as
retail-related insurance such as purchase protection and
extended warranty coverage. MasterRental® vehicle rental
insurance is also provided in the United States in connection
with all Gold, Platinum and World MasterCard cards. Cardholders
can access these and other services through MasterCard Global
Service®, a worldwide customer service program. Required
services are generally provided through third party service
providers arranged by MasterCard, including a licensed insurance
company retained by MasterCard to provide insurance services.

Our rules also permit our issuers to issue
“secured” MasterCard cards, in which all or a portion
of the cardholder’s line of credit is secured by
collateral, and “virtual” MasterCard cards, which are
MasterCard-branded payment accounts against which an embossed
card is generally not issued.

MasterCard mc


cards are aimed at
technology-savvy young professionals and are generally
chip-enabled. To help support this new program, MasterCard has
developed a series of distinct card designs featuring
translucent plastic and a distinctive cutaway corner. MasterCard
is working with our customers to launch MasterCard
mc


programs in the Latin America/ Caribbean and
Asia/ Pacific regions.



MasterCard is in the process of launching a
number of programs in the consumer card segment. For example,
the MasterCard Family Account provides for a single, shared line
of credit that allows the primary cardholder to determine who
receives a card and the spending limits for each card. The
MasterCard Family Account allows our customers to leverage their
current loyalty programs, encourages families to concentrate
spending on a single account, and serves as a training tool for
young adults. The MasterCard Installment Card allows cardholders
more flexible access to pre-approved installment loans for large
purchases, and can be implemented by participating issuers in
more than one configuration.

Following the Integration, we are working with
our customers in Europe to migrate the Eurocard® acceptance
mark to MasterCard in a number of countries, including Germany.

Consumer
Programs — Deposit Access

MasterCard supports a range of payment solutions
that allow our customers to provide consumers with convenient
access to funds on deposit in checking, demand deposit and other
accounts through the MasterCard family of brands, including
MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus. MasterCard is working to develop
its debit programs in key countries. During 2002, the owners and
several members of Switch Card Services Limited, who operate an
electronic domestic debit card network in the United Kingdom
under the Switch® brand, signed contracts with MasterCard
Europe providing for the migration of Switch branding and
processing volume to the Maestro brand over a period of time. In
Brazil, MasterCard reached an agreement in 2002 to acquire
Redeshop®, a local debit brand.

Transactions processed on a debit card generally
withdraw available funds directly from a cardholder’s
account in accordance with terms established by the issuer of
the card, and in some cases may involve an extension of credit
by the issuer. Our deposit access programs may be branded with
the MasterCard, Maestro and/or Cirrus marks, and can be used to
obtain cash in bank branches or at automated teller machines
(“ATMs”). In addition, MasterCard-and Maestro-branded
debit cards may be used to make purchases at the point of sale.
MasterCard debit programs are designed to enhance our
customers’ programs and services by providing consumers
with greater access to their funds through our extensive global
point-of-sale acceptance network and the MasterCard ATM Network.
Debit cards carrying the MasterCard brand allow cardholders to
validate transactions at the point of sale either by signing a
sales receipt or, if the card also bears a Maestro or ATM
network mark and the merchant has the necessary terminal, by
entering a personal identification number (“PIN”) at a
terminal. Like our consumer credit programs, we support debit
Gold MasterCard programs and debit Platinum MasterCard programs
that issuers can offer as premium services to cardholders.
Issuers may also provide enhancement services and loyalty
rewards programs in connection with debit cards carrying our
brands. In the United States, all MasterCard debit cards benefit
from the same core enhancements available on MasterCard credit
cards.

Maestro is MasterCard’s online, PIN-based
global debit program. Typically, Maestro cards allow cardholders
to verify their identities by entering a PIN, although in
certain countries, cardholders are required to sign a sales
receipt. Maestro cards are issued, and Maestro transactions are
processed, pursuant to a set of rules and procedures that are
separate from the rules applicable to MasterCard credit and
debit transactions. International travel and other services,
including emergency cash disbursement and lost and stolen card
reporting, are available on an optional basis to Maestro
cardholders through Maestro Global Service from MasterCard.
Based on information from our customers and other sources, we
estimate that, at December 31, 2002, the Maestro brand mark
appeared on approximately 505 million cards worldwide and
that Maestro was accepted for purchases at more than
7.2 million merchant terminals.

The MasterCard ATM Network is among the
world’s largest global ATM networks, with more than 820,000
participating cash dispensing locations around the globe.
Generally, cardholders with cards bearing the MasterCard,
Maestro or Cirrus logo may use a network ATM to access funds on
deposit in their accounts or to obtain a cash advance (if a
MasterCard credit card is used).

We make the Cirrus brand available to customers
to provide global cash access through the MasterCard ATM Network
for our customers’ proprietary ATM cards. Cirrus
transactions are validated by entering a



PIN. Cirrus cards are issued and processed
pursuant to a set of rules and procedures applicable
specifically to ATM transactions.

Corporate Payment
Solutions

MasterCard’s corporate payment solutions
assist corporations, mid-sized companies, small businesses and
public sector organizations in streamlining their payment
processes, managing information and reducing administrative
costs.

The MasterCard Corporate Card is designed to
allow organizations to manage employee travel and entertainment
expenses. MasterCard Corporate Executive Cards, marketed in such
countries as the United States, Canada, Chile and France, are
targeted at senior executives and offer increased spending
limits, concierge services and worldwide, 24-hour customer
service. MasterCard Corporate Purchasing Cards, marketed
globally, are designed to assist in the corporate purchasing
process and provide companies with access to enhanced line item
transaction detail. MasterCard Corporate Fleet Cards provide
companies with a way to monitor and control the expenses of a
commercial fleet at the vehicle or driver level, as well as to
capture and manage detailed spending data. Finally, the
MasterCard Corporate Multi Card is an integrated card program
that combines the functionality of one or more of our MasterCard
corporate programs—travel, purchasing and fleet—into a
single card or account, thereby reducing the costs of managing
multiple card programs. We also administer a variety of payment
programs for public sector entities that are similar to the
travel, purchasing, fleet and Multi cards offered to
corporations.

The MasterCard BusinessCard and Executive
BusinessCard are targeted at the small-business segment,
offering business owners the ability to extend payments and
separate business expenses from personal expenses. Currently
available in the United States and Europe, MasterCard
Working

TM

is a comprehensive set of small business
payment solutions for business owners. The Working program
includes multiple card programs; savings, through MasterCard
Exclusives Online, and rewards, through MasterCard Business
Bonuses; and the Resource Center, which provides small
businesses with news, advice, research and other tools.

MasterCard Smart Data Online, our web-based
reporting tool, is available in twelve languages and allows
organizations ranging from small businesses to large
multinational corporations to display cardholder statements,
prepare management reports and integrate charge data into their
financial systems. To target electronic business-to-business
transactions, we have developed MasterCard
SmartLink

TM

, which is designed to integrate certain
enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) systems with the
MasterCard Corporate Purchasing Card so that transactional data
generated at any point of purchase worldwide by a company’s
employees can be automatically downloaded.

Stored Value
Programs

Stored value programs involve a balance account
that is funded with monetary value prior to use. The account may
be in the form of a traditional magnetic stripe or chip-enabled
payment card (prepaid cards), paper (travelers cheques), or an
electronic “purse” card (Mondex).

Prepaid.

MasterCard’s prepaid card
platform is a flexible tool that permits our customers to
develop, launch and manage host-based, magnetic stripe-enabled
prepaid card programs customized to the needs of unique consumer
segments – including gift cards, teen cards, employee
benefit cards, etc. There are a variety of MasterCard-branded
prepaid card programs in operation in the United States, Asia/
Pacific and other regions.

Travelers Cheques.

Travelers cheques are a paper-based,
prepaid form of payment for use at the point of sale.
MasterCard-branded travelers cheques, which are available in a
number of international currencies, are refundable worldwide and
can be replaced if lost or stolen. MasterCard-branded travelers
cheques are issued by a number of customers around the world.
For a description of our guarantee obligations relating to
travelers cheques, see Note 15 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included herein.



Mondex.

The Mondex
electronic cash program, a chip-based, stored value payment
application, allows monetary value to be stored in an electronic
“purse” directly on Mondex-branded payment cards. The
Mondex purse application has been franchised, principally to
financial institutions, in several major national markets.
Mondex cards permit the immediate transfer of value to a
merchant or between cards without the transaction being
authorized, cleared or settled through a central computer
system. The Mondex purse application is commercialized through a
franchise system operated by Mondex International Limited
(“MXI”), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
MasterCard International.

Global e-Business and Emerging
Technologies

MasterCard is supporting innovation in the
payments industry with a number of initiatives, including
developments in the areas of electronic commerce, electronic
business-to-business (eB2B), smart cards and mobile commerce.

Electronic Commerce and eB2B.

MasterCard’s Electronic Commerce
and Electronic Business-to-Business Center of Excellence, based
in our Purchase, New York global headquarters, was established
in 2001 to manage MasterCard’s electronic commerce
offerings. This team seeks to ensure that MasterCard-branded
consumer and corporate payment cards play an important role in
payment channels that are developing as a result of the
continued evolution of the Internet. The team also identifies,
tests and develops a range of emerging technologies that offer
new business opportunities to MasterCard and our customers.
MasterCard’s eB2B initiative is focused on providing our
customers with flexible options rather than a single proprietary
solution. In 2002, we integrated MasterCard payment solutions
across a number of vendors and platforms.

Smart Cards and Mobile Commerce.

MasterCard’s Chip and Mobile
Commerce Center of Excellence, based in Waterloo, Belgium, was
established in 2002 to manage smart cards and mobile/wireless
development for MasterCard.

In the area of smart cards, we currently are
working with our customers to help them replace traditional
payment cards relying solely on magnetic stripe technology with
chip-enabled payment cards. MasterCard has played a significant
role in the implementation of smart card technology. As of
December 31, 2002, more than 126 million smart cards
bearing MasterCard’s brands were issued worldwide. Today,
more than 200 customers have either issued or are implementing
chip-based credit or debit cards in countries across the globe,
including Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy,
Korea, Taiwan, Brazil, Mexico and South Africa.

In April 2002, MasterCard introduced

“One

SMART MasterCard,” a flexible and
customized approach to smart cards that provides our customers
with support in the areas needed to launch a successful smart
card program. The MasterCard Compliance Assessment and Security
Training (CAST) program helps customers evaluate the
security and risk of smart cards, including chip hardware,
operating systems platforms, and payment and non-payment
applications implemented on cards carrying our brands.

We are a member of GlobalPlatform, a
cross-industry organization to develop, manage and promote a
standardized framework for multiple application smart cards.
MasterCard played an important role in the development and
deployment of MULTOS, the first open, high-security,
multi-application operating system for smart cards. MasterCard
continues to actively support all major smart card environments
(MULTOS, JavaCard, and proprietary platforms).

In the area of mobile commerce, MasterCard is
working to develop standards and programs that will allow
consumers to conduct their financial transactions securely using
a variety of wireless devices. Our global mobile commerce team
works with standards organizations to establish reliable, secure
wireless payment standards. MasterCard is a founding member and
leader of the Mobile Payment Forum, established in 2001 as a
cross-industry group dedicated to enabling secure, user-friendly
mobile payment transactions. As the use of cellular phone
service continues to grow around the world, MasterCard is
working to develop a solution for providing prepaid airtime
payments using payment cards. MasterCard is also focused on
development initiatives in the areas of radio frequency and
proximity payments. For a description of the MasterCard PayPass
program, see “—Brand Building—Merchant Acceptance
Initiatives.”



Membership Standards

Rule Making and
Enforcement

The stockholders of MasterCard Incorporated are
principal members of MasterCard International. Membership in
MasterCard International and its affiliates is open to banks and
other regulated and supervised financial institutions.
Applicants for membership must meet membership eligibility
requirements and must be approved by the appropriate regional
MasterCard board of directors. In general, MasterCard staff
grants licenses by territory. To be approved as a member, an
applicant must be able to perform all obligations required of
members. Risk management reviews and money laundering due
diligence reviews are conducted on all new members prior to
admission, and are updated from time to time. Licenses for
MasterCard-branded payment programs are granted by MasterCard
International, except in Europe where MasterCard Europe acts as
MasterCard International’s licensing agent. Licenses for
Cirrus- and Maestro-branded programs are generally granted by
the MasterCard affiliates responsible for these brands.

As a condition of membership and licenses to use
our brands, members agree to comply with our by laws, policies,
rules and operating regulations in effect from time to time
(“Standards”). MasterCard International and certain of
its affiliates are the governing bodies that establish and
enforce the Standards. The Standards relate to such matters as
membership eligibility and financial soundness criteria; the
standards, design and features of cards and card programs; the
use of MasterCard trademarks; merchant acquiring activities
(including acceptance standards applicable to merchants); and
guaranteed settlement, member failures and allocation of losses.

To help ensure that members conform to the
Standards, we run a number of compliance programs including
reviewing card programs proposed to be issued by members and
requiring members to undergo an annual audit by an independent
certified public accountant (or similar examination by a
regulatory authority). To tailor MasterCard’s programs and
services to the needs of local markets, our global and/or
regional boards have approved a number of variations to the
Standards applicable to specific regions. In 2002, in connection
with the integration transaction, the rules and regulations
previously managed by Europay International S.A. for the
MasterCard brand were incorporated into MasterCard’s global
Standards with appropriate variations for that region.

Member Risk
Management

As a secondary obligor for certain card
obligations of principal members, we are exposed to member
credit risk arising from the potential failure of any of our
approximately 2,300 principal members of MasterCard, Maestro and
Cirrus, and approximately 2,600 affiliate debit licensees.
Principal members participate directly in MasterCard programs
and are responsible for the settlement and other activities of
their sponsored affiliate members (numbering approximately
23,000 in total). Principal members and affiliate debit
licensees that do not meet MasterCard’s credit risk
standards may be required to provide MasterCard with collateral,
such as standby letters of credit or cash deposits, when deemed
necessary by management.

To minimize the contingent risk to MasterCard of
a failure, we monitor principal members’ and affiliate
debit licensees’ financial health, economic operating
environments and compliance with our rules and standards. If the
financial condition of a member or the state of a national
economy in which a member operates indicates that a member may
not be able to satisfy its MasterCard settlement obligations to
other members or its payment obligations to MasterCard
merchants, we may require the member to post collateral
sufficient to cover the potential exposure in the event of such
member’s failure. If an issuing bank is potentially unable
to meet its obligations to us, we can block authorization and
settlement of transactions and ultimately terminate membership.

For liquidity protection in the event of member
settlement failure, we have established a $1.2 billion
committed credit facility, which is subject to annual renewal.
In addition, we have the right to assess all or a portion of our
members for reimbursement for settlement losses, member credit
losses or any other operating losses, subject to certain
limitations set forth in the bylaws and other Standards of
MasterCard Incorporated.



For a description of our exposure to settlement
and travelers’ cheque risk, see Note 15 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included herein.

Intellectual Property

We own a number of valuable trademarks that are
essential to our business, including MasterCard®,
Maestro® and Cirrus®, through one or more affiliates.
We also own numerous other trademarks covering various brands,
programs and services offered by MasterCard to support our
payment programs. Through license agreements with our customers,
we authorize the use of our trademarks in connection with our
customers’ card issuing and merchant acquiring businesses.
Trademarks remain valid so long as they are used properly for
identification purposes, and we emphasize the correct use of our
trademarks both within our company and by our members. In
addition, we own a number of patents relating to payments
solutions, transaction processing, smart cards, security systems
and other matters. None of our patents is material to our
business operations.

Competition

MasterCard programs compete against all forms of
payment, including paper-based transactions (principally cash
and checks) and electronic transactions such as wire transfers
and Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) payments. While
we have gained share versus cash and checks in recent years,
these forms of payment still capture the largest overall
percentage of worldwide transaction volume. Within the global
general purpose card industry, we believe that Visa may have
approximately twice our volume. In certain countries, other
competitors also have leading positions, such as JCB in Japan.

The most common card-based forms of payment are
general purpose cards, which are payment cards carrying logos
that permit widespread usage of the cards within countries,
regions or around the world. General purpose cards may be
credit, charge or deposit access cards. Within the general
purpose payment card industry, we face substantial and
increasingly intense competition worldwide from systems such as
Visa (including Plus, Electron and Interlink), American Express,
JCB, Diners Club and Carte Blanche, among others. In specific
countries, we face significant competition from other
competitors such as Discover/ Novus (United States), Interac
(Canada) and Bankcard and EFTPOS (Australia). We also encounter
competition from businesses such as retail stores and petroleum
(gasoline) companies that issue their own payment cards, as
well as from ATM/point-of-sale networks such as FDC/ NYCE,
Concord/ EFS (Star), PULSE and others. Some of our competitors
have substantially greater capital and resources than we have.

Our competitors include operators of proprietary
end-to-end payment networks that have direct acquiring
relationships with merchants and direct issuing relationships
with cardholders, such as American Express. These competitors
have certain advantages that we do not enjoy. Through MasterCard
International, the MasterCard business is structured as an open
bankcard association, in which cardholder and merchant
relationships are managed principally by our customers.
Accordingly, in addition to proprietary end-to-end networks, we
compete intensely with other bankcard associations, principally
Visa, for the loyalty of our customers. In most countries
throughout the world, including the United States, financial
institutions typically issue both MasterCard- and Visa-branded
payment cards. As a result of this structure, known as
“duality”, we compete with Visa for business on the
basis of individual card portfolios or programs. In some
countries, particularly Canada, card issuers are
“non-dual”, meaning that they issue either MasterCard
or Visa payment cards, but not both. Issuance of MasterCard and
Visa debit cards is generally non-dual in the United States as
well. In non-dual countries, we compete with Visa for the entire
book of a customer’s business. Significant ongoing
consolidation in the banking industry may result in a financial
institution with a substantial MasterCard portfolio being
acquired by an institution that has a strong relationship with
Visa, resulting in the loss of business for MasterCard.

We also compete against new entrants that have
developed alternative payment systems. Among other things, these
competitors provide Internet currencies that can be used to buy
and sell goods on-line, “virtual checking” programs
that permit the direct debit of consumer checking accounts for
on-line payments, and services that support payments to and from
proprietary accounts for Internet, mobile commerce and other



applications. A number of these new entrants rely
principally on the Internet to support their services, and may
enjoy lower costs than we do.

We face competition from transaction processors
such as First Data Corporation, some of which are seeking to
build networks that link issuers directly with point-of-sale
devices for payment card transaction authorization and
processing services. These networks could reduce our transaction
processing volumes.

In mobile commerce, we face competition from
established network operators, who today manage millions of
consumer relationships and possess key advantages for
facilitating payments across mobile devices. Whereas the
MasterCard approach to mobile commerce centers on the use of the
consumer’s payment account as established by their card
issuer, network operators may apply mobile consumer payments
directly to the customer’s monthly bill.

We believe that the principal factors affecting
our competitive position in the global payments industry are:

Government Regulation

MasterCard is subject to a variety of employment,
health and safety, environmental and other forms of government
regulation in the ordinary course of its business. MasterCard
customers are subject to numerous regulations applicable to
banks and other financial institutions in the United States and
elsewhere, and as a consequence MasterCard is at times impacted
by such regulations. Certain of MasterCard’s operations are
subject to periodic audits by the Federal Financial Institutions
Examination Council. In addition, aspects of our operations or
business may be subject to privacy regulation in the United
States, the European Union and elsewhere, as well as regulations
imposed by the U.S. Office of Foreign Asset Control.

Our subsidiary MasterCard Europe operates a
retail payment system in Europe and, effective in 2003, is
subject to oversight by the National Bank of Belgium
(“NBB”) pursuant to standards published by the
European Central Bank. The NBB’s oversight of MasterCard
Europe is principally addressed at managing financial, legal and
operations risk. It will take the form of routine contacts
between MasterCard Europe and the NBB, an exchange of
information/statistical reporting and an obligation on the part
of MasterCard Europe to report any major incidents in the areas
of settlement, network infrastructure and fraud to the NBB.

In 2002, participants in the payment industry,
including MasterCard, became subject to the regulatory
requirements of Section 352(a) of the Uniting and
Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to
Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “USA
PATRIOT Act”). The USA PATRIOT Act has required MasterCard
to create and implement a comprehensive anti-money laundering
program, and has imposed similar requirements on our customers.

Except as stated above or in the description of
legal proceedings contained in Note 14 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included herein, government regulation did
not have a material impact on MasterCard in 2002, and MasterCard
does not expect that government regulation will have a material
impact on its business or financial condition in 2003.



Employees

As of December 31, 2002, we employed
approximately 4,000 persons, of which approximately 1,300 were
employed outside the United States. We consider our relationship
with our employees to be good.

SEC Reports

Our periodic reports filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission are available for review on
our website at www.mastercardintl.com.

Risk Factors

If we are unable to maintain our
relationships with our customers, or if our customers are unable
to maintain their relationships with cardholders or with the
merchants who accept our cards for payment, our business may be
adversely affected.

We are and will continue to be significantly
dependent on a number of relationships with other parties,
principally our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and
their further relationships with cardholders and merchants, to
support our programs and services. Most of our relationships
with our customers are not exclusive and may be terminated at
the convenience of our customers. We cannot assure you that our
customers will not reassess their commitments to us at any time
in the future or that they will not develop their own
competitive services. In particular, the payments industry is
currently undergoing significant consolidations and the merger
of one or more of our customers with financial institutions
aligned with our competitors could have a material adverse
impact on our business and prospects.

Our business strategy calls for us to increase
our share by, among other things, entering into business
agreements with customers around the globe. Like our other
customer relationships, these agreements are terminable by our
customers in a variety of circumstances. Examples of provisions
appearing in various agreements currently in effect that may
permit a customer to terminate its agreement include:

•

certain customers receiving more than one seat on
    a board of directors while others do not;

•

increasing the limit on voting rights of a
    customer to more than 25%; or

•

failing to elect certain persons to a MasterCard
    board (e.g., a stockholder holding more than 5% of MasterCard
    Incorporated common stock is entitled to cancel its business
    agreement if one of its employees does not have a board seat).

A number of our key customers are represented on
our board of directors. If any one of these customers were to
lose its representation on the board, this could have a
detrimental effect on our business relationship with that
customer. Conversely, a number of customers that make
substantial contributions to our revenues, including Bank One
Delaware, N.A., are principally aligned with one of our
competitors. A significant loss of revenues or transaction
volumes from these customers could have an adverse impact on our
business.

In addition, we may be required to permit issuers
with which we have entered into business agreements in the
United States to terminate those agreements without penalty as a
result of the antitrust litigation currently on appeal that was
brought against us by the United States Department of Justice,
which is described in a separate risk factor below. Accordingly,
our business agreements with customers may not reduce the risk
inherent in our business that customers may terminate their
relationships with us in favor of our competitors, or for other
reasons, or might not meet their contractual obligations to us.

We do not issue cards, set cardholder fees or
determine the interest rates (if applicable) charged to
cardholders using cards that carry our brands. Each MasterCard
issuer is responsible for determining these and most other
competitive card features. In addition, we do not solicit
merchants to process transactions or establish the discount rate
that merchants are charged for card acceptance, which are
responsibilities of our acquirers. As a result, much of our
business depends on the continued success and competitiveness of
our customers. In turn, our customers’ success is dependent
upon a variety of factors over which we have little or



no influence. If our customers become financially
unstable, we may lose the revenue that we generate by charging
them operations fees and assessments, or we may be exposed to
settlement risk as described below.

We rely on the continuing expansion of merchant
acceptance of our brands of cards. Although it is our business
strategy to invest in strengthening our brands and expanding our
acceptance network, there can be no guarantee that our efforts
in these areas will continue to be successful. If the rate of
merchant acceptance growth slows or reverses itself, our
business could suffer.

Our operating results may suffer because of
substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in
the global payments industry.

The global payments industry is highly
competitive. We compete with all forms of payment including
cash, checks and electronic forms of payment. Among general
purpose payment cards, we encounter constant and intense
competition from systems such as Visa and its related brands
(including Plus, Electron and Interlink), American Express, JCB,
Diners Club and Carte Blanche. In specific countries, we face
significant competition from other competitors such as Discover/
Novus, Interac, Bankcard and EFTPOS. We also encounter
competition from businesses such as retail stores and petroleum
(gasoline) companies that issue their own private-label
cards, as well as from ATM/point-of-sale networks such as FDC/
NYCE, Concord/ EFS (Star), PULSE and others. We also compete
against new entrants that have developed alternative payment
systems that can compete effectively with MasterCard for payment
transactions and volume. In mobile commerce, we compete against
established network operators that possess key advantages for
facilitating payments across mobile devices.

Some of our competitors have developed, or may
develop, substantially greater financial and other resources
than we have, may offer a wider range of programs and services
than we offer or may use more effective advertising and
marketing strategies to achieve broader brand recognition or
merchant acceptance than we have. Within the global general
purpose card industry, we believe that Visa may have
approximately twice our purchase volume. In certain countries
other of our competitors have leading positions, such as JCB in
Japan. In addition, American Express, Discover/ Novus and others
control proprietary end-to-end payment systems in which they
extend payment privileges to consumers and businesses and
establish transaction processing relationships directly with
merchants (in our case, both of these functions are the
responsibility of our customers). These end-to-end systems
provide our competitors with certain competitive advantages that
we do not enjoy. We may not continue to be able to compete
effectively against these threats, and, as a result, our
revenues or income may decline.

Over the last several years, the banking industry
has undergone rapid consolidation, and we expect this trend to
continue in the future. Consolidation represents a competitive
threat for MasterCard because our business strategy contemplates
entering into business agreements with our largest customers in
exchange for significant business commitments to MasterCard.
Accordingly, the merger of one or more of our significant
customers with financial institutions that have strong
relationships with our competitors could have a material adverse
impact on our business and prospects. In addition, one or more
of our customers could seek to merge with, or acquire, one of
our competitors, and any such transaction could have a material
adverse impact on our business and prospects.

We also face competition from transaction
processors such as First Data Corporation, some of whom are
seeking to build networks that link issuers directly with
point-of-sale devices for payment card transaction authorization
and processing services. These networks could reduce our own
transaction processing volumes, which could have a material
adverse impact on our revenues.

In addition, our business and revenues could be
impacted adversely by any tendency among U.S. consumers or
financial institutions to migrate from off-line, signature based
debit transactions to on-line, PIN-based transactions, because
the latter types of transactions are more likely to be processed
by ATM/point-of-sale networks as opposed to ourselves.



Global economic and political conditions
may adversely affect our revenues.

The global payments industry is heavily dependent
upon the overall level of consumer spending. A sustained
deterioration in general economic conditions, particularly in
the United States or Europe, or increases in interest rates in
key countries in which we operate, may adversely affect our
financial performance by reducing the number or average ticket
size of transactions involving payment cards carrying our
brands. In addition, a significant portion of the volume
generated on cards carrying our brands is associated with
cross-border business and leisure travel, which may be adversely
affected by world geopolitical conditions.

If we are not able to keep pace with the
rapid technological developments in our industry to provide
customers, merchants and cardholders with new and innovative
payment programs and services, the use of MasterCard-branded
cards could decline, which would reduce our revenues and
income.

The payment card industry is subject to rapid and
significant technological changes, such as continuing
developments of technologies in the areas of smart cards, radio
frequency and proximity payment devices, electronic commerce and
mobile commerce, among others. We cannot predict the effect of
technological changes on our business. We rely in part on third
parties, including some of our competitors and potential
competitors, for the development of and access to new
technologies. We expect that new services and technologies
applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge, and
these new services and technologies may be superior to or render
obsolete the technologies we currently use in our card programs
and services. Our future success will depend, in part, on our
ability to develop or adapt to technological changes and
evolving industry standards and to provide end-to-end payment
solutions for our customers.

In many circumstances we believe that the payment
card industry should create, and we are working to forge,
industry standards to allow for the compatibility of various
card programs and technologies. The industry, however, may not
set standards on a timely basis or at all, or we may develop a
program or technology that is not adapted as an industry
standard. These risks could have a material adverse effect on
our revenues and income.

If our transaction processing systems are
disrupted or we are unable to process transactions securely,
efficiently or at all, our revenues or income would be
materially reduced.

Our transaction authorization, clearing and
settlement systems may experience service interruptions as a
result of fire, natural disasters, power loss, disruptions in
long distance or local telecommunications access, terrorism or
accident. Most of our transaction processing systems are
operated out of a single facility, supported by a separate
back-up facility. A natural disaster or other problem at our
primary and/or back-up facilities or our other owned or leased
facilities could interrupt our services. Additionally, we rely
on third-party service providers, such as AT&T, for the
timely transmission of information across our global data
transportation network. If a service provider fails to provide
the communications capacity or services we require, as a result
of natural disaster, operational disruption, terrorism or any
other reason, the failure could interrupt our services and
adversely affect the perception of our brands’ reliability
and our revenues or income.

In addition, our security protection measures,
including with respect to the security of transaction
information processed on our systems or the systems or
processing technology of third parties participating in our
network, may not be sufficient to prevent the fraudulent or
other improper use of cards carrying our brands. Unauthorized
use of our network potentially could jeopardize the security of
confidential information stored in our computer systems or
transmitted by our customers or others. These factors may result
in liabilities for us or our customers, and could reduce our
revenues and income.

In every MasterCard card transaction, there
is a risk that the issuer or acquirer will default in its
payment obligations. Because we are a secondary obligor for
certain card obligations among principal members, one or more
defaults could expose us to significant losses.

As a secondary obligor for certain card
obligations among principal members, we are exposed to
settlement risk from our members. Settlement exposure
materializes when an issuer or acquirer fails to fund daily
settlement obligations due to technical reasons, liquidity
shortfall or other reasons. For any member, our settlement
exposure is comprised of the estimated dollar value of issuing
and chargeback transactions that we would need to fund in order
to satisfy the member’s MasterCard, Maestro or
Cirrus-related obligations to other members. If a principal
member is unable to fulfill its settlement obligations to other
members, we may



bear the loss, even if we do not otherwise
process the transaction. In addition, although we are not
contractually obligated to do so, we may elect to keep merchants
whole in the event that an acquirer defaults on its merchant
payment obligations, in order to maintain the integrity and
acceptance of our brands. Accordingly, one or more member
defaults could expose us to significant losses and reduce our
net income.

The continuation of negative economic conditions
in 2002 has caused significant increases in consumer
bankruptcies and write-offs of consumer credit card loans by
members. These conditions have caused the credit quality of
certain members to deteriorate in turn, including in the United
States, Argentina and Brazil. In other countries, such as Japan
and Turkey, the banking system as a whole has been the subject
of declining credit quality. Any decrease in the credit quality
of a member would increase the risk of member default, which, as
noted above, could expose us to significant losses and reduce
our net income. In the alternative, credit quality issues could
cause certain of our members to reduce the scope of their
businesses or exit the payment card business entirely, which
could negatively impact our revenues.

MasterCard cannot predict the outcome or
impact of antitrust claims by the U.S. Department of
Justice.

In October 1998, the United States Department of
Justice (“DOJ”) filed suit against MasterCard
International, Visa U.S.A., Inc. and Visa International Corp. in
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York
alleging that both MasterCard’s and Visa’s governance
structure and policies violated U.S. federal antitrust laws.
First, the DOJ claimed that “dual governance” —
the situation where a financial institution has a representative
on the board of directors of MasterCard or Visa while a portion
of its card portfolio is issued under the brand of the other
association — was anti-competitive and acted to limit
innovation within the payment card industry. At the same time,
the DOJ conceded that “dual issuance” — a term
describing the structure of the bank card industry in the United
States in which a single financial institution can issue both
MasterCard and Visa-branded cards — was pro-competitive.
Second, the DOJ challenged MasterCard’s Competitive
Programs Policy (“CPP”) and a Visa bylaw provision
that prohibit financial institutions participating in the
respective associations from issuing competing proprietary
payment cards (such as American Express or Discover). The DOJ
alleged that MasterCard’s CPP and Visa’s bylaw
provision acted to restrain competition.

MasterCard denied the DOJ’s allegations.
MasterCard believes that both “dual governance” and
the CPP are pro-competitive and fully consistent with U.S.
federal antitrust law.

A bench trial concerning the DOJ’s
allegations was concluded on August 22, 2000. On
October 9, 2001, the district court judge issued an opinion
upholding the legality and pro-competitive nature of dual
governance. In so doing, the judge specifically found that
MasterCard and Visa have competed vigorously over the years,
that prices to consumers have dropped dramatically, and that
MasterCard has fostered rapid innovations in systems, product
offerings and services.

However, the judge also held that
MasterCard’s CPP and the Visa bylaw constitute unlawful
restraints of trade under the federal antitrust laws. The judge
found that the CPP and Visa bylaw weakened competition and
harmed consumers by preventing competing proprietary payment
card networks such as American Express and Discover from
entering into agreements with banks to issue cards on their
networks. In reaching this decision, the judge found that two
distinct markets — a credit and charge card issuing market
and a network services market — existed in the United
States, and that both MasterCard and Visa had market power in
the network market. MasterCard strongly disputes these findings
and believes that the DOJ failed, among other things, to
demonstrate that U.S. consumers have been harmed by the CPP.

On November 26, 2001, the judge issued a
final judgment that orders MasterCard to repeal the CPP insofar
as it applies to issuers and enjoins MasterCard from enacting or
enforcing any bylaw, rule, policy or practice that prohibits its
issuers from issuing general purpose credit or debit cards in
the United States on any other general purpose card network. The
judge also concluded that during the period in which the CPP was
in effect, MasterCard was able to “lock up” certain
members by entering into long-term agreements with them pursuant
to which the members committed to maintain a certain percentage
of their general purpose card volume, new card issuance or total
number of cards in force in the United States on
MasterCard’s network. Accordingly, the final judgment
provides that there will be a period (commencing on the
effective date of the



judgment and ending on the later of two years
from that date or two years from the resolution of any final
appeal) during which MasterCard will be required to permit any
issuer with which it entered into such an agreement prior to the
effective date of the final judgment to terminate that agreement
without penalty, provided that the reason for the termination is
to permit the issuer to enter into an agreement with American
Express or Discover. MasterCard would be free to apply to the
district court to recover funds paid but not yet earned under
any terminated agreement. The final judgment imposes parallel
requirements on Visa. The judge explicitly provided that
MasterCard and Visa would be free to enter into new partnership
or member business agreements in the future.

MasterCard believes that it has a strong legal
basis to challenge the judge’s ruling with respect to the
CPP, and has appealed the decision on that count. On
February 6, 2002, the judge issued an order granting
MasterCard’s and Visa’s motion to stay the final
judgment pending appeal. MasterCard, the DOJ and other parties
to the DOJ antitrust litigation completed their submission of
appellate briefs to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in late
August 2002, and presently are awaiting a date for oral argument
on the appeal of the U.S. District Court’s decision in this
case. MasterCard believes that it is not currently possible to
estimate the impact, if any, that the ultimate resolution of
this matter will have on MasterCard’s results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.

MasterCard cannot predict the outcome or
impact of a class action lawsuit by U.S. merchants against
MasterCard.

Commencing in October 1996, several class action
suits were brought by a number of U.S. merchants —
including Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Sears Roebuck & Co., Inc.,
The Limited Inc. and Safeway, Inc. — against MasterCard
International and Visa U.S.A., Inc. challenging certain aspects
of the payment card industry under U.S. federal antitrust law.
Those suits were later consolidated in the U.S. District Court
for the Eastern District of New York. The plaintiffs challenge
MasterCard’s “Honor All Cards” rule (and a
similar Visa rule), which ensures universal acceptance for
consumers by requiring merchants who accept MasterCard cards to
accept for payment every validly presented MasterCard card.
Plaintiffs claim that MasterCard and Visa unlawfully have tied
acceptance of debit cards to acceptance of credit cards. In
essence, the merchants desire the ability to reject off-line,
signature-based debit transactions (for example, MasterCard card
transactions) in favor of other payment forms, including
on-line, PIN-based debit transactions (for example, Maestro or
regional ATM network transactions) which generally impose lower
transaction costs for merchants. The plaintiffs also claim that
MasterCard and Visa have conspired to monopolize what they
characterize as the point-of-sale debit card market, thereby
suppressing the growth of regional networks such as ATM payment
systems. Plaintiffs allege that the plaintiff class has been
forced to pay unlawfully high prices for debit and credit card
transactions as a result of the alleged tying arrangement and
monopolization practices. There are related consumer class
actions pending in two state courts that have been stayed
pending developments in this matter.

MasterCard denies the merchant allegations and
believes that the “Honor All Cards” rule and
MasterCard practices with respect to debit card programs in the
United States are pro-competitive and fully consistent with U.S.
federal antitrust law.

On February 22, 2000, the district court
granted the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.
MasterCard and Visa subsequently appealed the decision to the
Second Circuit Court of Appeals. On October 17, 2001, a
three-judge panel affirmed the lower court decision by a
two-to-one majority. MasterCard filed a petition for a writ of
certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court on April 3, 2002,
which was denied on June 6, 2002.

Motions seeking summary judgment have been filed
by both sides and fully briefed in the district court. Arguments
for summary judgment motions were held on January 10, 2003.
The district court judge reserved decision on the motions. A
trial date of April 28, 2003 has been set.

Based upon publicly available information, the
plaintiffs previously have asserted damage claims in this
litigation of approximately $8 billion, before any trebling
under U.S. federal antitrust law. Other public estimates
(including estimates set forth in the dissenting opinion of the
Second Circuit) place the plaintiffs’ estimated damage
claims at approximately $50 billion to $100 billion,
depending on the source. In addition,



the plaintiffs’ damage claims could be
materially higher than these amounts as a result of the passage
of time and substantive changes in the theory of damages
presented by the plaintiffs. These figures reflect claims
asserted and should not be construed as an acknowledgement of
the reliability of the figures presented. MasterCard believes
that it is not currently possible to estimate the impact, if
any, that the ultimate resolution of this matter will have on
MasterCard’s results of operations, financial position or
cash flows.

Several lawsuits have been commenced by merchants
who have opted not to participate in the class action
litigation. Thus far, separate lawsuits have been commenced by
Meijer Stores, Toys “R” Us, Giant Eagle and Home
Depot. MasterCard is seeking to have all of these cases
transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of New York.

MasterCard cannot predict the outcome or
impact of various lawsuits relating to its currency conversion
practices.

MasterCard International, together with Visa
U.S.A., Inc. and Visa International Corp., are defendants in a
state court lawsuit pending in California. The lawsuit alleges
that MasterCard and Visa wrongfully imposed an asserted one
percent currency conversion “fee” on every credit card
transaction by U.S. MasterCard and Visa cardholders involving
the purchase of goods or services in a foreign country, and that
such alleged “fee” is unlawful. This action, titled
Schwartz v. Visa Int’l Corp., et al., was brought in
the Superior Court of California in February 2000, purportedly
on behalf of the general public. Trial of the Schwartz matter
commenced on May 20, 2002 and concluded on
November 27, 2002. The Schwartz action claims that the
alleged “fee” grossly exceeds any costs the defendants
might incur in connection with currency conversions relating to
credit card purchase transactions made in foreign countries and
is not properly disclosed to cardholders. Plaintiffs seek to
prevent defendants from continuing to engage in, use or employ
the alleged practice of charging and collecting the asserted one
percent currency conversion “fee” and from charging
any type of purported currency conversion “fee”
without providing a clear, obvious and comprehensive notice that
a fee will be charged. Plaintiffs also request an order
(1) requiring defendants to fund a corrective advertising
campaign; and (2) awarding restitution of the monies
allegedly wrongfully acquired by imposing the purported currency
conversion “fee”. The complaints assert that, during
the four-year period that preceded the respective lawsuits,
MasterCard collected approximately $200 million as a result
of allegedly imposing the claimed one percent currency
conversion “fee”. MasterCard denies these allegations.

On February 5, 2003, the trial court judge
issued a preliminary decision in the Schwartz matter, which is
under seal. In his decision, the trial judge found that
MasterCard’s currency conversion process does not violate
the Truth In Lending Act or regulations, nor is it
unconscionably priced under California law. However, the judge
found that the practice is deceptive under California state law,
and ordered that MasterCard mandate that members disclose the
currency conversion process to cardholders in cardholder
agreements, applications, solicitations and monthly billing
statements. The judge also ordered unspecified restitution to
California cardholders. The parties filed objections to the
preliminary decision on February 27, 2003. A hearing on the
objections was held on March 4, 2003. If the decision is
not modified prior to becoming final, MasterCard presently
intends to appeal the decision.

MasterCard International, Visa U.S.A., Inc., Visa
International Corp., several member banks including Citibank
(South Dakota), N.A., Citibank (Nevada), N.A., Chase Manhattan
Bank USA, N.A., Bank of America, N.A. (USA), MBNA, and Diners
Club are defendants in a number of federal putative class
actions that allege, among other things, violations of federal
antitrust laws based on the asserted one percent currency
conversion “fee”.

Pursuant to an order of the Judicial Panel on
Multidistrict Litigation, the federal complaints have been
consolidated in MDL No. 1409 before Judge William H. Pauley
III in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
York. In January 2002, the federal plaintiffs filed a
Consolidated Amended Complaint (“MDL Complaint”)
adding MBNA Corporation and MBNA America Bank, N.A. as
defendants. This pleading asserts two theories of antitrust
conspiracy under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.
§1: (i) an alleged “inter-association”
conspiracy among MasterCard (together with its members), Visa



(together with its members) and Diners Club to
fix currency conversion “fees” allegedly charged to
cardholders of “no less than 1% of the transaction amount
and frequently more;” and (ii) two alleged
“intra- association” conspiracies, whereby each of
Visa and MasterCard is claimed separately to have conspired with
its members to fix currency conversion “fees”
allegedly charged to cardholders of “no less than 1% of the
transaction amount” and “to facilitate and encourage
institution — and collection — of second tier currency
conversion surcharges.” The MDL Complaint also asserts that
the alleged currency conversion “fees” have not been
disclosed as required by the Truth In Lending Act and
Regulation Z.

Defendants have moved to dismiss the MDL
Complaint. Oral argument on that motion was held on
June 21, 2002 and Judge Pauley reserved decision. Pending
determination of defendants’ motion to dismiss, the parties
may engage in discovery except for non-custodial depositions. No
trial date has been set.

MasterCard believes that it is not currently
possible to estimate the impact, if any, that the ultimate
resolution of these matters will have on its results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.

MasterCard cannot predict the outcome or
impact of various legal and/or regulatory proceedings in
jurisdictions around the globe relating to interchange
fees.

Interchange fees represent a sharing of payment
system costs among the financial institutions participating in a
four-party payment card system such as MasterCard’s.
Generally, interchange fees are paid by acquirers to issuers in
connection with transactions initiated with the payment
system’s cards. These fees reimburse the issuer for a
portion of the costs incurred by it in providing services which
are of benefit to all participants in the system, including
acquirers and merchants. MasterCard establishes a multilateral
interchange fee (“MIF”) in certain circumstances as a
default fee that applies when there is no other interchange fee
arrangement between the issuer and the acquirer. MasterCard
establishes a variety of MIF rates depending on such
considerations as the location and the type of transaction, and
collects the MIF on behalf of the institutions entitled to
receive it, but does not itself receive the MIF. As described
more fully below, MIFs are subject to regulatory or legal review
and/or challenges in a number of jurisdictions. MasterCard
believes that it is not currently possible to estimate the
impact, if any, that the ultimate resolution of these matters
will have on its results of operations, financial position or
cash flows.

European Union.

In
September 2000, the European Commission issued a “Statement
of Objections” challenging Visa International’s
cross-border MIF under European Community competition rules. On
July 24, 2002, the European Commission announced its
decision to exempt the Visa MIF from these rules based on
certain changes proposed by Visa to its MIF. Among other things,
in connection with the exemption order, Visa agreed to adopt a
cost-based methodology for calculating its MIF similar to the
methodology employed by MasterCard, which considers the costs of
certain specified services provided by issuers, and to reduce
its MIF rates for debit and credit transactions to amounts at or
below certain specified levels.

Although MasterCard Europe is not an addressee of
the Statement of Objections, its rules also contain a
cross-border MIF. MasterCard Europe intends to engage in
discussions with the European Commission in order to determine
under what conditions the European Commission would grant a
formal exemption or comfort letter for MasterCard Europe’s
MIF. Because the cross-border MIF constitutes an essential
element of MasterCard Europe’s operations, changes to it
could significantly impact MasterCard International’s
European members and the MasterCard business in Europe. At this
time, it is not possible to determine what action the European
Commission will take with respect to MasterCard Europe’s
MIF.

United Kingdom Office of Fair Trading.

On September 25, 2001, the Office
of Fair Trading of the United Kingdom (“OFT”) issued a
Statement of Objections (“SOO”) under the
U.K. Competition Act 1998 challenging the MasterCard MIF,
the fee paid by the acquiring bank to the issuing bank in
connection with point of sale transactions and multilateral
service fee (“MSF”), the fee paid by issuing banks to
acquiring banks when a customer uses a MasterCard-branded card
in the United Kingdom either at an ATM or over the counter to
obtain a cash advance, established by MasterCard U.K.,
Members Forum Limited (formerly MEPUK) for domestic credit card
transactions in the United Kingdom. The SOO contained
preliminary conclusions to the effect that the MasterCard U.K.
MIF and MSF may infringe U.K. competition law and do



not qualify for an exemption in their present
forms. In January, 2002, MasterCard, MEPUK and several
MasterCard U.K. members responded to the SOO, and an oral
hearing concerning the matter was held on February 5, 2002.
On February 11, 2003, the OFT issued an amended SOO, which
also contains preliminary conclusions that challenge
MasterCard’s U.K. MIF under the Competition Act.

Because the MIF and MSF constitute essential
elements of MasterCard’s U.K. operations, changes to these
fees could significantly impact MasterCard’s U.K. members
and the MasterCard business in the U.K. At this time, it is not
possible to determine what action the OFT will take with respect
to the MasterCard MIF and MSF.

Australia.

On
August 27, 2002, the Reserve Bank of Australia
(“RBA”) announced regulations under the Payments
Systems (Regulation) Act 1998 (the “Act”) applicable
to four-party credit card payment systems in Australia,
including MasterCard’s. The RBA regulations would impose a
number of changes on the operation of four-party credit card
systems that could significantly impact MasterCard
International’s Australian members and the MasterCard
business in Australia. Among other things, the RBA regulations
permit non-deposit-taking institutions to issue credit cards and
acquire credit card transactions in Australia, mandate a formula
for calculating interchange fees that fails to account for
certain costs incurred by issuers (such as credit losses) and
effectively requires a reduction in domestic interchange fees,
and prohibit MasterCard and other four-party credit card systems
from enforcing their respective “no surcharge” and
“net issuer” rules. The no surcharge rule generally
prevents merchants from charging supplemental fees for the use
of payment cards at the point of sale, and the net issuer rule
requires institutions participating in the relevant system to
issue payment cards in addition to conducting merchant acquiring
activities.

On September 20, 2002, MasterCard filed an
application with the Federal Court of Australia seeking to
overturn the RBA regulations. MasterCard believes that in
implementing the regulations the RBA has failed to comply with
the obligations imposed upon it by the Act. Among other things,
MasterCard believes that the RBA regulations fail to satisfy the
public interest test mandated by the Act because they can be
expected to impose additional costs on Australian consumers,
place small businesses at a competitive disadvantage to larger
retailers, and encourage small or regional banks to exit the
credit card business in Australia. Visa International Corp.
filed a similar application with the Federal Court of Australia
on September 19, 2002. A hearing on the matter is scheduled
to begin on May 19, 2003. At this time, it is not possible
to determine the outcome of MasterCard’s legal challenge to
the RBA regulations.

United States.

In
July 2002, a putative class action lawsuit was filed by a group
of merchants in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of California against MasterCard International, Visa
U.S.A., Inc., Visa International Corp. and several member banks
in California, alleging, among other things, that
MasterCard’s and Visa’s interchange fees contravene
the Sherman Act. The suit seeks treble damages in an unspecified
amount, attorney’s fees and injunctive relief, including
the divestiture of bank ownership of MasterCard and Visa, and
the elimination of MasterCard and Visa marketing activities.
Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on
September 10, 2002. The motion has been fully briefed. The
case was recently reassigned to a new judge in federal district
court in San Francisco. Neither an oral argument date on the
motion nor a trial date has been set in this matter.

Other Jurisdictions.

MasterCard is aware that regulatory
authorities in certain other jurisdictions, including Japan,
Poland and Hong Kong, are reviewing MasterCard’s and/or its
members interchange fee practices and may seek to regulate the
establishment of such fees.

The payments industry is the subject of
increased regulatory focus in the United States and elsewhere,
which may impose costly new compliance burdens on MasterCard or
lead to decreased transaction volumes through MasterCard’s
systems.

Regulation of the payments industry, including
regulations applicable to MasterCard and our customers, has
increased significantly in recent years. For example, in 2002
MasterCard became subject to the regulatory requirements of
Section 352(a) of the USA PATRIOT Act. The USA PATRIOT Act
has required MasterCard to create and implement a comprehensive
anti-money laundering program, and has imposed similar
requirements on our customers. The U.S. Congress is presently
considering regulatory initiatives in the



areas of identity theft and internet gambling
that could impose additional compliance burdens on MasterCard or
our customers. Various regulatory agencies are also considering
regulations covering identity theft, account maintenance
guidelines and telemarketing that would impact directly our
customers. Increased regulatory focus on MasterCard may increase
our costs, which would negatively impact our financial
performance. Similarly, increased regulatory focus on our
customers may cause them to reduce the volume of transactions
processed through our systems, which would reduce our revenues
and also negatively impact our financial performance.

Our business may be adversely impacted by
the European Union’s adoption of regulation on cross-border
payments denominated in Euros.

In December 2001, the European Parliament and the
Council of the European Union adopted a new regulation requiring
that bank charges for cross-border payments denominated in euros
be the same as for similar transactions within a single member
state. This regulation is being adopted incrementally through
January 2006. Payments in non-euro currencies will also be
subject to the regulation if the member states where those
currencies are used notify the European Commission that they
want the rules to apply. Because a reduction in cross-border
transaction fees will reduce the profitability of certain
services offered by MasterCard’s European customers, it may
cause them to modify or withdraw these services. If such changes
result in an overall decline in transaction volumes, our
revenues from European operations may decline.

Because we have significant international
operations, we face additional risks related to global political
and economic conditions.

We operate in and intend to expand our business
further in countries throughout the world. We cannot be sure
that we will be able to broaden our global operations in a
cost-effective manner or compete effectively in all of our
targeted countries. There are risks inherent in conducting
business internationally, any of which could adversely affect
our operations, including:

If these risks materialize, they could have a
material adverse effect on our business. We cannot assure you
that we will continue to develop and implement effective
policies and strategies in each location where we do business.

Adverse currency fluctuations and foreign
exchange controls could decrease revenues we receive from our
international operations.

During 2002, approximately 39% of our revenues
were generated from activities outside the United States. Some
of the revenues we generate outside the United States are
subject to unpredictable and indeterminate fluctuations if the
values of international currencies change relative to the U.S.
dollar. Resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our
net income. Our risk management activities provide protection
with respect to adverse changes in the value of only a limited
number of currencies. Furthermore, we may become subject to
exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the
conversion of our revenue



currencies into U.S. dollars. The occurrence of
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our
business.

Item 2.

Properties

As of December 31, 2002, MasterCard and its
subsidiaries owned or leased 53 properties. We own our
corporate headquarters, a three-story, 472,600 square foot
building located in Purchase, New York. There is no outstanding
debt on this building. Our principal technology and operations
center is a 528,000 square foot leased facility located in
O’Fallon, Missouri, known as “Winghaven”. The
term of the lease on this facility is 10 years which
commenced on August 31, 1999. See Note 12 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. Our leased
properties in the United States are located in 9 states and
in the District of Columbia. We also lease properties in
32 other countries. These facilities primarily consist of
corporate and regional offices, as well as our operations
centers.

We believe that our facilities are suitable and
adequate for the business that we currently conduct. However, we
periodically review our space requirements and may acquire new
space to meet the needs of our business, or consolidate and
dispose of facilities that are no longer required.

PART II

Item 5.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity
    and Related Stockholder Matters

There is currently no established public trading
market for the common stock of MasterCard Incorporated. There
were approximately 1,275 holders of record of the common
stock of MasterCard Incorporated as of February 28, 2003.
We do not pay any cash dividends on our common stock and intend
to retain future earnings to fund the development and growth of
our business. Accordingly, we do not anticipate paying cash
dividends in the future. Payment of future dividends, if any,
would be at the discretion of our board of directors after
taking into account various factors, including our financial
condition, operating results and current and anticipated cash
needs. The common stock of MasterCard Incorporated is not
currently authorized to be issued in connection with any
compensation plan.

During the period covered by this Report,
MasterCard Incorporated did not make any sales of its equity
securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended.

Item 6.

Selected Financial Data

On June 28, 2002, we converted from a
membership to a stock company through the creation of MasterCard
Incorporated, a new holding company. Also on June 28, 2002,
MasterCard Incorporated directly and indirectly acquired all of
the outstanding stock of Europay International S.A.
(“EPI”) in the transaction that we refer to as the
“Integration”. On July 16, 2002, EPI was renamed
MasterCard Europe S.A. On September 30, 2002, MasterCard
Europe S.A. was reorganized in Belgium as MasterCard Europe
sprl. Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included herein more fully describes these transactions.

The selected consolidated financial data
presented below as of and for the year ended December 31,
2002 was derived from the audited consolidated financial
statements of MasterCard Incorporated and its consolidated
subsidiaries, including MasterCard International and MasterCard
Europe. The results of MasterCard Europe’s operations have
been included in our consolidated statements of income from June
28, 2002. The



data set forth below should be read in
conjunction with, and are qualified by reference to,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” and the Consolidated
Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in
this Report.

Set forth below are tables that provide
information regarding the performance results for the years
ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 for the payment programs
of MasterCard International and MasterCard Europe, the principal
operating subsidiaries of MasterCard Incorporated. The
information regarding MasterCard’s payment programs for the
year ended December 31, 2001 has been restated to present the
information on the same basis as the information in the tables
for the year ended December 31, 2002 and to reflect
revisions to certain historical statistical information provided
by MasterCard’s members subsequent to the previous release
of this information by MasterCard. These revisions do not have a
material impact on MasterCard’s reported financial results
for the relevant period. The tables set forth the gross dollar
volume (“GDV”), purchase volume, cash volume and the
number of purchase transactions, cash transactions, accounts and
cards on a regional basis for MasterCard-branded cards. Growth
rates over prior periods are provided for volume-based data.
European activity is included for the periods presented,
including periods prior to the Integration as described in
Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included
herein.

For purposes of the tables: GDV represents
purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of
balance transfers and convenience checks; purchase volume means
the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with
MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and cash
volume means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements
obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period.
The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are
MasterCard-branded payment accounts in connection with which
functional cards are not generally issued.

The MasterCard payment product is comprised of
both credit programs and off-line debit programs, and certain
data relating to each type of program is included in the tables.
Credit programs include MasterCard-branded credit and charge
programs. Off-line debit programs include MasterCard-branded
debit programs where the primary means of cardholder validation
at the point of sale is for cardholders to sign a sales receipt.

Information denominated in U.S. dollars is
calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/ local
currency exchange rate for each local currency in which
MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are
calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate
for each quarter. However, MasterCard reports period-over-period
rates of change in GDV, purchase volume and cash volume solely
on the basis of local currency information, in order to
eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign
currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of
change. Accordingly, the period-over-period rates of change set
forth in the tables cannot be extrapolated directly by reference
to dollar volume information presented by MasterCard for the
current and historical periods.

The data set forth in the tables below is
estimated based on information provided by customers and other
sources that is subject to certain limited logical and
statistical verification by MasterCard and partial cross-



checking against information provided by
MasterCard’s transaction processing systems. In addition, a
portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards columns
reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among members
and other practices that may lead to over counting of the
underlying data in certain circumstances.

The tables include information with respect to
MasterCard-branded transactions that are not processed by
MasterCard. Maestro and Cirrus on-line debit transactions,
Mondex transactions and certain other branded transactions are
not included in the tables.

In addition, the number of acceptance locations
reported by our customers elsewhere in this Report includes
merchant locations, automated teller machines and other
locations where cash may be obtained using MasterCard-branded
cards. In certain countries, merchant locations include data
relating to all acceptance terminals deployed at individual
merchants.

Results of Operations

On June 28, 2002, we acquired all of the
outstanding stock of Europay International S.A.
(“EPI”) not previously owned by MasterCard
International. On July 16, 2002, EPI, as a wholly owned
subsidiary of MasterCard Incorporated, was renamed MasterCard
Europe S.A. On September 30, 2002, MasterCard Europe S.A.
was reorganized in Belgium as MasterCard Europe. The results of
MasterCard Europe’s operations have been included in our
consolidated statements of income of the Company from
June 28, 2002.

Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared
    to Year Ended December 31, 2001

Revenue was $1.892 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2002 compared to $1.611 billion for
the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of
$281 million or 17%, of which $143 million or 9% was
due to the acquisition of MasterCard Europe. Our revenue is
comprised of operations fees and assessments. On January 1,
2002, we implemented Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No. 01-9, “Accounting for Consideration Given by a
Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s
Products)” (“EITF 01-9”) and reclassified as
a reduction of revenue certain payments to customers and
merchants that were previously recognized as advertising and
market development expense. We anticipate that future revenue
growth will be moderated by additional investments in our
business.

Operations fees represent user fees for
authorization, clearing, settlement and other products and
services that facilitate transaction and information management
among our customers on a global basis. Operations fees are
generally driven by transactions. The number of transactions
processed increased to approximately 8.943 billion for the
year ended December 31, 2002, compared to approximately
7.765 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001, an
increase of approximately 15%. The preceding figure reflects
certain revisions to the previously reported number of
transactions processed. Using the revised information, processed
transactions for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2002 were 2.339 billion and 6.479 billion, respectively. During
the year-ended December 31, 2002, MasterCard
branded-transactions, including transactions not processed by
the Company, increased to approximately 13.577 billion from
approximately 11.731 billion in the prior year, an increase
of approximately 16%. MasterCard Europe transactions are
included in both



periods. Operations fees were $1.231 billion
for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to
$1.083 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001,
an increase of $149 million or 14%. Approximately
$69 million of operations fees in 2002 were due to the
acquisition of MasterCard Europe. Increases in operations fees
were partially offset by a $9 million decline in warning
bulletin revenue in the year ended December 31, 2002
compared to the year ended December 31, 2001, exclusive of
MasterCard Europe’s warning bulletin revenue. Operations
fees were also offset by lower average pricing based on the
Company’s pricing structure, which rewards customers with
lower prices for incremental volume, and a $13 million
increase in rebates provided to customers in the year ended
December 31, 2002 over the same period in 2001.

Assessments predominantly represent payments made
by members of MasterCard International in respect of their card
programs carrying the marks of one or more of the brands within
the MasterCard family of brands, principally the MasterCard,
Maestro and Cirrus brands. Assessments were approximately
$660 million for the year ended December 31, 2002
compared to $528 million for the year ended
December 31, 2001, an increase of approximately
$132 million or 25%. Approximately $75 million of our
assessments in 2002 were due to our acquisition of MasterCard
Europe. In addition, the increase in assessments was
attributable to an increase in gross dollar volume
(“GDV”) between the periods. GDV represents gross
usage (purchase and cash disbursements) on MasterCard cards for
goods and services including balance transfers and convenience
checks. GDV growth in 2002 as compared to 2001 was approximately
15% when measured in local currency and approximately 16% when
measured on a U.S. dollar converted basis. GDV was
$1.142 trillion for the year ended December 31, 2002
compared to $986 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2001. GDV includes MasterCard Europe activity
in both periods presented. Offsetting the increase in
assessments were rebates and incentives provided to customers,
which increased by $53 million in the year ended
December 31, 2002 over the same period in 2001. A
significant portion of the increase was related to the
acquisition of MasterCard Europe.

Operating expenses were $1.750 billion for
the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to
$1.390 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001,
an increase of $360 million or 26%. Our operating expenses
are comprised of general and administrative, advertising and
market development, depreciation and amortization expenses.
Operating expenses increased $169 million due to our
acquisition of MasterCard Europe. We expect to continue to
invest significantly, primarily in advertising and marketing
support over the next several years to accelerate our profitable
growth and to enhance the global position of MasterCard and its
customers. The primary focus of these initiatives is to build
brand recognition, promote brand acceptance, and to enhance the
development of our programs and services. There is no assurance
that these initiatives will be successful. We expect operating
expenses to increase significantly over the next several years
as a result of these initiatives.

General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of personnel, telecommunications, data processing,
travel and professional fees. General and administrative
expenses were $965 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002 compared to $814 million for the
year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of
$151 million or 19%. This increase was primarily
attributable to increases in personnel costs of
$105 million resulting from increases in additional
personnel, including the impact of the acquisition of MasterCard
Europe, and salary increases in 2002. Approximately
$78 million of general and administrative expenses in 2002
were due to the acquisition of MasterCard Europe. General and
administrative expenses include net foreign exchange losses of
$2 million and $7 million for 2002 and 2001, respectively.
These net foreign exchange losses primarily result from forward
contracts.

For the year ended December 31, 2002, we
made significant investments in advertising and market
development to build value in our brands and to develop programs
to differentiate ourselves from our competition. Advertising and
market development expenses were $694 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002 compared to $506 million for
the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of
$188 million or 37%, primarily consisting of a
$91 million increase in advertising expense, a
$74 million increase in promotions and sponsorships
expense, and a $23 million increase in marketing expense.
Approximately $73 million of advertising and market
development expenses in 2002 were due to the acquisition of
MasterCard Europe.

Our increased advertising and market development
expenses were related to a number of key initiatives in 2002.
MasterCard was a sponsor of the 2002 FIFA World Cup which
required a significant amount of resources in 2002 for the
sponsorship fee, special programming, promotions and event
marketing. Other



significant sponsorships during 2002 included
Major League Baseball and the Professional Golf Association.
MasterCard also incurred increased advertising spending for
special programming associated with the Grammy and Academy
awards. In 2002, we significantly increased our investment in
advertising and market support to increase brand recognition and
promote brand acceptance. We plan to accelerate and increase the
investment in advertising, as well as other programs and
sponsorships in 2003 and for several years thereafter.

Depreciation expense was $40 million in each
of the years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31,
2001. During 2001, certain assets were written off due to the
move to our Winghaven technology center. See Note 12 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. Accordingly,
the Company’s depreciation expense decreased in 2002. This
decrease in depreciation was offset by approximately
$7 million of depreciation expense that was due to the
acquisition of MasterCard Europe.

Amortization expense was $51 million for the
year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $30 million
for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of
$20 million. This increase was primarily driven by
$11 million of amortization expense due to the acquisition
of MasterCard Europe as well as additional amortization of
capitalized computer software.

Other income (expense) was $16 million for
the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to
$11 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, an
increase of $5 million. Other income (expense) comprises
primarily interest, dividend and other investment income related
to the portfolio of investments held, as well as interest
expense, minority interest and other expense. The acquisition of
MasterCard Europe accounted for $2 million of the increase
in other income and expense.

The effective tax rate for the year ended
December 31, 2002 decreased to 26.5% from 39.0 % for the
year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in the effective
tax rate was attributable to several items, some of which are
not expected to recur. In December 2002, the Belgium
statutory tax rate was reduced from 40.2% to 34.0%. As a result,
deferred income tax liabilities established in connection with
the acquisition of MasterCard Europe were reduced based on the
lower Belgian income tax rate. In addition, we anticipate
settling certain tax examinations on a favorable basis. The
effective tax rate was also decreased by a change in the
geographic distribution of pretax income in the United States
from jurisdictions with higher state tax rates to those with
lower rates. Furthermore, we realized significant foreign tax
credits that we were previously unable to claim. The benefits of
these items in lowering the effective tax rate were partially
offset by a one-time increase in state income tax expense
attributable to lower deferred state tax assets as a result of
lower state tax rates.

As a result of the foregoing, our net income was
$116 million for the year ended December 31, 2002
compared to $142 million for the year ended
December 31, 2001, a decrease of $26 million or 18%.
The net loss of $7 million resulting from the acquisition of
MasterCard Europe contributed to the decrease in net income for
the year ended December 31, 2002. The initiatives discussed
above, which involve significant expenditures to support and
build value in the MasterCard family of brands, could result in
lower net income or slower net income growth over the next
several years.

Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared
    to Year Ended December 31, 2000

Revenue was $1.611 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2001 compared to $1.445 billion for
the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of
$166 million or 12%. Our revenue is comprised of operations
fees and assessments.

Operations fees represent user fees for
authorization, clearing, settlement and other products and
services that facilitate transaction and information management
among our customers on a global basis. Operations fees were
$1.083 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001
compared to $970 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000, an increase of $113 million or 12%.
This increase was primarily attributable to the number of
transactions processed by MasterCard. Operations fees were
offset by lower average pricing based on the Company’s
pricing structure, which rewards customers with lower prices for
incremental volume and a $27 million increase in rebates
provided to customers in the year ended December 31, 2001
over the same period in 2000. During the same period, MasterCard
branded-transactions, including transactions not processed by
the Company, increased to approximately 11.731 billion from
approximately 9.994 billion, an increase of approximately
17%.



Assessments predominantly represent payments made
by members of MasterCard International in respect of their card
programs carrying the marks of one or more of the brands within
the MasterCard family of brands, principally MasterCard, Maestro
and Cirrus brands. Assessments were $528 million for the
year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $475 million
for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of
$53 million or 11%. The increase in assessments was
attributable primarily to an increase in GDV between the
periods. GDV represents gross usage (purchase and cash
disbursements) on MasterCard cards for goods and services,
including balance transfers and convenience checks. GDV growth
in 2001 as compared to 2000 was approximately 18% when measured
in local currency and approximately 14% when measured on a
U.S. dollar converted basis. Offsetting the increase in
assessments were rebates and incentives provided to customers,
which increased $54 million in the year ended
December 31, 2001 over the same period in 2000.

While the events of September 11, 2001 did
not have a significant impact on MasterCard’s total volume,
they did impact the mix between domestic and international
volumes experienced by MasterCard. International volume
decreased dramatically in the weeks following
September 11th, due to decreased international travel and
related expenditures. However, this decrease was partially
offset by higher domestic volume. Toward the end of the year,
volumes began to recover, which helped drive the overall
increase in revenue over the prior year.

Operating expenses were $1.390 billion for
the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to
$1.267 billion for the year ended December 31, 2000,
an increase of $122 million or 10%. Our operating expenses
are comprised of general and administrative, advertising and
market development, depreciation and amortization expenses.

General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of personnel, telecommunications, data processing,
travel and professional fees. General and administrative
expenses were $814 million for the year ended
December 31, 2001 compared to $737 million for the
year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of
$77 million or 10%. This increase was primarily
attributable to increases in personnel costs resulting from
increases in additional personnel and compensation.

For the year ended December 31, 2001,
MasterCard made significant investments in advertising and
market development to support and build value in the MasterCard
family of brands, and to develop new and distinct programs to
differentiate ourselves from our competition. Advertising and
market development expenses were $506 million for the year
ended December 31, 2001 compared to $471 million for
the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of
$35 million or 7%. Our promotions and sponsorship fees
increased between the periods primarily as a result of
incremental promotions in the year ended December 31, 2001,
such as the National Hockey League Celebrity Cup Face-off, as
well as increased contractual sponsorship fees associated with
the FIFA World Cup, Copa America, National Hockey League, Major
League Baseball and PGA Golf organizations. These increases were
partially offset by reductions in media expenditures between the
periods in traditional television venues and the Internet.

Depreciation expense was $40 million for the
year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $35 million
for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of
$5 million or 14%, primarily due to purchases of equipment
in 2001.

Amortization expense was $30 million for the
year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $25 million
for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of
approximately $6 million or 23%. This increase was primarily the
result of additional amortization of capitalized computer
software, partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of
franchise rights in 2001 due to the write-down of Mondex
franchise rights in certain Asian countries to their estimated
fair value in 2000.

Other income (expense) was $11 million for
the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to
$22 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, a
decrease of $11 million or 49%. Other income (expense)
comprises primarily interest, dividend and other investment
income related to the portfolio of investments held, as well as
interest expense, minority interest and other expense. The
decrease in other income (expense) was primarily the result of a
devaluation of the trading securities portfolio.



The effective tax rate for the year ended
December 31, 2001 decreased to 39.0% from 41.0% for the
year ended December 31, 2000. The lower rate for the year
ended December 31, 2001 was primarily due to the
utilization for income tax purposes of a loss related to foreign
operations, the apportionment of pre-tax income to states with a
lower tax rate and a larger amount of tax-exempt interest income
as a percentage of pre-tax income than in the year ended
December 31, 2000.

As a result of the foregoing, our net income was
$142 million for the year ended December 31, 2001
compared to $118 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000, an increase of $24 million or 20%.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We need capital resources and liquidity to fund
our global development, to cover any settlement risk, to finance
our capital expenditures and any future acquisitions and to
service the payments of principal and interest on our
outstanding debt, and other contractual commitments. At
December 31, 2002, we had $841 million of liquid
investments with which to manage operations. We expect that the
cash generated from operations, and our borrowing capacity will
be sufficient to meet our operating, working capital and capital
needs in 2003. In addition, we believe that our resources are
sufficient to fund our initiatives to accelerate our profitable
growth and to enhance the global position of MasterCard in 2003.

For the year ended December 31, 2002, net
cash provided by operating activities was $306 million
compared to $196 million and $260 million for the
years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The
increase in cash provided by operating activities in the year
ended December 31, 2002 was principally due to changes in
settlement due to and from members. Our accrued expenses and
accounts payable increased for the year ended December 31,
2002 due to increased spending for advertising and our focus on
working capital management.

Net cash used in investing activities was
$112 million, $219 million and $322 million for
the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. The outlay of cash in 2002 was primarily due to
capital expenditures, expenditures for capitalized software, and
purchases of investment securities available-for-sale. Capital
expenditures were predominantly associated with investments in
data center equipment. Investment securities available-for-sale
increased as a result of investments made with excess funds.
Those uses were offset by $31 million of cash received, net
of acquisition-related expenses, from the acquisition of
MasterCard Europe during the second quarter of 2002.

Net cash (used in) provided by financing
activities for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and
2000 was $(35) million, $5 million and
$(6) million, respectively. In all years, financing
activities relate to (repayments) advances of MasterCard’s
net settlement overdraft positions. See Note 11 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.

Our financial position continues to reflect
strong liquidity. Working capital, consisting of current assets
less current liabilities, was $526 million at
December 31, 2002 and $468 million at
December 31, 2001, representing a working capital ratio of
1.6 and 1.7 in 2002 and 2001, respectively.

In addition to our liquid investments, we provide
for liquidity through a 364-day revolving credit facility (the
“Credit Facility”) with certain financial institutions
that expires on June 3, 2003. Under the terms of the Credit
Facility, MasterCard has commitments of $1.2 billion that
can be borrowed in the form of revolving loans. Interest is
charged at the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)
plus 28 basis points, and the rate increases depending upon the
amount of any draw down. Under the Credit Facility, MasterCard
has agreed to pay a facility fee equal to 7 basis points per
annum on each lender’s commitment. See Note 11 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.



We have entered into contractual commitments
associated with operating lease agreements for office space and
equipment as well as for sponsorship, licensing and other
agreements. Obligations relating to these contractual
commitments are estimated to be payable in the following periods:

In the normal course of business, MasterCard
operates systems for clearing and settling payment transactions
among its members. Net settlements are generally cleared daily
among members by wire transfer or other bank clearing means, via
settlement cash accounts. However, some transactions may not
settle until subsequent business days due to varying local
currency settlement value date intervals and other timing
differences. These timing differences result in amounts from
members or amounts due to members for a duration normally
ranging from one to four calendar days and are included in the
balance sheet of MasterCard as settlement due to/due from
members. The net impact of the settled transactions was the main
contributor to the net settlement cash account overdraft
position of $10 million at December 31, 2001, which was
recorded in other current liabilities. No overdraft positions
existed at December 31, 2002.

Primarily due to uncertainty surrounding
lawsuits, in particular the merchant antitrust litigation
described in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included herein, on June 17, 2002 Standard &
Poor’s placed MasterCard on negative outlook. However,
Standard & Poor’s reaffirmed MasterCard’s
credit rating on September 4, 2002.

The adverse outcome of certain of the legal
proceedings described in Note 14 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included herein could have a detrimental
impact on liquidity and capital resources if they result in
adverse awards of damages to the relevant plaintiffs.

Overall, we believe our cash provided by
operating activities, our liquid investments and the Credit
Facility provide sufficient liquidity to meet our ongoing
business requirements.

Economic Fluctuations

Although we cannot precisely determine the impact
of inflation on our operations, we do not believe our operations
have been significantly affected by inflation. For the most
part, we have utilized technology and operating efficiencies to
offset increased operating expenses. In addition, a portion of
our revenues is based upon a percentage of GDV, which partially
insulates operating margins on these revenues from the effects
of inflation.

Portions of our business can be seasonal. Revenue
is generally favorably affected by progressively increased card
purchasing volume throughout the year, particularly in the
fourth quarter during the holiday shopping period.

Member Relationships and Related
Parties

We have a diversified member base of
approximately 2,300 principal members and approximately 23,000
affiliate members. Our stockholders are all principal members of
MasterCard International. In the normal course of business, we
enter into transactions with our members and operate a system
for authorizing, clearing and settling payment transactions
among the members of MasterCard International. These members do
not



constitute related parties pursuant to Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 57
“Related Party Disclosures”.

Certain of our members generate in excess of five
percent of our revenue. The loss of any of these members could
adversely impact MasterCard’s net income. In addition, as
part of our business initiative to increase our share,
MasterCard, among other efforts, enters into business agreements
with members. These agreements can be terminated in a variety of
circumstances. Under certain circumstances, we may be required
to permit members in the United States that have entered into
agreements with us to terminate those agreements without penalty
as a result of the current antitrust litigation being brought
against us by the U.S. Department of Justice. Any
termination of these agreements could have an adverse impact on
our financial condition. However, we believe that it is not
currently possible to estimate the impact, if any, that the
termination of any member business agreements would have on our
results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Critical Accounting Policies &
Estimates

Our accounting policies are integral to
understanding the results of operations and financial condition.
Our accounting policies are described in detail in the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. We are
required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting periods. We have established detailed
policies and control procedures to ensure the methods used to
make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and applied
consistently from period to period. In addition, the policies
and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for
changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The
following is a brief description of our current accounting
policies involving significant management judgment.

Revenue Recognition

Certain revenues are estimated based upon
transactional information accumulated from our systems and using
historical performance.

We have business agreements with certain members
that provide for fee rebates when the customers meet certain
hurdles. Such rebates are generally calculated on a monthly
basis based upon the estimated customer’s performance and
the contracted discount rates for the services provided, and are
recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period as the
revenue is earned.

In addition, we enter into agreements with
certain customers to provide volume-based and support incentives
that are recorded as a reduction of revenue in accordance with
Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue
No. 01-9, “Accounting for Consideration Given by a
Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s
Products)” (“EITF 01-9”). Incentives are
based on management’s estimate of the customer’s
performance in a given period.

Our estimate of customers’ performance is a
critical component in the calculation of rebates and incentives.
Customers’ performance is estimated by using historical
performance, discussions with our customers and transactional
information accumulated from our systems. The estimated
performance is used to calculate the rebates and incentives
based upon the related customer agreements. Actual results may
differ from these estimates.

Capitalized Software

Our capitalized software, which includes internal
and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining computer
software for internal use, is capitalized in other intangible
assets in the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with
Statement of Position 98-1, “Accounting for the Costs
of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal
Use” and related guidance. Development costs are expensed
during the preliminary project management phase until it is
probable that the project will be completed and the software
will be used to perform the function intended. Thereafter, all
qualifying direct internal and external costs related to the



design, development and testing phase are
capitalized, and upon the project being substantially complete
and ready for its intended use, are amortized using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the
software, not to exceed three years. Costs related to
post-implementation activities for software that is developed or
obtained for internal use are expensed as incurred.

We are required to make judgments to determine
the feasibility of the project for its intended use and the
phase of the projects. In addition, we estimate the internal
costs based on hours spent on the design, development and
testing phases of the project. These judgments and estimates
impact the accounting for capitalized software in our financial
statements.

Impairment

We test goodwill and intangible assets for
impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets” and test property, plant and
equipment for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144,
“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets”. We test equity investments for a loss in value,
which is other than temporary, in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board No. 18, “The Equity Method of
Accounting for Investments in Common Stock”. Whenever
indicators of impairment exist, these assets are tested.
Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested
at least annually.

Our test for impairment requires management to
make assumptions regarding the expected net future cash flows of
each asset. These assumptions are based on our internal
forecasts. If the sum of expected net future cash flows
(undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the
carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized.
The loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount
of the asset exceeds its fair value calculated using the present
value of estimated net future cash flows or other methodologies.

Goodwill and intangible assets represent a
significant portion of our balance sheet. Therefore, an
impairment could result in a material reduction of our assets,
as well as our net income.

Litigation Accrual

We are a party to legal proceedings with respect
to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of business.
Except as described in Note 14 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included herein, MasterCard does not
believe that any legal proceedings to which it is a party would
have a material adverse impact on its business or prospects.

In accordance with SFAS No. 5,
“Accounting for Contingencies”, we accrue legal costs
that are expected to be incurred to defend MasterCard relating
to certain litigation. The accrual is estimated based on
management’s expectations of foreseeable costs as
determined in consultation with outside counsel. Our policy has
been applied since the commencement of certain litigation.
Changes in the estimated amount or timing of legal costs can
significantly impact our results of operations.

Outside of foreseeable legal costs, we believe
that it is not currently possible to estimate the impact, if
any, that the ultimate resolution of legal proceedings will have
in our results of operations, financial position or cash flows
and, as such, consistent with SFAS No. 5, no accrual has
been made.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, “Business
Combinations” (“SFAS 141”). SFAS 141
supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion (“APB”)
No. 16, “Business Combinations” and requires that
the purchase method of accounting be used for all business
combinations initiated or completed after June 30, 2001.
SFAS 141 specifies criteria for the recognition of certain
intangible assets apart from goodwill. The acquisition of EPI,
as discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included herein, was accounted for in accordance with
SFAS 141.

In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”).
SFAS 142 supersedes APB No. 17, “Intangible
Assets” and



primarily addresses the financial accounting and
reporting for acquired goodwill and intangible assets subsequent
to their acquisition. SFAS 142 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2001 and was adopted by
the Company on January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 142 requires
that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will
no longer be amortized and must be tested for impairment at
least annually. SFAS 142 further requires that intangible
assets with finite useful lives be amortized over their useful
lives and reviewed periodically for impairment. The Statement
requires that transitional goodwill (goodwill recorded before
the adoption of SFAS No. 142) be tested for impairment
within six months of adoption of SFAS 142. Accordingly,
MasterCard tested the goodwill on its books prior to the
acquisition of EPI and no impairment was required. The goodwill
and intangible assets that resulted from the acquisition of EPI
was accounted for in accordance with SFAS 142. The Company
evaluated goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets
recorded in connection with the EPI acquisition as of the
beginning of the fourth quarter of 2002, as part of its annual
impairment analysis. The adoption of SFAS 142 did not have
a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included herein.

In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”
(“SFAS 144”). SFAS 144 addresses financial
accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of
long-lived assets and supercedes FASB Statement No. 121,
“Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of”. SFAS 144 also
supersedes certain aspects of APB No. 30, “Reporting
the Results of Operations — Reporting the Effects of
Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual
and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions”, with
regard to reporting the effects of a disposal of a segment of a
business and will require expected future operating losses from
discontinued operations to be reported in discontinued
operations in the period incurred (rather than as of the
measurement date as required by APB No. 30). The Company
adopted SFAS 144 on January 1, 2002. The adoption of
SFAS 144 did not have an impact on the Company’s
financial position or results of operations.

In February 2002, the EITF finalized Issue
No. 01-9 “Accounting for Consideration Given by a
Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s
Products)”. EITF 01-9 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2001 and provides guidance on
the income statement classification of consideration from a
vendor to a customer in connection with the customer’s
purchase of the vendor’s products or to promote sales of
the vendor’s products. On January 1, 2002, MasterCard
implemented EITF 01-9 which resulted in certain payments to
customers and merchants previously classified as advertising and
market development expense being reclassified as a reduction of
revenue. The amounts of such consideration were
$167 million and $127 million for the years ended
December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Incentives are
based on management’s estimate of the customer’s
performance as detailed in the agreements in a given period and
actual results may differ from these estimates.

In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, “Accounting
for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities”
(“SFAS 146”). SFAS 146 addresses financial
accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or
disposal activities and supercedes EITF Issue No. 94-3,
“Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination
Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain
Costs Incurred in a Restructuring).” SFAS 146 requires
companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal
activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a
commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Costs associated with
exit or disposal activities for entities newly acquired in a
business combination are not within the scope of SFAS 146.
The provisions of SFAS 146 are effective for exit or
disposal activities that are initiated after December 31,
2002, with early application encouraged. The Company early
adopted SFAS 146 on July 1, 2002. The adoption of
SFAS 146 did not have a material impact on the
Company’s financial position or results of operations.

In November 2002, the EITF concluded on Issue
No. 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables”, (“EITF 00-21”).
EITF 00-21 addresses how to determine when a revenue
arrangement for multiple deliverables should be divided into
separate units of accounting and, if separation is appropriate,
how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to the
identified accounting units. The provisions of EITF 00-21
are effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal
periods beginning after June 15, 2003. MasterCard is in the
process of determining the impact, if any, of adopting this
accounting pronouncement.



In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation
No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others” (“FIN 45”).
FIN 45 requires that upon the issuance of a guarantee, the
guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the
obligation it assumes under the guarantee. FIN 45’s
provisions for initial recognition and measurement should be
applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified
after December 31, 2002, irrespective of the
guarantor’s fiscal year end. The disclosure requirements
are effective for financial statements of both interim and
annual periods that end after December 15, 2002. MasterCard
has complied with the disclosure requirements and is in the
process of determining the impact, if any, of adopting the
provisions for initial recognition and measurement for
guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation
No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities” (“FIN 46”). FIN 46 clarifies
that companies may need to consolidate certain entities in which
equity investors do not have the characteristics of a
controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity
at risk for the entity to finance its activities without
additional subordinated financial support from other parties.
FIN 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities
created or in which an enterprise obtains an interest after
January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created
before February 1, 2003, FIN 46 is applicable in the
first fiscal year or interim period beginning after
June 15, 2003. The impact of consolidating the special
purpose entity is discussed in detail in Note 12 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.

Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk

Market risk is the potential for economic losses
to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from
adverse changes in market indices such as interest rates and
foreign currency exchange rates. We have limited exposure to
market risk from changes in both interest rates and foreign
exchange rates. Management establishes and oversees the
implementation of board of director approved policies governing
our funding, investments, and use of derivative financial
instruments and we monitor aggregate risk exposures on an
ongoing basis.

We enter into forward currency contracts to
minimize risk associated with anticipated revenues and expenses
and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
This activity minimizes our exposure to transaction gains and
losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against
the U.S. dollar and euro. As a result of the acquisition of
MasterCard Europe, MasterCard’s market risk exposures at
December 31, 2002 are greater than December 31, 2001.

At December 31, 2002 and 2001, forward
currency contracts against the dollar were both sold (with
notional amounts of $25 million and $3 million,
respectively) and purchased (with notional amounts of
$39 million and $11 million, respectively). Based on
the year-end 2002 and 2001 foreign exchange positions, the
effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the
U.S. dollar is estimated to create a loss valued at
$1.3 million and $0.7 million at December 31,
2002 and 2001, respectively.

In 2002, due to the acquisition of MasterCard
Europe, forward currency contracts against the euro were both
sold (with notional amounts of $8 million) and purchased
(with notional amounts of $199 million). A hypothetical
10 percent strengthening of the euro is estimated to create
a loss valued at $17 million at December 31, 2002. The
terms of the forward currency contracts are generally less than
12 months and are utilized to manage anticipated cash flows
in major overseas markets for the subsequent year.

Our settlement activities may be subject to
foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate
fluctuations. This risk is limited to the extent that the
timeframe between setting the foreign exchange rate for
financial transactions and the clearing of settlement positions
is typically one business day and is limited to seventeen stable
transaction currencies. The remaining 145 transaction currencies
are settled in U.S. dollars or require local settlement
netting arrangements that minimize our foreign exchange exposure.

Our interest sensitive assets are our debt
instruments, which we hold as investments. They are rated AA or
above and primarily consist of fixed rate short and medium-term
notes. With respect to fixed maturities, our general policy is
to invest in high quality securities, while providing adequate
liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant
exposure. Based on the net present value of expected future cash
flows, a



100 basis point increase in interest rates,
assuming a parallel shift of the yield curve, would result in
fair value changes and an unrealized loss recorded in other
comprehensive income of $15 million and $14 million
for 2002 and 2001, respectively.

We own trading securities, which are comprised of
equity securities held in connection with an executive
compensation plan. The effect of a hypothetical 10 percent
decline in market value would result in a loss of
$3 million and $4 million for December 31, 2002
and 2001, respectively. These securities are part of a deferred
executive compensation plan. Therefore, an offsetting gain of
$2 million and $3 million for December 31, 2002
and 2001, respectively, would be recorded in general and
administrative expense.

At December 31, 2002 and 2001, we had
various credit facilities to provide liquidity in the event of
material member settlement failures, settlement service
operations and other operational needs. These credit facilities
have variable rates which are applied to the borrowing based on
terms and conditions set forth in each agreement. See
Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included
herein.

Note 1.

Organization

MasterCard Incorporated is a stock company
incorporated under the laws of Delaware, United States of
America. MasterCard Incorporated and its consolidated
subsidiaries, including MasterCard International Incorporated
(“MasterCard International”) and MasterCard Europe
sprl (together, “MasterCard” or the
“Company”), provide transaction processing and related
services to customers principally in support of their credit,
deposit access, electronic cash, Automated Teller Machine
(“ATM”) payment card programs, and travelers cheque
programs. MasterCard enters into transactions with its customers
in the normal course of business and operates a system for
authorizing, clearing and settling payment transactions among
its customers. The Company’s stockholders are all principal
members of MasterCard International.

As more fully described in Note 4, MasterCard
converted from a membership to a stock company on June 28,
2002 through the creation of MasterCard Incorporated, a new
holding company. Also on June 28, 2002, as more fully
described in Note 4, MasterCard Incorporated directly and
indirectly acquired all of the outstanding stock of Europay
International S.A. (“EPI”), a company incorporated
under the laws of Belgium, not previously owned by MasterCard
International. On July 16, 2002, EPI was renamed MasterCard
Europe S.A. On September 30, 2002, MasterCard Europe S.A.
was reorganized in Belgium as MasterCard Europe sprl
(“MasterCard Europe”).

Note 2.

Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

Consolidation and basis of
presentation

— The Company
follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Certain prior period amounts have been
reclassified to conform to 2002 classifications. The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
MasterCard and its majority-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany
transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

The Company consolidates entities when it owns
more than 50% ownership and when it exercises control. Minority
interest is recorded for consolidated entities in which the
Company owns less than 100% of the interest. Minority interest
represents the equity interest not owned by the Company.

The Company accounts for investments in
affiliates under the equity method of accounting when it holds
between 20% and 50% ownership in the entity and when it
exercises significant influence. The equity method of accounting
is also utilized for limited partnerships and limited liability
companies if the investment ownership percentage is greater than
3% of outstanding ownership interests or common stock,
respectively, regardless of whether MasterCard has significant
influence over the investees. MasterCard’s share of net
earnings of entities accounted for under the equity method of
accounting is included in investment income on the consolidated
statements of income.

The Company accounts for investments in
affiliates under the historical cost method of accounting when
it holds less than 20% ownership in the entity and when it does
not exercise significant influence.

Investments in affiliates for which the equity
method and historical cost method of accounting is appropriate
are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

Use of
estimates

— The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting periods. Actual results may differ from
these estimates.

Special purpose entity
(“SPE”)

—
MasterCard International is the lessee in one synthetic lease
transaction involving an SPE. The SPE was established for a
single discrete purpose, is not an operating entity, has a
limited life and has no employees. The legal documents that
govern MasterCard’s SPE transaction



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share
data)

describe how the cash earned on the assets held
in the SPE must be allocated to the investors and other parties
that have rights to these cash flows. The SPE leases
MasterCard’s Winghaven facility located in O’Fallon,
Missouri, and subleases this facility to MasterCard
International (see Note 12). The decision whether to
consolidate the SPE depends not only on the applicable
accounting principles for SPEs and the treatment of the
synthetic lease as operating or capital, but also on a
determination regarding the nature and amount of the investments
made by third parties in the SPE. Consideration is given, for
example, to whether a third party has made a substantive equity
investment in the SPE, which party has voting rights, who makes
decisions about the assets in the SPE, and who is at risk for
loss. The SPE is not consolidated because, under current
applicable accounting principles, MasterCard does not exercise
control over the risks and rewards of the assets in the SPE. In
January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”
(“FIN 46”). FIN 46 clarifies that companies
may need to consolidate certain entities in which equity
investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling
financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for
the entity to finance its activities without additional
subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46
applies immediately to variable interest entities created or in
which an enterprise obtains an interest after January 31,
2003. For variable interest entities created before
February 1, 2003, FIN 46 is applicable in the first
fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15,
2003. Accordingly, MasterCard intends to adopt FIN 46 for the
quarter ending September 30, 2003, which will most likely
require MasterCard to consolidate its SPE. The impact of
consolidating the SPE is discussed in detail in Note 12.

Revenue
recognition

— The
Company’s revenue is comprised of operations fees and
assessments. Certain revenues are estimated based upon aggregate
transaction information provided by MasterCard International
members.

Operations fees represent fees for authorization,
clearing, settlement and other products and services that
facilitate transaction and information management among the
Company’s customers on a global basis. These fees are
generally recognized as revenue in the same period as the
related transactions occur or services are rendered. The Company
also sells holograms, paper warning bulletins, manuals and
publications. Revenue from these items is recognized when sales
are completed. Operations fees also include foreign exchange net
gains on settlement activities.

Assessments predominantly represent payments made
by members of MasterCard International with respect to their
card programs carrying the marks of one or more of the brands
within the MasterCard family of brands, principally the
MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus brands. Assessments are based
principally upon daily, monthly or quarterly gross dollar
volumes (“GDV”), which represent gross usage (purchase
and cash disbursements) on MasterCard-branded cards for goods
and services, including balance transfers and convenience
checks. Assessments are generally recorded as revenue in the
period they are earned, which is when the related GDV is
generated on the cards. Assessments are based on
management’s estimate of the customers’ performance in
a given period and actual results may differ from these
estimates.

MasterCard has business agreements with certain
customers that provide for fee rebates when the customers meet
certain hurdles. Such rebates are generally calculated on a
monthly basis based upon estimated performance and the
contracted discount rates for the services provided, and are
recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period as the
revenue is earned. Rebates are based on management’s
estimate of the customers’ performance in a given period
and actual results may differ from these estimates.

In addition, MasterCard enters into agreements
with certain customers to provide volume-based and support
incentives that are recorded as a reduction of revenue in
accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
Issue No. 01-9, “Accounting for Consideration Given by
a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the
Vendor’s Products)” (“EITF 01-9”). On
January 1, 2002, MasterCard implemented EITF 01-9
which resulted in certain payments to customers and merchants
previously classified as advertising and market development
expense being reclassified as a reduction of revenue. The
amounts of such



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share
data)

consideration were $167 million and
$127 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and
2000, respectively. Incentives are based on management’s
estimate of the customer’s performance, as detailed in the
agreements, in a given period and actual results may differ from
these estimates.

Cash and cash
equivalents

— Cash and cash
equivalents include certain highly liquid investments with a
maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase. Cash
equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.

Restricted security deposits held for
MasterCard International
members

— MasterCard
requires and holds security deposits from certain members of
MasterCard International in order to maintain collateral for
settlement of their transactions. These assets are fully offset
by corresponding liabilities included in the consolidated
balance sheets.

Investment securities —

The Company classifies debt securities
as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale and classifies equity
securities as trading.

Debt securities are classified as
held-to-maturity when the Company has the positive intent and
ability to hold the debt securities to maturity.
Held-to-maturity securities are stated at amortized cost. Debt
securities that are not held-to-maturity are classified as
available-for-sale. Debt securities available-for-sale are
carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net
of applicable taxes, recorded as a separate component of
accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated
statements of comprehensive income. Quoted market values, when
available, are used to determine the fair value of debt
securities. The specific identification method is used to
determine realized gains and losses. Net realized gains and
losses on debt securities are recognized in other income and
expense on the consolidated statements of income.

Equity securities bought and held primarily for
sale in the near term are classified as trading and are reported
at fair value. Quoted market values, when available, are used to
determine the fair value of trading securities. The
Company’s trading securities are publicly traded and are
related to an executive compensation plan. Net realized and
unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are recognized
in other income and expense on the consolidated statements of
income. The specific identification method is used to determine
realized gains and losses. To the extent these securities have
appreciated over their original cost, a corresponding offset is
recorded in general and administrative expense in connection
with the executive compensation plan.

Settlement due to/due from
members

— The Company
operates systems for clearing and settling payment transactions
among MasterCard International members. Net settlements are
generally cleared daily among members by wire transfer or other
bank clearing means. However, some transactions may not settle
until subsequent business days, resulting in amounts due from
and due to MasterCard International members.

Property, plant and
equipment

— Property, plant
and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Depreciation on equipment and furniture and
fixtures is calculated under the straight-line method over the
related estimated useful lives of the assets, generally ranging
from two to five years. Amortization of leasehold improvements
is calculated under the straight-line method, using the lesser
of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the terms
of the related leases. Capital leases are amortized under the
straight-line method, over the lives of the leases. Depreciation
on buildings is calculated under the straight-line method over
an estimated useful life of 30 years.

Goodwill

—
Goodwill represents the excess of cost over net assets acquired
in connection with the acquisition of certain businesses.
Beginning January 1, 2002, in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
(“SFAS 142”), goodwill amortization ceased. Prior
to January 1, 2002, goodwill was amortized, under the
straight-line method over the related useful life of
20 years.



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share
data)

Intangible
assets

— Intangible assets
consist of capitalized software costs, franchise rights,
trademarks, tradenames and other intangible assets which have
finite lives, and customer relationships, which have indefinite
lives. Beginning on January 1, 2002, SFAS 142 required
intangible assets with finite useful lives to be amortized over
their useful lives.

Capitalized software, which includes internal and
external costs incurred in developing or obtaining computer
software for internal use, is capitalized in other intangible
assets in the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with
Statement of Position 98-1, “Accounting for the Costs
of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal
Use” and related guidance. Development costs are expensed
during the preliminary project management phase until it is
probable that the project will be completed and the software
will be used to perform the function intended. Thereafter, all
qualifying direct internal and external costs related to the
design, development and testing phase are capitalized, and upon
the project being substantially complete and ready for its
intended use, are amortized using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful life of the software, not to exceed three
years. Costs related to post-implementation activities for
software that is developed or purchased for internal use are
expensed as incurred.

Impairment

—
Management evaluates the recoverability of assets, specifically
investments in affiliates, investment securities, goodwill,
intangible and long-lived assets.

Derivative financial
instruments

— Effective
January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities” (“SFAS 133”). SFAS 133, as
amended and



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share
data)

interpreted, establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments, including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for
hedging activities. SFAS 133 requires that all derivatives,
whether designated in hedging relationships or not, be recorded
on the balance sheet at fair value in other assets and other
liabilities, regardless of the purpose or intent for holding
them.

Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is
highly effective and that is designated and qualifies as a
foreign-currency cash flow hedge are recorded in other
comprehensive income until earnings are affected by the
variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction (e.g., until
periodic settlements of a variable-rate asset or liability are
recorded in earnings). Any hedge ineffectiveness (which
represents the amount by which the changes in the fair value of
the derivative exceeds the variability in the cash flows of the
forecasted transaction) is recorded in current-period earnings.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments which are
foreign currency fair value hedges or which do not qualify for
hedge accounting under SFAS 133 are reported in current-period
earnings.

The Company formally documents all relationships
between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its
risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various
hedge transactions for all derivatives which qualify for hedge
accounting under SFAS 133. This process includes linking all
derivatives that are designated as foreign-currency cash flow
hedges to forecasted transactions. The Company also formally
assesses (both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing
basis) whether the derivatives that are used in hedging
transactions have been highly effective in offsetting changes in
the fair value or cash flows of hedged items and whether those
derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future
periods. When it is determined that a derivative is not (or has
ceased to be) highly effective as a hedge, the Company
discontinues hedge accounting prospectively, as discussed below.

The Company discontinues hedge accounting
prospectively when (1) it determines that the derivative is
no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a
hedged item; (2) the derivative expires or is sold,
terminated, or exercised; (3) it is no longer probable that
the forecasted transaction will occur; or (4) management
determines that designating the derivative as a hedging
instrument is no longer appropriate.

When the Company discontinues hedge accounting
because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction
will occur in the originally expected period, the gain or loss
on the derivative remains in accumulated other comprehensive
income and is reclassified into earnings when the forecasted
transaction affects earnings. However, if it is probable that a
forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the
originally specified time period or within an additional month
thereafter, the gains and losses that were accumulated in other
comprehensive income will be recognized immediately in earnings.
In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and
the derivative remains outstanding, the Company will carry the
derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet, recognizing
changes in the fair value in current-period earnings.

Income
Taxes

— The Company provides
for income taxes under the provisions of SFAS No. 109
“Accounting for Income Taxes.” SFAS No. 109
requires an asset and liability based approach in accounting for
income taxes.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future years of
temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts and income tax bases of assets and liabilities.
Valuation allowances are provided against assets which are not
likely to be realized.

Foreign currency
translation

— The U.S.
dollar is the functional currency for the majority of the
Company’s businesses except for MasterCard Europe’s
operations for which the functional currency is the euro. Where
the U.S. dollar is considered the functional currency, monetary
assets and liabilities are remeasured to U.S. dollars using
current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date;
non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical
exchange rates; and revenue and expense accounts are



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share
data)

remeasured at a weighted average exchange rate
for the period. Resulting exchange gains and losses are included
in net income. For MasterCard Europe, translation from the euro
to U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using
current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and
for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average
exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments
are reported as a component of other comprehensive income.

Pension and other postretirement
plans

— The compensation
cost of an employee’s pension benefit is recognized on the
projected unit credit method over the employee’s
approximate service period. The aggregate cost method is
utilized for funding purposes. The expected return on plan
assets is based on a calculated asset value.

Advertising
expense

— The cost of media
advertising is generally expensed when the advertising takes
place. Production costs are expensed as costs are incurred.
Promotional items are expensed at the time the promotional event
occurs.

Legal
fees

— MasterCard accrues
legal costs that are expected to be incurred to defend
MasterCard in certain litigation discussed in Note 14. The
accruals are estimated based on management’s expectations
of foreseeable costs after consultation with outside counsel,
which are assessed in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 5, “Accounting for
Contingencies.” This policy has been applied since the
commencement of certain litigation discussed in Note 14.

Net income per
share

— MasterCard computes
basic and diluted net income per share by dividing net income
applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding for the period.

Note 3.     Net
Income Per Share

The following table sets forth the computation of
basic and diluted net income per share:

Note
4.     Conversion to a Stock Company
and Acquisition of EPI

Conversion

On June 28, 2002, pursuant to an Agreement
and Plan of Merger dated as of February 13, 2002,
MasterCard International merged with a subsidiary of MasterCard
Incorporated (the “Conversion”). In the Conversion,
each principal member of MasterCard International received
shares of class A redeemable common stock and class B
convertible common stock of MasterCard Incorporated,
representing that member’s equity interest in the Company.
Additionally, each principal member of MasterCard International
received a class A membership interest in MasterCard
International, representing that member’s continued rights
as a licensee to use MasterCard’s brands, programs,
products and services. MasterCard Incorporated owns the sole
class B membership interest in MasterCard International,
entitling MasterCard Incorporated to exercise all economic
rights and substantially all voting rights in MasterCard
International. MasterCard International is the Company’s
principal operating subsidiary.



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share
data)

In connection with the Conversion, MasterCard
acquired, directly and indirectly, 100% of the shares of EPI not
previously owned by MasterCard International pursuant to a Share
Exchange and Integration Agreement, dated as of
February 13, 2002, entered into by MasterCard, MasterCard
International and EPI (the “Integration Agreement”).
EPI, now MasterCard Europe, is the Company’s principal
operating subsidiary in Europe.

The authorized capital stock of MasterCard
consists of 275,000 shares of class A redeemable common stock,
par value $.01 per share (of which 84,000 shares are issued and
outstanding); 25,000 shares of class B convertible common stock,
par value $.01 per share (of which 16,000 shares are issued and
outstanding); and 75,000 shares of class C common stock, par
value $.01 per share (of which no shares are issued or
outstanding).

If a stockholder of MasterCard Incorporated
ceases to be a principal member of MasterCard International
before July 1, 2005, the common stock will be redeemed at
par value. After July 1, 2005, MasterCard may, at its
option, redeem the common stock of a stockholder that ceases to
be a principal member of MasterCard International for the book
value of the shares, based on MasterCard’s financial
statements most recently filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

If MasterCard does not redeem the
stockholder’s shares, a stockholder ceasing to be a member
of MasterCard International after July 1, 2005 will be
required to offer the unredeemed shares to the other
stockholders of MasterCard Incorporated in accordance with
procedures to be established by the board of directors.

Under the terms of the Integration Agreement,
class B convertible common stock will automatically be converted
into class A redeemable common stock on or about July 1,
2005, except for certain class B shares attributable to the ec
Pictogram brand in Europe (“ec Picto shares’). In
accordance with the Integration Agreement, the class A shares
will then be reallocated among the stockholders of MasterCard
Incorporated on that date. The ec Picto shares will
automatically be converted into shares of class A redeemable
common stock and reallocated on or about July 1, 2007, in
accordance with the terms of the Integration Agreement.

Class C common stock may be issued from time
to time with voting powers, designations, preferences and other
rights to be determined by the MasterCard board of directors, in
compliance with certain limitations, set forth in the
certificate of incorporation of MasterCard Incorporated.

Transfer of shares of common stock and assignment
of the right to receive shares is not permitted, except under
specific circumstances, until July 1, 2005. After
July 1, 2005, each stockholder must maintain an ownership
percentage of common stock that is no less than 75% and no more
than 125% of the most recent global proxy calculation, as
described in the Integration Agreement. Stockholders may be
required to purchase or sell shares of MasterCard in order to
satisfy these requirements within 12 months of receipt of
notice from MasterCard that such purchase or sale is required.

Acquisition of EPI
(“Integration”)

In connection with the Integration Agreement,
each shareholder of EPI (other than MasterCard International and
MasterCard Europay U.K. Limited (“MEPUK”)) was
required to enter into a separate share exchange agreement with
MasterCard Incorporated and MasterCard International, pursuant
to which it exchanged its EPI shares for a specified number of
shares of class A redeemable common stock and class B
convertible common stock of MasterCard Incorporated. In
addition, the shareholders of MEPUK were required to enter into
an agreement with MasterCard Incorporated pursuant to which they
exchanged their MEPUK shares for a specified number of shares of
class A redeemable common stock and class B convertible common
stock of MasterCard Incorporated. As a result of the
Integration, EPI and MEPUK became wholly-owned subsidiaries of
MasterCard Incorporated. At the time of the Integration,
MEPUK’s sole asset was

certain shares of EPI. MasterCard International
and MEPUK continue to hold shares of EPI (now MasterCard Europe).

MasterCard Europe’s primary business is to
license a full range of payment programs and services to
financial institutions in the European region and to provide a
sophisticated set of information processing and transaction
delivery services to these institutions. The Integration has
allowed MasterCard International and MasterCard Europe to form
an integrated, global payments company with a single management
team and governance structure that is better able to address
customer needs.

The results of EPI’s operations have been
included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company
from June 28, 2002.

Purchase Price for EPI

MasterCard Incorporated issued 23.76 million
shares to the shareholders of EPI and MEPUK in the Integration,
in return for directly and indirectly acquiring 100% of the
shares of EPI not previously owned by MasterCard International.
However, of the 23.76 million shares issued, only
17.61 million were considered to be issued unconditionally.
As discussed more fully below, the purchase price for EPI was
based on the estimated value of the unconditional shares only,
and this estimated value was determined on the basis of an
independent valuation. Considering this valuation and the
17.61 million unconditional shares issued, the purchase
price of EPI was $267,856, excluding estimated acquisition costs
of $10,486 that were incurred by the Company. A change in
estimate which increased acquisition costs resulted in a
corresponding increase to goodwill of $190 subsequent to the
date of the acquisition of EPI.

In calculating the purchase price of EPI, the
Company considered only the unconditional shares issued to the
former shareholders of EPI and MEPUK because the Integration
Agreement provides that the number of shares allocated to these
shareholders will potentially increase or decrease at the end of
a three-year transition period as a result of the application of
a global proxy formula for the third year of the transition
period. Of the 23.76 million shares attributable to the
exchange of EPI and MEPUK shares, 6.15 million shares are
conditional shares subject to reallocation at the end of the
transition period and allocable to EPI and MEPUK shareholders.
EPI and MEPUK shareholders therefore received 17.61 million
unconditional shares at closing.

Since former EPI and MEPUK shareholders would
retain or receive additional shares of MasterCard Incorporated
at the end of the transition period without remitting any
additional consideration, any shares retained or received by
them that are above their minimum allocation at that time would
constitute a part of the purchase price. Any such additional
shares would be valued at that time based upon the fair value of
the stock of MasterCard Incorporated. Any such reallocation of
shares to former EPI and MEPUK shareholders will increase the
purchase price for EPI and, accordingly, the amount of goodwill
and additional paid-in capital recorded.

Fair Value of EPI Assets Acquired and
Liabilities Assumed

The following table summarizes the estimated fair
values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at
June 28, 2002, the date of the acquisition of EPI in the
Integration, as determined based on an independent appraisal,
and also reflects subsequent refinements to the estimated fair
values through December 31, 2002. As the fair values are
estimates, the allocation of the purchase price is subject to
refinement while MasterCard finalizes the estimated valuation of
certain intangible assets and finalizes plans and assumptions
relating to certain exit cost liabilities. Certain balances for
assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been reclassified
to conform with MasterCard presentation for consistency:

Subsequent to the acquisition date of EPI, the
purchase price allocation was refined and amounts were
reallocated to goodwill and the corresponding assets acquired
and liabilities assumed. These refinements are included in the
table above. Note 7 provides a summary of $4,111 of
refinements to goodwill subsequent to the original purchase
price allocation. The estimated values of certain capitalized
software technologies were reduced by $4,911 after the values of
the assets were finalized. Exit costs relating to the
Integration increased by $2,041, of which $703 was reallocated
to current liabilities and $1,338 was reallocated to other
liabilities as discussed below. Deferred income taxes were
reduced by $2,840 as a result of these changes in estimate.

Of the $182,241 of acquired intangible assets
(see Note 8) $27,753 was allocated to capitalized software
and $10,795 was allocated to trademarks and tradenames. Both of
these asset classes have a weighted average useful life of
approximately three years and are amortized on a straight-line
basis. In addition, $143,693 was allocated to customer
relationships that have an indefinite useful life. Goodwill (see
Note 7) and other intangible assets with indefinite lives
are not subject to amortization. Goodwill is not tax deductible.

Pursuant to the Integration Agreement, the bylaws
of MasterCard International adopted on June 28, 2002
provide that the Company will assume the first $7,000 of losses
or liabilities that relate to any breach of EPI’s
representations or warranties in the Integration Agreement; any
such losses or liabilities in excess of $7,000 could, under
MasterCard International’s bylaws, be levied against
MasterCard International’s European members as an
assessment. MasterCard anticipates that certain former EPI
liabilities could trigger this bylaw provision. The $7,000 is
included in total liabilities assumed above.

Exit Costs Relating to the
Integration

Included in the total liabilities assumed above
are preliminary estimates of exit costs relating to the
Integration. A rollforward of the liability for exit costs is
summarized as follows:

A change in estimate which increased the
preliminary estimate of exit costs relating to the Integration
resulted in a corresponding increase to goodwill and deferred
taxes subsequent to the date of the acquisition of EPI. Exit
costs relating to redundant computer systems/technology
elimination were increased by $2,583 to reflect external
consulting services in excess of the preliminary estimate. The
workforce reduction liability was decreased by $542 due to the
redeployment of certain employees.

Pro Forma Results of Operations

The unaudited pro forma results of operations for
the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, as if EPI had
been combined as of January 1, 2001, are as follows:

Note 7.     Goodwill

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill
for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 are as
follows (see Note 4):

The acquisition of the minority interest in
Mondex International, Ltd. (“MXI”) during 2001
resulted in approximately $3,103 of goodwill. The Company
performed an impairment analysis and concluded that the MXI
goodwill was fully impaired based on projected cash flows. An
impairment charge of $3,103 for MXI was recorded in general and
administrative expense on the consolidated statements of income
for the year ended December 31, 2001.

Changes in the estimate of exit costs relating to
the Integration resulted in a goodwill increase of $1,221, net
of tax. Exit costs relating to redundant computer
systems/technology were increased to reflect external consulting
services in excess of the preliminary estimate. Additionally,
exit costs relating to the workforce reduction liability were
decreased due to the redeployment of certain employees. Changes
in the estimate of acquisition costs for EPI resulted in a
goodwill increase of $190 to reflect actual acquisition costs
incurred. The preliminary estimates of certain capitalized
software technologies were reduced after the values of the
assets were finalized, which resulted in a $2,890 increase, net
of tax, to goodwill to reflect the change in the estimated
purchase price allocation.

Note 8.     Other
Intangible Assets

The following table sets forth net intangible
assets, other than goodwill:

Amortization and impairment expense on the assets
above amounted to the following:

The impairment charge of $6,370 and $891 during
2002 and 2001, respectively, primarily resulted from the
decision to discontinue the use of certain technology. The
Company performed an impairment analysis on the related
technology licenses and concluded that the carrying value of
these assets was in excess of fair value. Fair value was
estimated as zero due to discontinued future use. Impairment
charges were recorded in general and administrative on the
accompanying consolidated statements of income for each of the
years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000.

During 2001 and 2000, the Company evaluated the
recoverability of certain franchise rights and recorded
impairment charges of $3,224 and $8,609, respectively.
Government restrictions and slower than expected development in
certain countries limited future cash streams in the foreseeable
future. As a result, the Company adjusted the carrying value of
franchise rights associated with its consolidated subsidiaries
Mondex Asia, Mondex China and Mondex India to the estimated net
present value of future cash flows from those entities. On
December 20, 2001, Mondex Asia sold franchise rights with a
carrying value of $1,100 for $1,100. At December 31, 2001,
the entire remaining balance of shareholder franchise rights had
been fully amortized, impaired or sold.

Note 9.     Pension,
Savings Plan and Other Benefits

The Company has a noncontributory defined benefit
pension plan covering substantially all of its U.S. employees.
Effective January 1, 2000, the Company converted this plan
from a final average pay plan to a cash balance plan. The cash
balance plan credits participants annually with an amount equal
to a percentage of eligible pay based on age and service, as
well as providing earnings credits based on each
participant’s account balance. The company also then
established an unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan
that provides certain key employees with supplemental retirement
benefits in excess of limits on qualified plans by federal tax
laws.

In 2001, the Company eliminated the early
retirement supplement under the cash balance plan, which
provided supplemental monthly benefits provided that certain
criteria were met.

On June 28, 2002, in connection with its
acquisition of MasterCard Europe, the Company assumed a defined
benefit plan covering substantially all employees affiliated
with MasterCard Europe. On December 31, 2002, the Company
settled its benefit obligations and terminated the plan. All
excess assets will be transferred to a new defined contribution
plan.

Net pension periodic cost (benefit) included the
following components for the years ended December 31, 2002,
2001, and 2000. The U.S. plans include both the cash balance
plan and the unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan.

The net periodic cost (benefit) was recorded as a
component of general and administrative expense in the
consolidated statements of income for the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000.

The projected benefit obligation, the accumulated
benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the cash
balance plan were $97,625, $84,839 and $63,727, respectively, as
of December 31, 2001. The cash balance plan’s assets
exceeded its accumulated benefit obligation as of
December 31, 2002.

The projected benefit obligation and the
accumulated benefit obligation for the unfunded supplemental
executive retirement plan were $5,005 and $4,452, respectively,
as of December 31, 2002 and $3,106 and $2,781,
respectively, as of December 31, 2001.

The majority of the Company’s employees are
eligible to participate in a defined contribution savings plan
sponsored by the Company. The plan allows employees to
contribute a portion of their base compensation on a pre-tax and
after-tax basis in accordance with specified guidelines. The
Company matches a percentage of employee contributions up to
certain limits. The Company’s contribution aggregated
$24,285, $19,905 and $17,180 for 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. Participating employees can invest contributions
among several fund alternatives.

The Company has a Value Appreciation Program
(“VAP”), which is a frozen incentive plan established
in 1995. Annual awards were granted to VAP participants from
1995 through 1998, which entitled participants to the net
appreciation on a portfolio of securities of MasterCard members.
Participants vest at a rate of 20% each year. If a participant
is not fully vested and redeems his or her shares, appreciation
is forfeited and returned to MasterCard. In 1999, the VAP was
replaced by an Executive Incentive Plan (“EIP”).
Although contributions to the VAP have been discontinued, plan
assets remain intact and participants are entitled to the net
appreciation on the portfolio of securities in accordance with
plan provisions. The Company’s liability related to the VAP
at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $5,026 and $9,582,
respectively, and the (income)/expense was ($3,854), ($6,114)
and $499 for the years ending December 31, 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively.

MasterCard’s EIP is a performance unit plan,
in which participants receive grants of units with a target
value contingent on the achievement of the Company’s
long-term performance goals. Performance unit awards are paid in
the form of cash over a 5-year vesting period. The end value of
the units will vary based upon the level of performance
achieved. Employees who are designated Senior Vice President or
higher by March 31st of the calendar year are eligible for
participation in any performance period, provided they have met
certain performance criteria. The Compensation Committee and/or
the President and Chief Executive Officer also have discretion
to designate other employees as eligible to participate in the
plan.

Performance units are granted under the EIP with
an actual value that will be calculated based on the
Company’s performance over a three-year period. Each unit
is valued at threshold ($50), target ($100) or maximum ($200)
if, on a weighted-average basis, threshold, target or maximum
performance is achieved for all of the performance measures. The
value of the units are increased or decreased on a straight-line
basis. The units are not valued if performance is below the
threshold. The performance units vest over three- and five-year
periods. Upon completion of the three-year performance period,
participants receive a payment equal to 80% of the award earned.
The remaining 20% of the award is paid upon completion of two
additional years of service. The Company’s liability
related to EIP at December 31, 2002 and December 31,
2001 was $85,551 and $76,135, respectively, and the expense was
$36,545, $31,536 and $29,682 for the years ending
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Both the VAP and the EIP are accounted for in
accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 28,
“Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other
Variable Stock Option of Award Plans”
(“FIN 28”). In accordance with FIN 28,
compensation is accrued as a charge to expense over the periods
the employee performs the related services.

Note
10.     Postretirement Health and Life
Insurance Benefits

Prior to 2001, MasterCard maintained a combined
defined benefit/defined contribution postretirement benefit plan
for retirees that included healthcare benefits and life
insurance benefits. However, certain participants were
grandfathered and received full medical and life insurance
benefits.

In 2001, MasterCard modified certain provisions
of its postretirement plan based on certain business objectives.
The new plan better aligns with the Company’s cash balance
pension plan by providing annual contributions for medical
benefits based upon employee service. The new program does not
alter benefits applicable to grandfathered participants.

In adopting SFAS No. 106,
“Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions,” MasterCard elected to defer and
amortize the $11,592 transition obligation through the year 2013.

The following table presents the status of the
Company’s postretirement benefit plan at December 31:

At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the accrued
benefit cost was recorded on the consolidated balance sheets
within other long-term liabilities.

The Company assumed an annual increase in the per

2003, declining gradually to 5.5% by 2006 and remaining level
thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a
significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care
plans. A one-percentage point change in assumed health care cost
trend rates would have the following effects:

Note 11.

Debt

In June 2002, MasterCard International entered a
364-day revolving credit facility (the “Credit
Facility”) with certain financial institutions that expires
on June 3, 2003. The purpose of the Credit Facility is to
provide liquidity in the event of one or more settlement
failures by MasterCard International members. The Credit
Facility replaced MasterCard International’s $1,200,000
credit facility under a 364-day revolving credit agreement that
expired June 4, 2002. Under the terms of the Credit
Facility, MasterCard International has commitments of $1,200,000
which can be borrowed in the form of revolving loans. Interest
is charged at the London Interbank Offered Rate
(“LIBOR”) plus 28 basis points, and the rate
increases depending upon the amount of any draw down. Under the
Credit Facility, MasterCard International also agreed to pay a
facility fee equal to 7 basis points per annum on each
lender’s commitment. MasterCard International has also
agreed to pay upfront fees of $434 and administrative fees of
$209, which are being amortized straight-line over one year.
Facility and other fees associated with this credit facility
totaled $1,636, $1,513 and $1,279 for each of the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. On August 1, 2002,
the borrower under the facility was converted from MasterCard
International to MasterCard Incorporated. MasterCard was in
compliance with the facility covenants as of December 31,
2002 and was in compliance with the covenants for the previous
facility at December 31, 2001. There were no borrowings
under the facility at December 31, 2002. On
September 11, 2001, MasterCard drew down the entire line
for one day as a precautionary measure and repaid it on the
following day, with minimal financial impact.

In June 1998, MasterCard International issued
ten-year unsecured, subordinated notes (the “Notes”)
paying a fixed interest rate of 6.67% per annum. The terms of
the Notes require MasterCard to repay the principal amount on
June 30, 2008. The Company has the option to prepay the
Notes with a “make whole” payment to the investors if
market interest rates are lower at the time of prepayment. The
interest on the Notes was $5,336 for each of the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. The Company was in
compliance with the covenants of the Notes as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001. The principal amount of the



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share

Notes outstanding at December 31, 2002 and
2001 was $80,000. The fair value of the Notes is estimated at
$88,581 and $80,418 at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

In October 1993, MasterCard Europe and European
Payment System Services sprl, a subsidiary of MasterCard,
entered into a multi-purpose unsecured credit facility with a
bank to satisfy certain operational funding requirements. The
final amendment of this agreement, dated October 1999, allows
for funding for a period of up to twelve months from the
borrowing date for a maximum amount of 35,000 euros. The
credit facility can be used for overnight overdrafts, intraday
overdrafts, straight loans, and guarantees. This agreement
requires the payment of interest at varying rates. For a
straight loan, drawdown interest is paid at the Euro Interbank
Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) plus 15 basis points.
For overdrafts on euro accounts and U.S. dollar accounts,
interest is paid at a rate of the Euro Overnight Index Average
(“EONIA”) plus 50 basis points and the
U.S. dollar call rate plus 50 basis points,
respectively. To cover overdrafts, the bank will automatically
activate the credit facility. For bank guarantees, the guarantee
fee is paid at a rate of 1.5% per annum. At December 31,
2002, the facility supported 13 bank-issued guarantees for
a total of 608 euros, which reduced the amount of funds
available under the facility. From time to time, the Company may
convert the borrowing to a straight loan. There were no
borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2002.

In February 2001, MasterCard Europe entered into
an unsecured credit agreement with a bank to provide fixed-term
financing to fund certain settlement service operations for up
to 30,000 euros. This agreement allows for borrowings to be
outstanding for a period of seven to thirty days. Under this
agreement, interest is paid at EURIBOR plus 15 basis points. The
rates of interest are set at the current market rate, and the
bank at its discretion can modify the offered margins to reflect
market conditions. There were no borrowings under this facility
at December 31, 2002.

In September 2002, MasterCard Europe increased
its credit facility with a separate bank from 10,000 euros
to 100,000 euros to cover multi-currency overdrafts. The
interest rate under this facility is Euro LIBOR plus
50 basis points per annum for amounts below 100,000 euros
and Euro LIBOR plus 250 basis points for amounts over the
100,000 euro limit. For drawings in currencies other than
the euro, interest will be charged at the above margins over the
relevant currency base rate. There were no borrowings under this
facility at December 31, 2002.

From time to time, the Company has temporary
overdrafts at banks due to timing differences related to
settlement or corporate activity. At December 31, 2001 and
2000 there were net cash account overdraft positions of $9,531
and $4,088, respectively, which have been recorded in other
current liabilities. The Company had no overdrafts at
December 31, 2002.

Note 12.

Commitments and Contingent
    Liabilities

On August 31, 1999, MasterCard International
entered into a ten-year synthetic lease agreement for a global
technology and operations center located in O’Fallon,
Missouri, called Winghaven. The lessor under the lease agreement
is MasterCard International O’Fallon 1999 Trust (the
“Trust”), which is the SPE referenced in Note 2.
The Trust financed the operations center through a combination
of a third party equity investment and the issuance of
7.36 percent Series A Senior Secured Notes (the
“Secured Notes”) in the amount of $149,380. Rent is
payable in amounts equal to interest payments on the Secured
Notes and any returns to equity-holders. In conjunction with the
lease agreement, MasterCard International executed a guarantee
of 85.15 percent of the Secured Notes outstanding totaling
$127,197 at December 31, 2002. Additionally, upon the
occurrence of specific events of default, MasterCard
International will guarantee repayment of the total outstanding
principal and interest on the Secured Notes and take ownership
of the facility. The lease agreement permits MasterCard
International to purchase the facility upon 180 days notice
at a purchase price equal to the aggregate outstanding principal
amount of the Secured Notes, including any accrued and unpaid
interest and investor equity, along with any accrued and unpaid
amounts due to the investor under the lease

agreement after August 31, 2006. At
December 31, 2002, the impact of consolidating the SPE on
MasterCard’s consolidated balance sheets would result in
recording $154,000 in assets, $149,380 in debt and $4,620 of
minority interest relating to the equity in the Trust held by a
third party. For the year ended December 31, 2002, there
would have been no impact on net income. However, interest
income, interest expense and minority interest would have been
increased by equal and offsetting amounts.

Global rental expense for the Company’s
office space aggregated approximately $25,651, $22,110 and
$16,254 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively. Lease expense for automobiles, computer
equipment, and office equipment aggregated $2,484, $2,537 and
$3,105 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively.

The future minimum payments under non-cancelable
operating leases for office buildings and equipment,
sponsorships, licensing and other agreements at
December 31, 2002 are as follows:

before income taxes and foreign operations resulted in income
before income taxes of approximately $6,548.



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

The provision for income taxes differs from the
amount of income tax determined by applying the appropriate
statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to pretax income for
the years ended December 31, as a result of the following:

The decrease in the effective tax rate is
attributable to several items, some of which are not expected to
recur. In December, 2002 the Belgium statutory tax rate was
reduced from 40.2% to 34.0%. As a result, deferred income tax
liabilities established in connection with the acquisition of
MasterCard Europe were revalued based on the lower Belgian
income tax rate. In addition, we anticipate settling certain tax
examinations on a favorable basis. The effective rate was
further decreased by a change in the geographic distribution of
pretax income from jurisdictions with higher state tax rates to
those with lower rates. Furthermore, the Company realized
significant foreign tax credits relating to prior periods. The
benefits of these items in lowering the effective tax rate were
partially offset by a one-time increase in state income tax
expense attributable to the revaluation of deferred state tax as
a result of lower state tax rates.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the
expected future tax consequences of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and
liabilities. The net deferred tax assets (liabilities) at
December 31 are comprised of the following:

The valuation allowance relates to the ability to
recognize tax benefits associated with the Company’s
foreign operations and capital loss carry forwards. The
valuation allowance was $8,339 at December 31, 2000. The
valuation allowance increased in years in which additional
foreign losses and capital losses were incurred but tax benefits
could not be recognized and decreased in years in which losses
were recognized.

Note 14.     Legal
Proceedings

MasterCard is a party to legal proceedings with
respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of
business. Except as described below, MasterCard does not believe
that any legal proceedings to which it is a party would have a
material adverse impact on its business or prospects. MasterCard
believes that it is not currently possible to estimate the
impact, if any, that the ultimate resolution of these matters
will have on its results of operations, financial position or
cash flows and as such, consistent with Financial Accounting
Standards No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”,
no accrual has been made.

Department of Justice Antitrust
Litigation

In October 1998, the United States Department of
Justice (“DOJ”) filed suit against MasterCard
International, Visa U.S.A., Inc. and Visa International Corp. in
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York
alleging that both MasterCard’s and Visa’s governance
structure and policies violated U.S. federal antitrust laws.
First, the DOJ claimed that “dual governance” —
the situation where a financial institution has a representative
on the board of directors of MasterCard or Visa while a portion
of its card portfolio is issued under the brand of the other
association — was anti-competitive and acted to limit
innovation within the payment card industry. At the same time,
the DOJ conceded that “dual issuance” — a term
describing the structure of the bank card industry in the United
States in which a single financial institution can issue both
MasterCard and Visa-branded cards — was pro-competitive.
Second, the DOJ challenged MasterCard’s Competitive
Programs Policy (“CPP”) and a Visa bylaw provision
that prohibit financial institutions participating in the
respective associations from issuing competing proprietary
payment cards (such as American Express or Discover). The DOJ
alleged that MasterCard’s CPP and Visa’s bylaw
provision acted to restrain competition.

MasterCard denied the DOJ’s allegations.
MasterCard believes that both “dual governance” and
the CPP are pro-competitive and fully consistent with U.S.
federal antitrust law.

A bench trial concerning the DOJ’s
allegations was concluded on August 22, 2000. On
October 9, 2001, the district court judge issued an opinion
upholding the legality and pro-competitive nature of dual
governance. In so doing, the judge specifically found that
MasterCard and Visa have competed vigorously over the years,
that prices to consumers have dropped dramatically, and that
MasterCard has fostered rapid innovations in systems, product
offerings and services.

However, the judge also held that
MasterCard’s CPP and the Visa bylaw constitute unlawful
restraints of trade under the federal antitrust laws. The judge
found that the CPP and Visa bylaw weakened competition and
harmed consumers by preventing competing proprietary payment
card networks such as American Express and Discover from
entering into agreements with banks to issue cards on their
networks. In reaching this decision, the judge found that two
distinct markets — a credit and charge card issuing market
and a network services market — existed in the United
States, and that both MasterCard and Visa had market power in
the network market. MasterCard strongly disputes these findings
and believes that the DOJ failed, among other things, to
demonstrate that U.S. consumers have been harmed by the CPP.

On November 26, 2001, the judge issued a
final judgment that orders MasterCard to repeal the CPP insofar
as it applies to issuers and enjoins MasterCard from enacting or
enforcing any bylaw, rule, policy or practice that prohibits its
issuers from issuing general purpose credit or debit cards in
the United States on any other general purpose card network. The
judge also concluded that during the period in which the CPP was
in effect, MasterCard was able to “lock up” certain
members by entering into long-term agreements with them



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share
data)

pursuant to which the members committed to
maintain a certain percentage of their general purpose card
volume, new card issuance or total number of cards in force in
the United States on MasterCard’s network. Accordingly, the
final judgment provides that there will be a period (commencing
on the effective date of the judgment and ending on the later of
two years from that date or two years from the resolution of any
final appeal) during which MasterCard will be required to permit
any issuer with which it entered into such an agreement prior to
the effective date of the final judgment to terminate that
agreement without penalty, provided that the reason for the
termination is to permit the issuer to enter into an agreement
with American Express or Discover. MasterCard would be free to
apply to the district court to recover funds paid but not yet
earned under any terminated agreement. The final judgment
imposes parallel requirements on Visa. The judge explicitly
provided that MasterCard and Visa would be free to enter into
new partnership or member business agreements in the future.

MasterCard believes that it has a strong legal
basis to challenge the judge’s ruling with respect to the
CPP, and has appealed the decision on that count. On
February 6, 2002, the judge issued an order granting
MasterCard’s and Visa’s motion to stay the final
judgment pending appeal. MasterCard, the DOJ and other parties
to the DOJ antitrust litigation completed their submission of
appellate briefs to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in late
August 2002, and presently are awaiting a date for oral argument
on the appeal of the U.S. District Court’s decision in this
case. MasterCard believes that it is not currently possible to
estimate the impact, if any, that the ultimate resolution of
this matter will have on MasterCard’s results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.

Merchant Antitrust Litigation

Commencing in October 1996, several class action
suits were brought by a number of U.S. merchants —
including Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Sears Roebuck & Co., Inc.,
The Limited Inc. and Safeway, Inc. — against MasterCard
International and Visa U.S.A., Inc. challenging certain aspects
of the payment card industry under U.S. federal antitrust law.
Those suits were later consolidated in the U.S. District Court
for the Eastern District of New York. The plaintiffs challenge
MasterCard’s “Honor All Cards” rule (and a
similar Visa rule), which ensures universal acceptance for
consumers by requiring merchants who accept MasterCard cards to
accept for payment every validly presented MasterCard card.
Plaintiffs claim that MasterCard and Visa unlawfully have tied
acceptance of debit cards to acceptance of credit cards. In
essence, the merchants desire the ability to reject off-line,
signature-based debit transactions (for example, MasterCard card
transactions) in favor of other payment forms, including
on-line, PIN-based debit transactions (for example, Maestro or
regional ATM network transactions) which generally impose lower
transaction costs for merchants. The plaintiffs also claim that
MasterCard and Visa have conspired to monopolize what they
characterize as the point-of-sale debit card market, thereby
suppressing the growth of regional networks such as ATM payment
systems. Plaintiffs allege that the plaintiff class has been
forced to pay unlawfully high prices for debit and credit card
transactions as a result of the alleged tying arrangement and
monopolization practices. There are related consumer class
actions pending in two state courts that have been stayed
pending developments in this matter.

MasterCard denies the merchant allegations and
believes that the “Honor All Cards” rule and
MasterCard practices with respect to debit card programs in the
United States are pro-competitive and fully consistent with U.S.
federal antitrust law.

On February 22, 2000, the district court
granted the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.
MasterCard and Visa subsequently appealed the decision to the
Second Circuit Court of Appeals. On October 17, 2001, a
three-judge panel affirmed the lower court decision by a
two-to-one majority. MasterCard filed a petition for a writ of
certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court on April 3, 2002,
which was denied on June 6, 2002.

Motions seeking summary judgment have been filed
by both sides and fully briefed in the district court. Arguments
for summary judgment motions were held on January 10, 2003.
The district court judge reserved decision on the motions. A
trial date of April 28, 2003 has been set.

Based upon publicly available information, the
plaintiffs previously have asserted damage claims in this
litigation of approximately $8 billion, before any trebling
under U.S. federal antitrust law. Other public estimates
(including estimates set forth in the dissenting opinion of the
Second Circuit) place the plaintiffs’ estimated damage
claims at approximately $50 billion to $100 billion,
depending on the source. In addition, the plaintiffs’
damage claims could be materially higher than these amounts as a
result of the passage of time and substantive changes in the
theory of damages presented by the plaintiffs. These figures
reflect claims asserted and should not be construed as an
acknowledgement of the reliability of the figures presented.
MasterCard believes that it is not currently possible to
estimate the impact, if any, that the ultimate resolution of
this matter will have on MasterCard’s results of
operations, financial position or cash flows. In accordance with
its policy pertaining to legal fees described in Note 2, the
Company accrued legal costs for its probable estimated legal
fees in connection with its participation in these proceedings.

Several lawsuits have been commenced by merchants
who have opted not to participate in the class action
litigation. Thus far, separate lawsuits have been commenced by
Meijer Stores, Toys “R” Us, Giant Eagle and Home
Depot. MasterCard is seeking to have all of these cases
transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of New York.

Currency Conversion Litigations

MasterCard International, together with Visa
U.S.A., Inc. and Visa International Corp., are defendants in a
state court lawsuit pending in California. The lawsuit alleges
that MasterCard and Visa wrongfully imposed an asserted one
percent currency conversion “fee” on every credit card
transaction by U.S. MasterCard and Visa cardholders involving
the purchase of goods or services in a foreign country, and that
such alleged “fee” is unlawful. This action, titled
Schwartz v. Visa Int’l Corp., et al., was brought in the
Superior Court of California in February 2000, purportedly on
behalf of the general public. Trial of the Schwartz matter
commenced on May 20, 2002 and concluded on
November 27, 2002. The Schwartz action claims that the
alleged “fee” grossly exceeds any costs the defendants
might incur in connection with currency conversions relating to
credit card purchase transactions made in foreign countries and
is not properly disclosed to cardholders. Plaintiffs seek to
prevent defendants from continuing to engage in, use or employ
the alleged practice of charging and collecting the asserted one
percent currency conversion “fee” and from charging
any type of purported currency conversion “fee”
without providing a clear, obvious and comprehensive notice that
a fee will be charged. Plaintiffs also request an order
(1) requiring defendants to fund a corrective advertising
campaign; and (2) awarding restitution of the monies
allegedly wrongfully acquired by imposing the purported currency
conversion “fee”. The complaints assert that, during
the four-year period that preceded the respective lawsuits,
MasterCard collected approximately $200 million as a result
of allegedly imposing the claimed one percent currency
conversion “fee”. MasterCard denies these allegations.

On February 5, 2003, the trial court judge
issued a preliminary decision in the Schwartz matter, which is
under seal. In his decision, the trial judge found that
MasterCard’s currency conversion process does not violate
the Truth In Lending Act or regulations, nor is it
unconscionably priced under California law. However, the judge
found that the practice is deceptive under California state law,
and ordered that MasterCard mandate that members disclose the
currency conversion process to cardholders in cardholder
agreements, applications, solicitations and monthly billing
statements. The judge also ordered unspecified restitution to
California cardholders. The parties filed objections to the
preliminary decision on February 27, 2003. A hearing on the
objections was held on March 4, 2003. If the decision is
not modified prior to becoming final, MasterCard presently
intends to appeal the decision.

MasterCard International, Visa U.S.A., Inc., Visa
International Corp., several member banks including Citibank
(South Dakota), N.A., Citibank (Nevada), N.A., Chase Manhattan
Bank USA, N.A., Bank of America, N.A. (USA), MBNA, and Diners
Club are defendants in a number of federal putative class
actions that allege, among other things, violations of federal
antitrust laws based on the asserted one percent currency
conversion “fee”.

Pursuant to an order of the Judicial Panel on
Multidistrict Litigation, the federal complaints have been
consolidated in MDL No. 1409 before Judge William H. Pauley
III in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
York. In January 2002, the federal plaintiffs filed a
Consolidated Amended Complaint (“MDL Complaint”)
adding MBNA Corporation and MBNA America Bank, N.A. as
defendants. This pleading asserts two theories of antitrust
conspiracy under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.
§1: (i) an alleged “inter-association”
conspiracy among MasterCard (together with its members), Visa
(together with its members) and Diners Club to fix currency
conversion “fees” allegedly charged to cardholders of
“no less than 1% of the transaction amount and frequently
more;” and (ii) two alleged
“intra-association” conspiracies, whereby each of Visa
and MasterCard is claimed separately to have conspired with its
members to fix currency conversion “fees” allegedly
charged to cardholders of “no less than 1% of the
transaction amount” and “to facilitate and encourage
institution — and collection — of second tier currency
conversion surcharges.” The MDL Complaint also asserts that
the alleged currency conversion “fees” have not been
disclosed as required by the Truth In Lending Act and
Regulation Z.

Defendants have moved to dismiss the MDL
Complaint. Oral argument on that motion was held on
June 21, 2002 and Judge Pauley reserved decision. Pending
determination of defendants’ motion to dismiss, the parties
may engage in discovery except for non-custodial depositions. No
trial date has been set.

MasterCard believes that it is not currently
possible to estimate the impact, if any, that the ultimate
resolution of these matters will have on its results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.

Global Interchange Proceedings

Interchange fees represent a sharing of payment
system costs among the financial institutions participating in a
four-party payment card system such as MasterCard’s.
Generally, interchange fees are paid by the merchant bank (the
“acquirer”) to the cardholder bank (the
“issuer”) in connection with transactions initiated
with the payment system’s cards. These fees reimburse the
issuer for a portion of the costs incurred by it in providing
services which are of benefit to all participants in the system,
including acquirers and merchants. MasterCard establishes a
multilateral interchange fee (“MIF”) in certain
circumstances as a default fee that applies when there is no
other interchange fee arrangement between the issuer and the
acquirer. MasterCard establishes a variety of MIF rates
depending on such considerations as the location and the type of
transaction, and collects the MIF on behalf of the institutions
entitled to receive it, but does not itself receive the MIF. As
described more fully below, MIFs are subject to regulatory or
legal review and/or challenges in a number of jurisdictions.
MasterCard believes that it is not currently possible to
estimate the impact, if any, that the ultimate resolution of
these matters will have on its results of operations, financial
position or cash flows.

European Union.

In
September 2000, the European Commission issued a “Statement
of Objections” challenging Visa International’s
cross-border MIF under European Community competition rules. On
July 24, 2002, the European Commission announced its
decision to exempt the Visa MIF from these rules based on
certain changes proposed by Visa to its MIF. Among other things,
in connection with the exemption order, Visa agreed to adopt a
cost-based methodology for calculating its MIF similar to the
methodology employed by MasterCard, which considers the costs of
certain specified services provided by issuers, and to reduce
its MIF rates for debit and credit transactions to amounts at or
below certain specified levels.



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share
data)

Although MasterCard Europe is not an addressee of
the Statement of Objections, its rules also contain a
cross-border MIF. MasterCard Europe intends to engage in
discussions with the European Commission in order to determine
under what conditions the European Commission would grant a
formal exemption or comfort letter for MasterCard Europe’s
MIF. Because the cross-border MIF constitutes an essential
element of MasterCard Europe’s operations, changes to it
could significantly impact MasterCard International’s
European members and the MasterCard business in Europe. At this
time, it is not possible to determine what action the European
Commission will take with respect to MasterCard Europe’s
MIF.

United Kingdom Office of Fair Trading.

On September 25, 2001, the Office
of Fair Trading of the United Kingdom (“OFT”) issued a
Statement of Objections (“SOO”) under the
U.K. Competition Act 1998 challenging the MasterCard MIF,
the fee paid by the acquiring bank to the issuing bank in
connection with point of sale transactions and multilateral
service fee (“MSF”), the fee paid by issuing banks to
acquiring banks when a customer uses a MasterCard-branded card
in the United Kingdom either at an ATM or over the counter to
obtain a cash advance, established by MasterCard U.K.
Members Forum Limited (formerly MEPUK) for domestic credit card
transactions in the United Kingdom. The SOO contained
preliminary conclusions to the effect that the MasterCard U.K.
MIF and MSF may infringe U.K. competition law and do not qualify
for an exemption in their present forms. In January, 2002,
MasterCard, MEPUK and several MasterCard U.K. members responded
to the SOO, and an oral hearing concerning the matter was held
on February 5, 2002. On February 11, 2003, the OFT
issued an amended SOO, which also contains preliminary
conclusions that challenge MasterCard’s U.K. MIF under the
Competition Act.

Because the MIF and MSF constitute essential
elements of MasterCard’s U.K. operations, changes to these
fees could significantly impact MasterCard’s U.K. members
and the MasterCard business in the U.K. At this time, it is not
possible to determine what action the OFT will take with respect
to the MasterCard MIF and MSF.

Australia.

On
August 27, 2002, the Reserve Bank of Australia
(“RBA”) announced regulations under the Payments
Systems (Regulation) Act 1998 (the “Act”) applicable
to four-party credit card payment systems in Australia,
including MasterCard’s. The RBA regulations would impose a
number of changes on the operation of four-party credit card
systems that could significantly impact MasterCard
International’s Australian members and the MasterCard
business in Australia. Among other things, the RBA regulations
permit non-deposit-taking institutions to issue credit cards and
acquire credit card transactions in Australia, mandate a formula
for calculating interchange fees that fails to account for
certain costs incurred by issuers (such as credit losses) and
effectively requires a reduction in domestic interchange fees,
and prohibit MasterCard and other four-party credit card systems
from enforcing their respective “no surcharge” and
“net issuer” rules. The no surcharge rule generally
prevents merchants from charging supplemental fees for the use
of payment cards at the point of sale, and the net issuer rule
requires institutions participating in the relevant system to
issue payment cards in addition to conducting merchant acquiring
activities.

On September 20, 2002, MasterCard filed an
application with the Federal Court of Australia seeking to
overturn the RBA regulations. MasterCard believes that in
implementing the regulations the RBA has failed to comply with
the obligations imposed upon it by the Act. Among other things,
MasterCard believes that the RBA regulations fail to satisfy the
public interest test mandated by the Act because they can be
expected to impose additional costs on Australian consumers,
place small businesses at a competitive disadvantage to larger
retailers, and encourage small or regional banks to exit the
credit card business in Australia. Visa International Corp.
filed a similar application with the Federal Court of Australia
on September 19, 2002. A hearing on the matter is scheduled
to begin on May 19, 2003. At this time, it is not possible
to determine the outcome of MasterCard’s legal challenge to
the RBA regulations.

United States.

In
July 2002, a putative class action lawsuit was filed by a group
of merchants in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of California against MasterCard International, Visa



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

U.S.A., Inc., Visa International Corp. and
several member banks in California, alleging, among other
things, that MasterCard’s and Visa’s interchange fees
contravene the Sherman Act. The suit seeks treble damages in an
unspecified amount, attorney’s fees and injunctive relief,
including the divestiture of bank ownership of MasterCard and
Visa, and the elimination of MasterCard and Visa marketing
activities. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint
on September 10, 2002. The motion has been fully briefed.
The case was recently reassigned to a new judge in federal
district court in San Francisco. Neither an oral argument date
on the motion nor a trial date has been set in this matter.

Other Jurisdictions.

MasterCard is aware that regulatory
authorities in certain other jurisdictions, including Japan,
Poland and Hong Kong, are reviewing MasterCard’s and/or its
members interchange fee practices and may seek to regulate the
establishment of such fees.

Note 15.     Settlement
and Travelers Cheque Risk Management

The Company has global risk management policies
and procedures, which include risk standards to provide a
framework for managing the Company’s settlement exposure.
Generally, settlement risk is the legal exposure due to the
difference in timing between the payment transaction date and
subsequent settlement. MasterCard International’s rules
generally guarantee the payment of MasterCard transactions and
certain Cirrus and Maestro transactions between principal
members. The term and amount of the guarantee are unlimited. In
the event that MasterCard International effects a payment on
behalf of a failed member, MasterCard International takes
assignment of the underlying receivables. Subject to approval by
the Board of Directors and certain limitations provided in the
Company’s bylaws, members may be assessed for the amount of
any settlement loss.

Settlement risk is estimated using the average
daily card charges during the quarter multiplied by the
estimated number of days to settle. Member-reported transaction
data and the transaction clearing data underlying these
estimations may be revised in subsequent reporting periods.
MasterCard’s estimated settlement exposure utilizing the
aforementioned methodology for the quarters ended
December 31, 2002, September 30, 2002 and
December 31, 2001, after consideration of the collateral
amounts set forth below, amounted to $9,793,848, $9,145,505 and
$8,330,609, respectively. A portion of the Company’s
uncollateralized estimated settlement exposure for
MasterCard-branded transactions (estimated at $1,053,091,
$954,372 and $569,247 for the quarters ended December 31,
2002, September 30, 2002 and December 31, 2001,
respectively) relates to members that are deemed not to be in
compliance with, or that are under review in connection with,
the Company’s risk management standards. The increase in
uncollateralized exposure for non-compliant members was based on
volume increases and certain members falling out of compliance
with MasterCard’s member risk standards in 2002 primarily
caused by rating downgrades and regulatory scrutiny. From time
to time, the Company reviews its risk management methodology and
standards. As such, the amounts of uncollateralized estimated
settlement exposure relating to non-compliant members are
revised as necessary. In the event of uncollateralized member
risk losses, the Company also considers the appropriateness of
establishing reserves for non-payment. MasterCard International
has established a reserve of $1,254 which is an estimate of
probable future losses.

To minimize its exposure to settlement risk,
MasterCard International members that are not in compliance with
the Company’s risk standards in effect at the time may be
required, after management review of the individual risk
circumstances, to provide collateral, typically in the form of
letters of credit, bank guarantees, cash deposits or escrow
accounts. MasterCard held collateral for estimated legal
settlement risk of MasterCard-branded transactions in the amount
of $1,394,644, $1,307,329 and $1,267,017 at December 31,
2002, September 30, 2002 and December 31, 2001,
respectively. In addition to these amounts, MasterCard held
collateral to cover: variability and future growth in member
programs; the possibility that it may choose to pay merchants to
protect brand integrity in the event of acquirer settlement
failure as described below; and



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share
data)

Cirrus and Maestro related risk as described
below. MasterCard monitors its credit risk portfolio on a
regular basis to estimate potential concentration risks and the
adequacy of collateral on hand.

MasterCard’s estimated settlement exposure
under the MasterCard brand, net of collateral, had
concentrations of 62%, 63% and 65% in North America and 21%, 22%
and 18% in Europe for the quarters ended December 31, 2002,
September 30, 2002 and December 31, 2001,
respectively. In addition to the settlement risk identified
above, the Company provides settlement guarantees with respect
to certain Cirrus and Maestro transactions that the Company
processes. The Company’s estimated Cirrus and Maestro
settlement exposures, utilizing the aforementioned methodology,
were $467,560, $630,247 and $434,103 for the quarters ended
December 31, 2002, September 30, 2002 and December 31,
2001, respectively. The Company holds collateral for a portion
of these exposures. In addition, the Company guarantees certain
Cirrus- and Maestro-branded transactions in Europe and certain
Maestro-branded transactions in Latin America that are processed
outside of the Cirrus and Maestro settlement systems. The
Company is currently not able to quantify these exposures.
Collateral is also held for a portion of these exposures.

In order to maintain the integrity and acceptance
of the Company’s brands, although it is not contractually
obligated to do so, the Company may also elect to pay merchants
for transactions in the event that a principal acquiring member
of MasterCard International defaults on its obligations to the
merchants. MasterCard holds collateral to cover this risk from
certain acquirers depending on their individual risk
circumstances.

MasterCard has also guaranteed the payment of
MasterCard-branded travelers cheques outstanding to ensure
payment if issuers default. The term and amount of the guarantee
are unlimited. MasterCard had outstanding MasterCard-branded
travelers cheques of $1,377,933 and $1,591,940 at
December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively.
MasterCard holds approximately $2,325 in cash in order to meet
travelers cheques obligations of certain issuers who have
discontinued their MasterCard travelers cheques programs. A
significant portion of the Company’s credit risk is
concentrated in one MasterCard travelers cheque issuer.
MasterCard has obtained an unlimited guarantee estimated at
$1,153,233 and $1,368,526 at December 31, 2002 and
December 31, 2001, respectively, from a financial
institution in order to cover all of the exposure of outstanding
travelers cheques with respect to that issuer. In addition,
MasterCard has obtained guarantees estimated at $35,731 and
$36,689 at December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001,
respectively, from financial institutions in order to cover the
exposure of outstanding travelers cheques with respect to
another issuer.

Note 16.     Foreign
Exchange Risk Management

The Company enters into foreign exchange
contracts to minimize the risk associated with anticipated
revenues and expenses, and assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies. MasterCard’s forward contracts are
listed below separated by functional currency.

U.S. Dollar Functional
Currency



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share
data)

Euro Functional Currency

The currencies underlying the foreign currency
forward contracts consist primarily of euro, U.K. pounds
sterling, Swiss francs, Japanese yen, and Canadian dollar. The
fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts generally
reflects the estimated amounts that the Company would receive or
(pay to) terminate the contracts at the reporting date based on
broker quotes for the same or similar instruments. The terms of
the foreign currency forward contracts are generally less than
18 months and the Company has deferred $2,498 of net losses
in other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2002, all
of which is expected to be reclassified to earnings within the
next twelve months to provide an economic offset to the earnings
impact of the anticipated cash flows hedged.

The Company’s derivative financial
instruments are subject to both credit and market risk. Credit
risk is the risk of loss due to failure of a counterparty to
perform its obligations in accordance with contractual terms.
Market risk is the potential change in an investment’s
value caused by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange
rates, credit spreads or other variables. Credit and market risk
related to derivative instruments were not material at
December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001.

Generally, the Company does not obtain collateral
related to forward contracts because of the high credit ratings
of the counter-parties involved. The amount of accounting loss
the Company would incur if the counterparties failed to perform
according to the terms of the contracts is not considered
material.

Note 17.

Segment Reporting

In accordance with SFAS No. 131,
“Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information,” MasterCard has one reportable segment,
“Payment Services.” All of the Company’s
activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent upon
and supportive of the other. Accordingly, all significant
operating decisions are based upon analyses of MasterCard as one
operating segment. The CEO has been identified as the chief
operating decision-maker.

There is no single customer that accounted for
more than 10 percent of the Company’s revenue. Revenue
generated in the United States of America accounted for
approximately 61%, 65% and 66% of the Company’s total
revenue for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively. The Company estimates that no other
individual country contributed a significant portion to the
Company’s revenue for each of the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000.

MasterCard does not maintain or measure
long-lived assets by geographic location.

Note 18.

Subsequent Event

MasterCard purchased a building on
January 7, 2003 in Kansas City, Missouri for approximately
$24,000. This building will be a backup data center which will
replace the existing backup data center in Lake Success, New
York.

Directors
and Executive Officers of the Registrant

The board of directors of MasterCard Incorporated
is comprised of 18 voting directors and two non-voting
directors. Presently there are two vacancies on the board of
directors. The certificate of incorporation of MasterCard
International requires MasterCard Incorporated, as the sole
class B member of MasterCard International, to elect the
directors of MasterCard Incorporated to serve as the directors
of MasterCard International.

The board of directors of MasterCard Incorporated
is subject to election for a one-year term at the annual meeting
of stockholders of MasterCard Incorporated presently scheduled
to be held on April 23, 2003. Subject to the requirements
set forth in the bylaws of MasterCard Incorporated, the
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the MasterCard
Incorporated board of directors is charged with nominating
individuals to stand for election as directors at annual
meetings of stockholders. The Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee is expected to meet on March 19, 2003
to make such nominations for the 2003 annual meeting of
stockholders. At this meeting, the Committee is expected to
nominate substantially all of the existing slate of directors
described below to stand for election at the 2003 annual meeting
of stockholders, together with such number of director-nominees
as is required to allow for the election of 18 voting directors
and two non-voting directors at the annual meeting of
stockholders.

The bylaws of MasterCard Incorporated require
that directors be officers of a member institution of MasterCard
International or an individual otherwise uniquely qualified to
provide guidance on MasterCard’s affairs. During the
three-year transition period following the closing of the
Integration, which includes 2003, one third of the total number
of directors will be representatives of European
member-stockholders, one third of the total number of directors
will be representatives of U.S. member-stockholders, the
President and Chief Executive Officer will be a director, and
the remaining directors will be apportioned among the other
regions of MasterCard International in accordance with the
percentage of common stock of MasterCard Incorporated owned by
the stockholders of those regions.

A number of the largest members of MasterCard
International that generate significant business for MasterCard
have representatives on the MasterCard Incorporated board of
directors. If any of these members were to lose its
representation on the board, this could have a detrimental
effect on our business relationship with that member. One
member-stockholder of MasterCard Incorporated holding more than
5% of MasterCard Incorporated common stock is entitled to cancel
its business agreement with MasterCard International if one of
its employees does not have a board seat.

The following table sets forth certain
information regarding the current directors and executive
officers of MasterCard Incorporated and MasterCard International.

The following table lists grants of performance
units in 2002 to the Named Executive Officers:

(1)

The performance units were granted under the
    Company’s Executive Incentive Plan. Each performance unit
    has a target value equal to $100. The actual value of each Unit
    will be calculated based on the Company’s performance over
    a three-year period based on a combination of qualitative and
    quantitative measures that include: improving profitable share
    with key members in key markets; improving customer focused
    strategy; achieving corporate financial targets and enhancing
    organizational capabilities. Each Unit will be valued at target
    ($100) if, on a weighted-average basis, target performance is
    achieved for all of the performance measures. Each unit will be
    valued at threshold ($50) if, on a weighted-average basis,
    threshold performance is achieved. Each Unit will be valued at
    maximum ($200) if, on a weighted-average basis, maximum
    performance is achieved. For performance between threshold and
    target or target and maximum, the value of the Units will be
    increased on a straight line basis. The Units will have no value
    if performance is below threshold.

The performance units described in the preceding
table vest in annual increments according to the following
schedule if the participant completes 1,000 hours of service and
is employed by the Company on the last day of the respective
twelve-month cycle:

Upon completion of the three-year performance
period, participants will receive a payout equal to 80% of the
award earned. The remaining 20% of the award will be paid upon
completion of two additional years of service, (i.e.,
five years of service in total). Special provisions apply
upon certain terminations of employment.

year in accordance with the table below:

based on the following allocation options:

The annual investment credits on the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Account were restricted to a minimum of 0%
and a maximum of 15%. No election can be made for plan years
beginning after December 31, 2002. When a participant

participant’s account is paid in a lump sum or converted
into an annuity.

Supplemental
Retirement Benefits

Supplemental retirement benefits are provided to
all Named Executive Officers and certain other participants
under various funded and unfunded nonqualified plans. Benefits
are provided to certain employees whose benefits are limited by

benefits (“SERP”).

after-tax savings plan designed to provide employees with
benefits and contributions to the extent amounts under
MasterCard’s qualified plans are capped by IRS limitations.
Each year, MasterCard pays participants a bonus distributed in
the form of a premium payment to a tax-deferred annuity
contract. Annual contributions and reimbursement for tax
obligations in connection with the plan are reported and
separately reflected in the Summary Compensation Table for each
of the Named Executive Officers.

MasterCard Savings Plan (401(k) Plan) and
    Profit-Sharing Plan

Most Company employees are eligible to
participate in the 401(k) plan. Employees who participate in the
plan may contribute from 2% to 6% of base pay on a tax-deferred
basis or after-tax basis. Employees may also contribute
supplemental tax-deferred and after-tax amounts from 1% to 5%.
Internal Revenue Service limits apply to all tax-deferred
contributions.

A match of 217% (changing effective
January 1, 2003 to 100%) is provided on employee
contributions up to 6% of base pay. Employees must contribute to
the 401(k) plan to receive matching contributions. Matching
contributions are 100% vested after 4 years of service
under a graded vesting schedule. Loans and certain types of
withdrawals are permitted.

In addition, effective January 1, 2003, the
