Item 1.

Business

Overview

MasterCard Incorporated is a leading global payment solutions
company that provides a variety of services principally in
support of our customers’ credit, deposit access (debit),
electronic cash and related payment programs. We manage a family
of well-known, widely accepted payment card brands including
MasterCard®, MasterCard
Electronic

tm

,
Maestro® and Cirrus®, which we license to our
customers. As part of managing these brands, we also provide our
customers with a sophisticated set of information and
transaction processing services and establish and enforce rules
and standards surrounding the use of our payment card network by
customers and merchants. We generate revenues from the fees that
we charge our customers for providing such transaction
processing and other payment services (operation fees), and by
assessing our members for the gross dollar volume
(“GDV”) of activity on cards carrying our brands
(assessments).

Using our transaction processing services, our customers
facilitate payment transactions between cardholders and
merchants throughout the world, providing merchants with an
efficient and secure payment option, and consumers and
businesses with a convenient payment vehicle accepted worldwide.
We guarantee the settlement of many of these transactions to
ensure the integrity of our payment network. In addition, we
undertake a variety of marketing activities designed to maintain
and enhance the value of our brands. We work with our customers
and other industry partners to develop innovative new
technologies and applications for our payment programs,
including in the areas of electronic and mobile commerce and
chip-based cards.

MasterCard Incorporated was incorporated as a Delaware stock
corporation in May 2001. We conduct our business principally
through MasterCard Incorporated’s principal operating
subsidiary, MasterCard International Incorporated
(“MasterCard International”), a Delaware membership
corporation that was formed in November 1966. Through MasterCard
International, our business is structured as an open bankcard
association, in which cardholder and merchant relationships are
managed principally by our customers. Accordingly, we do not
issue cards, set cardholder fees or determine the interest rates
(if applicable) or fees charged to cardholders using cards that
carry our brands. Our customers are the principal and affiliate
members of MasterCard International, which we refer to
collectively as our “customers” or
“members.” We refer to the customers that issue our
cards as “issuers” and those that enroll merchants
into programs to accept our cards as “acquirers.” We
use the term “card” to refer to the plastic cards
carrying our brands or those of our competitors, together with
the underlying credit, charge, deposit or asset account. We use
the term “MasterCard” to refer to the MasterCard brand
generally, and to the business conducted by MasterCard
Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including
MasterCard International and MasterCard Europe sprl
(“MasterCard Europe”). The common stock of MasterCard
Incorporated is owned by principal members of MasterCard
International.

In 2004, our GDV as reported by our customers was $1.455
trillion, a 10.6% increase (on a local currency basis) over the
GDV generated in 2003. On a regional basis, 2004 GDV growth was
9.3% in the United States, 12.8% in Canada, 14.2% in Europe,
33.3% in Latin America, 25.5% in South Asia/ Middle East/ Africa
(“SAMEA”) and 1.8% in Asia/ Pacific. GDV has increased
93.2% (on a local currency basis) since 1999. GDV represents
gross usage (purchase and cash transactions) on
MasterCard-branded cards for goods and services, including
balance transfers and convenience checks. These figures exclude
Maestro and Cirrus transactions. At December 31, 2004, the
total number of MasterCard cards in circulation worldwide as
reported by our customers was 679.5 million, an 8.6%
increase from December 31, 2003.

In recent years, our corporate strategy has been to focus on our
key customers to drive our business growth; to strengthen our
brands, technology and acceptance network; and to differentiate
MasterCard from our competition by developing innovative payment
solutions and customized consulting services. We remain
committed to this strategic direction and have begun to
implement initiatives to expand our customer-focused approach to
a broader group of customers, as well as to further develop
relationships with merchants that accept our cards. We will also
seek to leverage our expertise in payment programs, consulting
services, brand marketing, technology and processing to expand
the value-added services we provide our customers. We believe
that debit and prepaid programs as well as corporate payment
solutions offer particularly attractive opportunities for
further growth.



We believe there are significant opportunities for continued
strong growth in our core business, particularly in
international markets. These opportunities take two forms.
First, we continue to benefit from a worldwide trend in which
payments are migrating from paper-based forms (such as cash and
checks) to electronic forms (such as payment cards). This trend
has helped to drive our volume and revenue growth for a number
of years, and we expect it to continue in 2005. Second, we
believe there is an opportunity to increase MasterCard’s
share of our customers’ overall spending on their payments
businesses, by such means as pursuing additional transaction
processing opportunities and by continuing to enter into
business agreements with key customers. These business
agreements allow us to support the individual needs of our
customers with tailored pricing and other business arrangements
in exchange for significant volume and other commitments to
MasterCard. In particular, we believe that there are significant
opportunities to pursue transaction processing arrangements and
additional business agreements outside the United States.

We operate in a dynamic and rapidly evolving regulatory
environment, particularly with respect to interchange fees.
Interchange fees represent a sharing of payment system costs
among the financial institutions participating in a four-party
payment card system such as ours. Generally, interchange fees
are paid by acquirers to issuers in connection with transactions
initiated with our cards. These fees are collected from
acquirers and passed to issuers to reimburse the issuers for a
portion of the costs incurred by them in providing services
which are of benefit to all participants in the system,
including acquirers and merchants. We establish multilateral
interchange fees (“MIFs”) in certain circumstances as
default fees that apply when there are no other interchange fee
arrangements in place between an issuer and an acquirer. We
administer the collection of MIFs through the settlement
process; however, we generally do not earn revenues from them.
MIFs are a significant component of the costs that merchants pay
to accept payment cards and are subject to regulatory or legal
challenges in a number of jurisdictions. We are devoting
substantial management and financial resources to the defense of
MIFs and to the other legal and regulatory challenges we face,
as described more fully below in “Risk Factors”.

As a global business, we have structured our organization to be
sensitive to the requirements of the regions and countries in
which we operate. Our global board of directors has delegated
authority over a variety of matters, including certain
rulemaking, enforcement and fee-setting decisions, to regional
boards of directors covering each of Asia/ Pacific, Canada,
Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, SAMEA, and the United
States.



Payment Services

Transaction Processing

We operate a network that links issuers and acquirers around the
globe for transaction processing services and, through them,
permits MasterCard cardholders to use their cards at millions of
merchants worldwide. A typical transaction processed over our
network involves four participants in addition to ourselves:
issuers, acquirers, merchants and cardholders. Consequently, the
payment system we operate is often referred to as a
“four-party” payment system. In a typical transaction,
a cardholder purchases goods or services from a merchant using a
card. After the transaction is authorized by the issuer using
our network, the acquirer pays the amount of the purchase, net
of a discount, to the merchant. This discount, which we refer to
as the merchant discount, takes into consideration the amount of
the interchange fee. The issuer pays the acquirer an amount
equal to the value of the transaction minus any interchange fee
and posts the transaction to the cardholder’s account. We
provide transaction processing services to facilitate the
authorization, clearing and settlement of these transactions and
similar transactions through our proprietary, worldwide computer
and telecommunications network. A significant portion of our
revenues — approximately 35% in 2004 — are
earned in connection with our provision of these authorization,
clearing and settlement services. Our transaction processing
services are provided principally through our Global Technology
and Operations headquarters in O’Fallon, Missouri.

Authorization, Clearing and Settlement.

Authorization
refers to the process by which a transaction is approved by the
issuer or, in certain circumstances, by MasterCard or others on
behalf of the issuer in accordance with the issuer’s
instructions. MasterCard’s network provides for the
transmission of authorization requests and results among
issuers, acquirers and other transaction processors or networks.
Our rules, which may vary across regions, establish the
circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek
authorization of transactions. We processed over
9.2 billion MasterCard-branded authorizations on our global
processing systems in 2004.

Clearing refers to the exchange of financial transaction
information between the issuer and the acquirer after a
transaction has been completed. MasterCard transactions are
generally cleared through our centralized processing system,
known as the Global Clearing Management System (GCMS), and the
related information is typically routed among customers via our
data transport network, which we refer to as Banknet.

Once transactions have been authorized and cleared, MasterCard
provides services in connection with the settlement of the
transaction — that is, the exchange of funds along
with associated fees. Settlement is provided through our
Settlement Account Management (SAM) system. Once clearing is
completed, a daily



reconciliation is provided to each customer involved in
settlement, detailing the net amounts by clearing cycle and a
final settlement position. The actual exchange of funds takes
place between a clearing bank chosen by the customer and
approved by MasterCard, and a settlement bank chosen by
MasterCard. Customer settlement occurs in U.S. dollars or
in other selected currencies, in accordance with established
rules.

We also operate the MasterCard Debit Switch (“MDS”),
which principally supports the processing of Cirrus and Maestro
debit transactions. The MDS switches financial messages,
provides transaction and statistical reporting, and performs
clearing and settlement between customers and other debit
transaction processing networks. Unlike the authorization and
clearing processes described above, which involve the exchange
of transaction data in two discrete messages (one for
authorization and again for clearing); the MDS generally
operates as a “single message” system in which
clearing occurs simultaneously with the initial authorization
request.

Our transaction processing services are available 24 hours
per day, every day of the year. In the event that our main
processing facility in O’Fallon, Missouri, becomes
disabled, we have a co-processing facility in Kansas City,
Missouri. Our transaction processing systems have redundant
power supplies and back-up processes to ensure continued
operation in the event of a fault. We consistently maintain core
systems availability for our global processing systems at a rate
in excess of 99.9%.

We also generate a significant amount of revenue from processing
foreign currency transactions for our customers. On a global
scale, we have the ability to process transactions denominated
in more than 160 currencies. These revenues are the result of
cross-border transactions by cardholders that require currency
conversion to settle the transactions between issuers and
acquirers. MasterCard generally uses a wholesale rate increased
by a certain percentage or a government-mandated rate to convert
transactions in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.
Revenues from processing currency conversion transactions
fluctuate with cross-border travel, which is impacted by changes
in foreign currency exchange rates.

In addition to revenues associated with transaction processing,
we earn a significant portion of our revenues —
approximately 37% in 2004 — from assessments on our
customers calculated on the GDV on cards carrying our brands.

Regional Transaction Processing.

We provide transaction
processing (authorization, clearing and settlement) services for
customers in the Europe region through our subsidiary MasterCard
Europe. These services, which allow European customers to
facilitate payment transactions between cardholders and
merchants throughout Europe, are provided via our European
Payment Systems Network (“EPS-Net”) for authorization
services and European Common Clearing and Settlement System
(“ECCSS”) for clearing and settlement services. We are
presently in the midst of a multi-year technical convergence
project to fully integrate ECCSS with our global clearing and
settlement systems. We also operate a separate regional
processing facility for the Asia/ Pacific region in Australia.

Outside of the United States and a select number of other
jurisdictions, most intra-country (as opposed to cross-border)
transaction activity conducted with MasterCard, Maestro and
Cirrus cards is authorized, cleared and/or settled by our
customers or other processors without the involvement of
MasterCard’s central processing systems. We do not earn
transaction processing fees for such activity. Accordingly, a
significant portion of our non-U.S. revenues are derived
from processing cross-border transactions, and therefore our
business is dependent on trends in cross-border travel. For
example, the recovery of cross-border travel in 2004 from the
depressed levels in 2003 due to SARS and the war in Iraq was a
significant source of our 2004 revenue growth. As part of our
strategy, we are developing and promoting domestic processing
solutions for our customers that are designed to leverage our
significant investments in our global and regional processing
systems. During 2003, MasterCard Europe began authorizing and
clearing transactions for the members of S2 Limited,
formerly known as Switch Card Services Limited, which operate an
electronic domestic debit card network in the United Kingdom
under the Switch® brand, as part of an agreement to migrate
Switch branding to Maestro by 2007.



Customer Relationship Management

To facilitate our customer-focused strategy we have teams of
employees dedicated to managing our relationships with our key
customers. We believe the coordinated, high quality services
provided by these teams is a significant advantage for
MasterCard that distinguishes us from our competitors. We also
seek to enter into business agreements with key customers
through which we offer financial incentives and other financial
support to issue and promote our cards. These incentives often
consist of a reduction in our volume-based fees and assessments
for certain customers based on the achievement of GDV hurdles or
other performance metrics.

We believe that our business agreements with key customers have
contributed to our strong volume and revenue growth in recent
years and that these agreements will continue to drive our
business performance in 2005. However, as consolidation in the
banking industry produces a smaller number of larger customers,
which generally have a greater ability to negotiate pricing
discounts with MasterCard, we may have to increase the amount of
these incentives and other financial support in order to stay
competitive, which could adversely affect our revenues and
profitability.

In 2004, JP Morgan Chase Bank and its affiliates
contributed to over 10% of our consolidated revenues. Net fees
earned from JP Morgan Chase Bank and its affiliates were
approximately $315 million. Loss of a substantial amount of
revenues from JP Morgan Chase Bank and its affiliates could
have a material adverse effect on our business. See “Risk
Factors”.

MasterCard Payment Programs

MasterCard offers a wide range of payment solutions to enable
our customers to design, package and implement programs targeted
to the specific needs of their own customers. Our principal
payment programs, which are facilitated through our brands,
include consumer credit and debit programs, corporate payment
solutions and stored value programs. Our issuers determine the
competitive features for the cards issued under our programs,
including interest rates and fees.

Consumer Programs — Credit and Charge

MasterCard offers a number of consumer credit and charge
programs that are designed to meet the needs of our customers.
We are able to customize programs to address specific consumer
segments. Our consumer credit programs include Standard, Gold,
Platinum and World MasterCard cards. Standard MasterCard cards
are general purpose credit cards targeted to consumers with
basic needs for a credit card. Gold MasterCard cards are
targeted to consumers typically requiring a higher line of
credit or spending limit and one or more card enhancement
services associated with a card. Platinum MasterCard cards are
offered with still higher credit lines or spending limits and
also provides a full range of card enhancement services. World
MasterCard cards, which are aimed at affluent households in the
United States, have no preset spending limit and the option to
revolve a designated portion of the charges made. In
February 2005, MasterCard enhanced the World MasterCard
card program to offer consumers rewards points in categories of
their choosing, and to provide issuers with a uniquely
customizable array of incentives designed to complement their
consumers’ life-cycle changes and evolving preferences.
These cards are targeted principally for travel and
entertainment use and are accompanied with best-in-class
enhancement services and loyalty rewards programs.

MasterCard also offers a variety of innovative card programs in
selected markets throughout the world. For example, MasterCard
Electronic cards offer additional control and risk management
features by requiring 100% issuer authorization. The MasterCard
Electronic program is designed to curb fraud and control
exposure in high risk markets. The MasterCard Unembossed program
encourages merchants to submit transactions electronically.
MasterCard has also created innovative, alternate card forms to
help our customers differentiate their programs. For example,
MasterCard
mc(2)

tm

cards are generally chip-enabled and feature a distinctive
cutaway corner card design. MasterCard has launched MasterCard
mc(2) programs in the Europe, Latin America/Caribbean and
Asia/Pacific regions.



The services provided in connection with all MasterCard credit
cards and for which we charge issuers include lost/stolen card
reporting, emergency card replacement and emergency cash
advance. Optional services, such as emergency travel assistance,
are also available on many MasterCard cards. Required services
are generally provided through third-party service providers
arranged by MasterCard, including a licensed insurance company
retained by MasterCard to provide insurance services.

Consumer Programs — Deposit Access

MasterCard supports a range of payment solutions that allow our
customers to provide consumers with convenient access to funds
on deposit in checking, demand deposit and other accounts. Our
deposit access programs may be branded with the MasterCard,
Maestro and/or Cirrus marks, and can be used to obtain cash in
bank branches or at Automated Teller Machines
(“ATMs”). In addition, MasterCard- and Maestro-branded
debit cards may be used to make purchases at the point of sale.
Like our consumer credit programs, we support debit Gold
MasterCard programs and debit Platinum MasterCard programs that
issuers can offer as premium services to cardholders. Issuers
may also provide enhancement services and loyalty rewards
programs in connection with debit cards carrying our brands.

We refer to debit programs where the primary means of cardholder
validation at the point of sale is for cardholders to sign a
sales receipt and where transaction data is exchanged in two
discrete messages (one for authorization and again for clearing)
as “offline”. We refer to debit programs where
cardholders enter a personal identification number
(“PIN”) at a point of sale terminal for validation and
where transaction data is exchanged through a single message
with the initial authorization as “online”.

We offer MasterCard-branded offline debit card programs in the
United States and other countries. In 2004, Associated Bank,
Bank of the West and Washington Mutual, which collectively issue
an estimated 10 million offline debit cards, selected
MasterCard for their offline debit card programs. In addition,
MasterCard has entered into a debit processing alliance with
eFunds Corporation, a leading provider of electronic payments
software and processing solutions. Under the alliance, we market
eFunds’ processing services as an integrated component of
our debit programs. The alliance is intended to add a flexible,
end-to-end debit transaction processing solution to the package
of services and products already available to our customers.

As a result of the Settlement Agreement in the
U.S. merchant lawsuit described in Note 14 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements herein, MasterCard has taken a
number of actions to modify its MasterCard-branded offline debit
card programs in the United States. Among other things,
MasterCard has adopted rules that allow merchants to reject
MasterCard-branded debit cards issued in the United States,
while still accepting other MasterCard-branded cards, and vice
versa. However, U.S. merchants who choose to accept
MasterCard-branded debit cards must accept all
MasterCard-branded debit cards.

Maestro is MasterCard’s global online debit program.
Maestro cards are issued, and Maestro transactions are
processed, pursuant to a set of rules and procedures that are
separate from the rules applicable to MasterCard credit and
offline debit transactions. Based on information from our
customers and other sources, we estimate that, at
December 31, 2004, the Maestro brand mark appeared on
approximately 562.6 million cards worldwide and that
Maestro was accepted for purchases at more than 8.4 million
merchant locations.

The MasterCard ATM Network is among the world’s largest
global ATM networks, with more than 1 million participating
ATMs and other cash dispensing locations around the globe.
Generally, cardholders with cards bearing the MasterCard,
Maestro or Cirrus logo may use a network ATM to access funds on
deposit in their accounts (if a debit card is used) or to obtain
a cash advance (if a credit card is used).

We make the Cirrus brand available to customers to provide
global cash access through the MasterCard ATM Network for our
customers’ proprietary ATM cards. Cirrus transactions are
validated by entering a PIN. Cirrus cards are issued and
processed pursuant to a set of rules and procedures applicable
specifically to ATM transactions.



Corporate Payment Solutions

MasterCard offers corporate payment solutions that allow large
corporations, mid-sized companies, small businesses and public
sector organizations to streamline their payment processes,
manage information and reduce administrative costs.

The MasterCard Corporate Card® is designed to allow
organizations to manage employee travel and entertainment
expenses. MasterCard Corporate Executive Cards, marketed in such
countries as the United States, Canada, Chile and France, are
targeted at senior executives and offer increased spending
limits, concierge services and worldwide, 24-hour customer
service. MasterCard Corporate Purchasing Cards, marketed
globally, are designed to assist in the corporate purchasing
process and provide companies with access to enhanced line item
transaction detail. MasterCard Corporate Fleet Cards provide
companies with a way to monitor and control the expenses of a
commercial fleet at the vehicle or driver level, as well as to
capture and manage detailed spending data. Finally, the
MasterCard Corporate Multi Card® is an integrated card
program that combines the functionality of one or more of our
MasterCard corporate programs — travel, purchasing and
fleet — into a single card or account, thereby
reducing the costs of managing multiple card programs. We also
offer a variety of payment programs for public sector entities
that are similar to the travel, purchasing, fleet and Multi Card
programs offered to corporations. The MasterCard
BusinessCard® and Executive BusinessCard are targeted at
the small-business segment, offering business owners the ability
to gain access to working capital, extend payments and separate
business expenses from personal expenses.

MasterCard has also developed programs that offer unique
benefits to organizations ranging from small businesses to large
corporations by integrating payment transaction data into
financial systems. Such programs, which aim to facilitate
paperless end-to-end corporate purchasing for our customers,
include the MasterCard Multinational Corporate Program (global
consolidation of payment transactions), MasterCard
e-P3

tm

(accounts payable re-engineering), MasterCard
ExpenSys

tm

(expense reporting), MasterCard Smart Data (management
reporting) and MasterCard SmartLink (enterprise reporting
systems).

Stored Value Programs

Stored value programs involve a balance account that is funded
with monetary value prior to use. Funds in the account may be
accessed via a traditional magnetic stripe or chip-enabled
payment card (prepaid cards) or paper-based travelers cheques.

Prepaid.

MasterCard’s customers may implement
prepaid payment programs using any of the MasterCard family of
brands (MasterCard, MasterCard Electronic, Maestro or Cirrus).
MasterCard provides processing services, including
authorization, clearing and settlement, in support of either
magnetic stripe or chip-enabled prepaid card programs and can
maintain card account balance information.

Travelers Cheques.

Travelers cheques are a form of
payment for use at the point of sale or at bank branches.
MasterCard-branded travelers cheques are issued by a number of
customers around the world. For a description of our guarantee
obligations relating to travelers cheques, see Note 17 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements herein.

Consulting, Information and Related Services

Our MasterCard Advisors group provides our customers with a wide
range of tailored consulting services and information and other
products associated with their payments activities and programs.
In 2004, MasterCard Advisors expanded existing services in the
areas of research, customer relationship management, database
marketing and mining, information and risk management
consulting, and outsourcing. Such expansion included the
acquisitions of The Tower Group, Inc., a research and advisory
firm, in February 2004 and Watch Hill Partners, Inc., a
customer relationship management consultancy, in May 2004.
In addition, MasterCard Advisors introduced new services in the
area of database mining, including the launch of the
SpendingPulse™ national retail data service, which
aggregates and analyzes transaction processing data in the
United States to produce estimates of U.S. retail sales.
MasterCard Advisors charges our customers and



others fees for its professional services. At this time,
MasterCard Advisors does not make a significant contribution to
our revenues.

Global e-Business and Emerging Technologies

MasterCard is supporting innovation in the payments industry
with a number of initiatives, including developments in the
areas of electronic commerce, smart cards and mobile commerce.
MasterCard’s Electronic Commerce Center of Excellence
manages MasterCard’s electronic commerce offerings by
researching and developing a range of emerging technologies that
offer new business opportunities to MasterCard and our
customers. MasterCard’s Chip Centre of Excellence manages
smart card development for MasterCard by working with our
customers to help them replace traditional payment cards relying
solely on magnetic stripe technology with chip-enabled payment
cards. As of December 31, 2004, more than 200 million
smart cards bearing MasterCard’s brands were issued
worldwide. We are also involved in a number of organizations
that facilitate the development and use of smart cards globally,
including EMVCo LLC, a smart cards standards organization, which
maintains specifications that are designed to ensure
interoperability and acceptance of chip-based payment
applications on a worldwide basis. MasterCard’s Mobile and
Wireless Centre of Excellence manages mobile commerce and
wireless payment development by working with customers and
leading technology companies. Finally, MasterCard is working to
develop standards and programs that will allow consumers to
conduct their financial transactions securely using a variety of
new point of interaction devices.

Anti-Fraud Programs

Our customers are responsible for fraud losses associated with
the cards they issue or the merchants from whom they acquire
transactions. However, we have implemented a series of programs
and systems to aid our customers in detecting and preventing the
fraudulent use of cards carrying our brands. Generally, we
charge our customers fees for these anti-fraud programs and
services. We have a number of prevention initiatives targeted at
fraudulent cardholder activity, as well as programs targeted at
merchant fraud. Security and cardholder authentication for
remote channels are particularly critical issues facing
MasterCard’s customers and merchants who engage in
electronic commerce transactions, where a signed cardholder
sales receipt is generally unavailable. MasterCard is seeking to
address these issues through, among other things, the
implementation of MasterCard
SecureCode

tm

,
a global Internet authentication solution that permits
cardholders to authenticate themselves to their issuer through
the use of a unique, personal code, and Site Data Protection, a
program that assists customers and on-line merchants in
protecting electronic commerce sites from hacker intrusions and
subsequent account data compromises.

Marketing

We manage and promote the MasterCard brand for the benefit of
all customers through umbrella advertising, promotional and
sponsorship initiatives. We strive to have our cardholders
associate the MasterCard brand with “The Best Way to Pay
for Everything that Matters®”. Our approach to
marketing activities combines advertising, sponsorships,
promotions, interactive media and public relations as part of an
integrated package designed to increase consumer awareness of
MasterCard and to drive usage of MasterCard cards. We also seek
to tailor our global marketing messages by optimizing their use
in individual countries, while maintaining a common global
theme. Our brand building initiatives, which are conducted for
our benefit as well as for the benefit of our customers,
represent a substantial portion of our overall
expenses — approximately 41% in 2004.

Our advertising plays an important role in building brand
visibility, usage and loyalty among cardholders globally. Our
award-winning “Priceless®” advertising campaign,
launched in the United States in 1997, has run in
48 languages across 96 countries. The
“Priceless” campaign promotes MasterCard’s
acceptance and usage benefits that permit cardholders to pay for
what they need, when they need it. It also provides MasterCard
with a consistent, recognizable message that supports our brand
positioning. In order to promote usage of our cards, we also
sponsor frequent promotions on a regional and national basis,
often in conjunction with merchants or our customers.



We seek to increase MasterCard brand awareness and preference,
and to encourage card usage and loyalty, by sponsoring a variety
of sporting and entertainment properties that support the
“Priceless” campaign and MasterCard brand positioning.
In soccer, MasterCard is the exclusive payment system sponsor of
the FIFA World Cup, which we believe is the single largest
sporting event in the world. We also sponsor other leading
soccer events, including the Union of European Football
Associations (“UEFA”) European Championship and the
UEFA Champions League in Europe. In golf, we are a sponsor and
the preferred card of the PGA Tour, the Champions Tour, the PGA
of America, the LPGA, the European PGA Tour, the PGA Tour of
Australasia, and other events. In baseball, we are the exclusive
payments brand sponsor of Major League Baseball
(“MLB”). We have also established separate marketing
and sponsorship arrangements with over half of the MLB teams. In
football, we have established sponsorship arrangements with the
majority of the National Football League teams. Finally, as part
of our marketing strategy in family entertainment, we have a
long-term sponsorship arrangement with certain business units of
NBC Universal that entitles MasterCard to marketing and
promotional programs with certain of Universal’s motion
picture, theme park, music and video properties.

Merchant Acceptance Initiatives

Based on information from our customers and other sources, we
estimate that, at December 31, 2004, cards carrying
MasterCard brands were accepted at over 24 million
locations around the world. Acceptance locations include
merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be
obtained.

Merchants are an important constituency in the MasterCard
payment system and we are working to further develop our
relationships with them. We believe that consolidation in the
retail industry is producing a set of larger merchants with
increasingly global scope. These merchants are having a
significant impact on all participants in the global payments
industry, including MasterCard. We believe that the growing role
of merchants in the payments system represents both an
opportunity and a challenge for MasterCard. On the one hand,
large merchants are supporting many of the legal and regulatory
threats to interchange that MasterCard is now defending, since
interchange represents a significant component of the costs that
merchants pay to accept payment cards. See “Risk
Factors.” In addition, we may be required to increase the
amount and scope of incentives that we provide to merchants to
encourage the acceptance and usage of our cards, which may
adversely affect our business. On the other hand, we believe
there are many opportunities to enhance our relationships with
merchants and to continue to expand acceptance of our cards,
which provide numerous benefits to merchants. For example, in
2004 we made available directly to merchants those portions of
our rules that apply to card acceptance and related activities,
and we continue to pursue multiple initiatives to encourage
merchant acceptance of our cards.

In the area of acceptance, we aim to maintain the unsurpassed
acceptance of MasterCard-branded programs by focusing on three
core initiatives. First, we seek to increase the number of
payment channels where MasterCard programs are accepted, such as
by introducing MasterCard acceptance in connection with remote
payment applications. Second, we seek to increase the number of
categories of merchants that accept our programs. We are focused
presently on expanding acceptance in electronic commerce
environments, in fast through-put businesses such as fast food
restaurants, and in connection with public sector payments
(including those involving taxes, fees, fines and tolls), among
other categories. Third, we seek to increase usage of our
programs at selected merchants by sponsoring a range of
promotional programs. We also enter into arrangements with
selected merchants under which these merchants provide
incentives or discounts for the use of MasterCard-branded
programs or otherwise indicate a preference for
MasterCard-branded programs when accepting payments from
consumers.

We also support technical initiatives designed to make
MasterCard card acceptance more attractive for specific
merchants, such as our Quick Payment Service for fast food
restaurants and other merchants where rapid transactions are
required. MasterCard
PayPass

tm

,
a “contactless” payment solution that enables
consumers simply to tap or wave their payment card on a
specially equipped terminal, is designed to help our customers
grow their business by capturing transactions that were
previously cash-based and increasing card activity on
underutilized card accounts. In 2004, McDonald’s agreed to
accept PayPass at thousands of its



locations in the United States. PayPass pilot programs have been
expanded to include customers and merchants in the Asia/Pacific
region and Canada.

We view recurring payments as a significant opportunity to
expand MasterCard card acceptance and usage, and we are working
with customers to encourage consumers to make recurring bill
payments in a variety of categories — including
telephone, cable, utilities and insurance — on their
MasterCard-branded cards.

Finally, we provide research, marketing support and financial
assistance to our customers and their partners in connection
with the launch and marketing of co-branded and affinity card
programs. Co-branded cards are payment cards bearing the logos
or other insignia of an issuer and a marketing partner, such as
an airline or retail merchant. Affinity cards are similar to
co-branded cards except that the issuer’s marketing partner
is typically a charity, educational or similar organization.

Membership Standards

We establish and enforce rules and standards surrounding
membership in MasterCard International and the use and
acceptance of cards carrying our brands.

Rule Making and Enforcement

Membership in MasterCard International and its affiliates is
generally open only to banks and other regulated and supervised
financial institutions. Applicants for membership must meet
membership eligibility requirements and must be approved by the
appropriate regional MasterCard board of directors. In general,
MasterCard grants licenses by territory to applicants able to
perform all obligations required of members. Licenses convey
intellectual property rights to members, including access to the
network and usage of MasterCard’s brands. Risk management
reviews and anti-money laundering (“AML”) due
diligence reviews are conducted on all new members prior to
admission, as well as on existing members. All applicants and
members must meet the requirements of MasterCard’s AML
program.

As a condition of our licenses, members agree to comply with our
bylaws, policies, rules and operating regulations
(“Standards”). MasterCard International and certain of
its affiliates are the governing bodies that establish and
enforce the Standards. The Standards relate to such matters as
membership eligibility and financial soundness criteria; the
standards, design and features of cards and card programs; the
use of MasterCard trademarks; merchant acquiring activities
(including acceptance standards applicable to merchants); and
guaranteed settlement, member failures and allocation of losses.

To help ensure that members conform to the Standards, we run a
number of compliance programs including reviewing card programs
proposed by members and requiring members to undergo an annual
audit by an independent certified public accountant (or similar
examination by a regulatory authority). To tailor
MasterCard’s programs and services to the needs of local
markets, our global and/or regional boards have approved a
number of variations to the Standards applicable to specific
regions.

Member Risk Management

As a secondary obligor of certain card obligations of principal
members, we are exposed to member credit risk arising from the
potential financial failure of any of our approximately
2,200 principal members of MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus,
and approximately 3,000 affiliate debit licensees. Principal
members participate directly in MasterCard programs and are
responsible for the settlement and other activities of their
sponsored affiliate members (approximately 21,500).

To minimize the contingent risk to MasterCard of a failure, we
monitor principal members’ and affiliate debit
licensees’ financial health, economic and political
operating environments and compliance with our rules and
standards. If the financial condition of a member or the state
of a national economy in which a member operates indicates that
a member may not be able to satisfy its MasterCard settlement
obligations to other members or its payment obligations to
MasterCard merchants, we may require the member to post
collateral, typically in the form of letters of credit and bank
guarantees. In the event that a member becomes unable or



unwilling to meet its MasterCard settlement and/or program
obligations, we are able to draw upon such member’s
collateral account in order to minimize any potential loss to
our members or ourselves. In addition to obtaining collateral
from members, in situations where a member is potentially unable
to meet its obligations to us or other members, we can block
authorization and settlement of transactions and ultimately
terminate membership.

For liquidity protection in the event of member settlement
failure, we have established a $1.95 billion committed
credit facility, which is subject to annual renewal. In
addition, we have the right to assess all or a portion of our
members for reimbursement for settlement or any other operating
losses, subject to certain limitations set forth in the bylaws
and other Standards of MasterCard. For a description of our
exposure to settlement and travelers cheque risk, see
Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein.

Enterprise Risk Management

MasterCard faces a number of risks in operating its business.
For a description of material risks, see “Risk
Factors.” The extent to which we effectively manage risk is
critical to our financial condition and profitability. Managing
risk is the responsibility of our business units and is an
integral component of our business activities. In 2004, a
dedicated Enterprise Risk Management group was created to
provide risk management analysis, support, coordination and
oversight across the organization. Through enterprise risk
management, we seek to identify, assess, mitigate and monitor
key business risks in a consistent and disciplined manner.

Intellectual Property

We own a number of valuable trademarks that are essential to our
business, including MasterCard®, Maestro® and
Cirrus®, through one or more affiliates. We also own
numerous other trademarks covering various brands, programs and
services offered by MasterCard to support our payment programs.
Through license agreements with our customers, we authorize the
use of our trademarks in connection with our customers’
card issuing and merchant acquiring businesses. In addition, we
own a number of patents and patent applications relating to
payments solutions, transaction processing, smart cards,
security systems and other matters, some of which may be
important to our future business operations.

Competition

MasterCard programs compete against all forms of payment,
including paper-based transactions (principally cash and checks)
and electronic transactions such as wire transfers and Automated
Clearing House (“ACH”) payments. As a result of a
global trend in which electronic forms of payment such as
payment cards are increasingly displacing paper forms of
payment, we have gained market share versus cash and checks in
recent years. However, cash and checks still capture the largest
overall percentage of worldwide transaction volume.

The most common card-based forms of payment are general purpose
cards, which are payment cards carrying logos that permit
widespread usage of the cards within countries, regions or
around the world. General purpose cards may be credit, charge or
deposit access cards. Within the general purpose payment card
industry, we face substantial and increasingly intense
competition worldwide from systems such as Visa (including Plus,
Electron and Interlink), American Express and JCB, among others.
In specific countries, we face significant competition from
other competitors such as Discover/Novus in the United States.
Within the global general purpose card industry, Visa has
significantly greater volume than we do. In certain countries,
other competitors also have leading positions, such as JCB in
Japan. Our deposit access programs also encounter substantial
and increasingly intense competition from ATM and point-of-sale
debit networks in various countries, such as Star, NYCE and
Pulse in the United States and Interac in Canada. We also
encounter competition from businesses such as retail stores and
petroleum (gasoline) companies that issue their own payment
cards.

Our competitors include operators of proprietary end-to-end
payment networks that have direct acquiring relationships with
merchants and direct issuing relationships with cardholders,
such as American Express.



These competitors have certain advantages that we do not enjoy.
Among other things, these competitors do not require formal
interchange fees to balance payment system costs among issuers
and acquirers, because they have direct relationships with both
merchants and cardholders. Interchange fees, which are
characteristics of four-party payments systems such as ours, are
subject to increased regulatory scrutiny worldwide. See
“Risk Factors”. Because they do not utilize formal
interchange fees, operators of end-to-end payment networks to
date have avoided the same regulatory scrutiny we face and,
accordingly, may enjoy a competitive advantage over four-party
payment systems.

In addition, ongoing litigation has and may continue to affect
our ability to compete in the global payments industry. See
Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein.
Under the Settlement Agreement in the U.S. merchant
lawsuit, U.S. merchants now have the right to reject
MasterCard-branded debit cards issued in the United States while
still accepting other MasterCard-branded cards, which may
adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow our debit
business in the United States. In addition, as a result of the
court’s decision in our litigation with the
U.S. Department of Justice concerning our Competitive
Programs Policy, some of our customers may now do business with
American Express or Discover in the United States, which could
adversely affect our business. MBNA Corporation has already
begun to issue American Express Cards to its customers and, in
December 2004, American Express announced that it had reached an
agreement for Citibank to offer American Express credit cards to
Citibank’s customers. Finally, we are being sued in several
state and federal courts because of our currency conversion
practices. The outcome of these lawsuits potentially could
require us to change our currency conversion practices, which
may have a negative impact on our business. We do not know what
the final outcome will be of our various litigations and other
regulatory proceedings.

In addition to proprietary end-to-end networks, we compete
intensely with other bankcard associations, principally Visa,
for the loyalty of our customers. In most countries throughout
the world, including the United States, financial institutions
typically issue both MasterCard- and Visa-branded payment cards.
As a result of this structure, known as “duality”, we
compete with Visa for business on the basis of individual card
portfolios or programs. In some countries, particularly Canada,
card issuers are “non-dual”, meaning that they issue
either MasterCard or Visa payment cards, but not both. Issuance
of MasterCard and Visa debit cards is generally non-dual in the
United States as well, due to Visa’s historical debit
exclusivity rule. As a result of the litigation with the
U.S. Department of Justice, Visa’s debit exclusivity
rule is no longer enforceable. However, Visa enacted a bylaw
that imposes a fee on its 100 largest issuers of debit cards in
the United States if they reduce their Visa debit volume by more
than 10%. In non-dual countries, we compete with Visa for the
entire book of a customer’s business.

Over the last several years, the banking industry has undergone
rapid consolidation, and we expect this trend to continue in the
future. Consolidation represents a competitive threat for
MasterCard because our business strategy contemplates entering
into business agreements with our largest customers in exchange
for significant business commitments to MasterCard. Significant
ongoing consolidation in the banking industry may result in a
financial institution with a substantial MasterCard portfolio
being acquired by an institution that has a strong relationship
with Visa or another competitor, resulting in the loss of
business for MasterCard. In addition, one or more of our
customers could seek to merge with, or acquire, one of our
competitors, and any such transaction could have a material
adverse impact on our business and prospects.

In the United States, we believe that MasterCard-branded
transactions account for a smaller share of all offline,
signature-based debit transactions than they do credit or charge
transactions. In addition, many of our competitors process a
greater number of online, PIN-based debit transactions at the
point of sale than we do, since our Maestro brand has relatively
low market penetration in the United States. In recent years, we
believe that offline and online debit has grown more rapidly
than credit or charge transactions. If we are unable to maintain
and grow our debit business in the United States, the reputation
of our brands and overall business may suffer. In addition, our
business and revenues could be impacted adversely by any
tendency among U.S. consumers or financial institutions to
migrate from offline, signature-based debit transactions to
online, PIN-based transactions, because the latter types of
transactions are more likely to be processed by ATM/debit
point-of-sale networks as opposed to us.



We also face competition from transaction processors such as
First Data Corporation, some of which are seeking to build
networks that link issuers directly with point-of-sale devices
for payment card transaction authorization and processing
services. Certain of these transaction processors (including
First Data) have significantly greater scale than we do, which
may provide them with a cost advantage over us in bidding for
transaction processing business. If these processors grow their
transaction volumes more quickly than we do, there is a risk
that their scale advantages over us may accelerate and they
could capture some of our core processing business. Similarly,
some of our competitors provide currency conversion services at
the point-of-sale through Dynamic Currency Conversion, or DCC,
which is an alternative to the MasterCard currency conversion
system. These networks could reduce our transaction processing
volumes, which could adversely affect our revenues.

We also compete against new entrants that have developed
alternative payment systems. Among other things, these
competitors provide Internet currencies that can be used to buy
and sell goods on-line, “virtual checking” programs
that permit the direct debit of consumer checking accounts for
on-line payments, and services that support payments to and from
proprietary accounts for Internet, mobile commerce and other
applications. A number of these new entrants rely principally on
the Internet to support their services, and may enjoy lower
costs than we do.

In mobile commerce, we face competition from established network
operators, who today manage millions of consumer relationships
and possess key advantages for facilitating payments across
mobile devices. Whereas the MasterCard approach to mobile
commerce centers on the use of the consumer’s payment
account as established by their card issuer, network operators
may apply mobile consumer payments directly to the
customer’s monthly bill.

We believe that the principal factors affecting our competitive
position in the global payments industry are:

Government Regulation

Government regulation impacts key aspects of our business. We
are subject to regulations that affect the payment industry in
the many countries in which our cards are used. In particular,
interchange fees associated with four-party payment systems such
as MasterCard’s are being reviewed or challenged in various
jurisdictions. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements herein.

MasterCard customers are subject to numerous regulations
applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the
United States and elsewhere, and as a consequence MasterCard is
at times impacted by such regulations. Certain of
MasterCard’s operations are periodically reviewed by the
Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. In addition,
aspects of our operations or business may be subject to privacy
regulation in the United States, the European Union and
elsewhere, as well as regulations imposed by the
U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control.
MasterCard Europe operates a retail payment system in Europe and
is subject to oversight by the National Bank of Belgium
(“NBB”) pursuant to standards



published by the European Central Bank. The NBB’s oversight
of MasterCard Europe is principally addressed at managing
financial, legal and operations risk.

MasterCard and other participants in the payment industry are
subject to the regulatory requirements of Section 352(a) of
the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate
Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001
(the “USA PATRIOT Act”). The USA PATRIOT Act has
required MasterCard to create and implement a comprehensive
anti-money laundering program, and has imposed similar
requirements on some of our customers.

Employees

As of December 31, 2004, we employed approximately 4,000
persons, of which approximately 1,200 were employed outside the
United States. We consider our relationship with our employees
to be good.

SEC Reports

Our periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission are available for review on our website at
www.mastercardintl.com. The information contained on our website
is not incorporated by reference into this Report.

Risk Factors

Regulatory Risks

Interchange fees are the subject of increasingly intense
regulatory scrutiny worldwide, which may adversely affect our
business.

Interchange fees are a significant component of the costs that
merchants pay to accept payment cards, and merchants and
regulators are seeking to reduce these costs through litigation
or regulatory action. Accordingly, interchange fees, including
MasterCard’s MIFs, are the subject of increasingly intense
regulatory scrutiny worldwide. For example, in the European
Union, the European Commission has issued a Statement of
Objections challenging MasterCard’s cross-border MIF under
European Union competition rules. If MasterCard is unsuccessful
in obtaining a favorable ruling, the European Commission could
order MasterCard to change the manner in which it calculates its
cross-border MIF. In the United Kingdom, the Office of Fair
Trading (“OFT”) has issued a Statement of Objections
under the U.K. Competition Act 1998 challenging the
MasterCard MIF and multilateral service fee (“MSF”),
claiming that the MIF and MSF infringed U.K. competition
law and do not qualify for an exemption in their present forms.
In Australia, the Reserve Bank of Australia (“RBA”)
has enacted regulations which impose a number of changes on the
operation of four-party credit card systems. In the United
States, a class-action suit has been filed by merchants
alleging, among other things, that our interchange fees violate
federal antitrust laws. Additional litigations with respect to
interchange fees have also been threatened by merchants and
plaintiffs’ lawyers in the United States. Interchange fees
are also being reviewed in a number of other jurisdictions,
including Poland, Spain, New Zealand, Portugal, Mexico,
Colombia, South Africa and Switzerland. We believe that
regulators are increasingly adopting a coordinated approach to
interchange matters, as a result of which developments in any
one jurisdiction may influence regulators’ approach to
interchange in other jurisdictions. See Note 16 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein for a
complete description of these proceedings. We are devoting
substantial management and financial resources to the defense of
MIFs and to the other legal and regulatory challenges we face.

If issuers are unable to collect interchange fees or are forced
to reduce interchange fees, they may be unable to recoup the
costs incurred for their services. This could reduce the number
of financial institutions willing to participate in a four-party
payment card system, lower overall transaction volumes, and/or
make proprietary end-to-end networks (such as those offered by
American Express) or other forms of payment more attractive.
Issuers could also attempt to balance the expense of their card
programs by seeking a reduction in the fees that we charge. If
MasterCard is less successful than Visa in defending interchange
fees, we could also be competitively disadvantaged against Visa.
In Australia, we believe that the RBA’s regulations



have already benefited our competitors operating proprietary
end-to-end networks. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in our
defense of our and our members’ interchange fees,
regulation of interchange fees could have an adverse impact on
our revenues, our prospects for future growth, and our overall
business.

In addition to interchange fees, the payments industry is
the subject of increased regulatory focus in the United States
and elsewhere, which may impose costly new compliance burdens on
MasterCard and its customers and lead to decreased transaction
volumes through MasterCard’s systems.

Regulation of the payments industry, including regulation
applicable to MasterCard and our customers, has increased
significantly in recent years. For example, in 2002 MasterCard
became subject to the regulatory requirements of
Section 352(a) of the USA PATRIOT Act. The USA PATRIOT Act
has required MasterCard to create and implement a comprehensive
anti-money laundering program, and has imposed similar
requirements on our customers. The U.S. Congress is
presently considering regulatory initiatives in the areas of
Internet gambling, Internet prescription drug purchases,
copyright and trademark infringement and privacy, among others,
that could impose additional compliance burdens on MasterCard or
our customers. Most states in the U.S. are considering a
variety of legislation as well. Various regulatory agencies are
also considering regulations covering identity theft, account
maintenance guidelines, privacy, disclosure rules, security and
marketing that would impact our customers directly. In 2004, a
number of regulations were issued implementing the Fair and
Accurate Credit Transactions Act, or FACT Act, which, among
other things, makes permanent the preemptive effect of several
key provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act that could have
a material impact on our customers’ businesses. Additional
implementing regulations are anticipated in 2005. In addition,
privacy and data use and security are issues of sensitivity to
regulators and legislators and we and our members could be
impacted by attempts to regulate such issues.

Outside of the United States, a number of jurisdictions have
begun implementing legal frameworks to regulate their domestic
payment systems. For examples, regulators in Mexico and Malaysia
have recently been given statutory authority to regulate certain
respects of the payments systems in those countries, and similar
initiatives have been proposed in Singapore and elsewhere. At
present, it is not possible to predict the impact of these
developments on MasterCard’s business or prospects.

Increased regulatory focus on MasterCard may increase our costs,
which would negatively impact our financial performance.
Similarly, increased regulatory focus on our customers may cause
them to reduce the volume of transactions processed through our
systems, which would reduce our revenues and also negatively
impact our financial performance.

Litigation Risks

As a result of the Court’s decision in our litigation
with the U.S. Department of Justice, we have repealed our
Competitive Programs Policy and our business may suffer as a
result.

In 1998, the United States Department of Justice
(“DOJ”) filed suit against MasterCard International,
Visa U.S.A., Inc. and Visa International Corp. in the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York
alleging that certain aspects of the governance of MasterCard
and Visa were unlawful, and that MasterCard’s Competitive
Programs Policy (“CPP”) and a Visa bylaw provision
that prohibited financial institutions participating in the
respective associations from issuing competing proprietary
payment cards (such as American Express or Discover) acted to
restrain competition. Although we were successful in defending
our governance structure at trial, the Second Circuit Court of
Appeals affirmed the trial court judge’s ruling that our
CPP and Visa’s bylaw constituted unlawful restraints of
trade under the U.S. federal antitrust laws. After the
U.S. Supreme Court denied our petition for certiorari on
October 4, 2004, thereby exhausting all avenues for further
appeal in this case, we repealed the CPP. As a result, our
issuers are now permitted to issue general purpose credit or
debit cards in the United States on any other general purpose
card network (such as American Express or Discover). The repeal
of the CPP could cause our members to issue fewer cards with our
brand and enter into arrangements with our competitors to issue
cards, thereby reducing the volume of transactions that we
process. MBNA Corporation has already begun to issue American
Express Cards to its customers and in December 2004 American
Express announced that it had reached an agreement for Citibank
to offer American Express credit cards to Citibank’s
customers. Similarly, Discover announced



that GE Finance will issue Wal-mart branded cards that will run
on the Discover network. Accordingly, the repeal of the CPP
could have an adverse affect on our business and revenues. See
Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein.

If we are found liable in any of the cases brought by
American Express or Discover, we may be forced to pay damages,
which may have an adverse effect on our revenues.

After the Supreme Court denied our petition for a writ of
certiorari of the decision in our litigation with the DOJ,
Discover and American Express, respectively, filed suit against
MasterCard Incorporated, MasterCard International Incorporated,
Visa U.S.A., Inc. and Visa International Services Association
alleging that the CPP and Visa’s bylaw provision caused
each injury by unlawfully restraining trade under the
U.S. federal antitrust laws. Discover also alleges that it
suffered injury by reason of MasterCard’s rules which
required merchants in the U.S. to accept MasterCard-branded
debit cards if they accepted other MasterCard products, before
these rules were modified as part of the U.S. merchant
lawsuit. American Express also names a number of member banks as
co-defendants.

If we are unsuccessful in defending against these lawsuits, we
may have to pay treble damages, which could have an adverse
effect on our business. See Note 16 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements herein for a description of these and our
other material legal proceedings.

Visa’s settlement service fee and the ability of
U.S. merchants to not accept MasterCard-branded debit cards
as a result of the settlement of the U.S. merchant lawsuit
could adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow our
debit card business in the United States.

In June 2003, Visa enacted a bylaw requiring its 100 largest
issuers of debit cards in the United States to pay a so-called
“settlement service fee” if the issuers reduce their
debit Visa volume by more than 10%. This bylaw was later
modified to clarify that the settlement service fee would only
be imposed if an issuer shifted its portfolio of debit cards to
MasterCard. Visa implemented this bylaw provision following the
settlement of the U.S. merchant lawsuit. See Note 14
to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. For a
description of MasterCard’s response to this bylaw
provision, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements herein. If Visa is permitted to impose this
settlement service fee on issuers of debit cards according to
this bylaw, it would penalize Visa members seeking to do debit
business with MasterCard and would effectively prohibit them
from converting their debit card programs to the MasterCard
brand. In addition, under the Settlement Agreement in the
U.S. merchant lawsuit, merchants have the right to reject
MasterCard-branded debit cards in the United States, while still
accepting other MasterCard-branded cards and vice versa. Either
of these scenarios would be detrimental to MasterCard’s
ability to maintain and grow its debit card business in the
United States.

If we are ultimately unsuccessful in any of our various
lawsuits relating to our currency conversion practices, or if
Dynamic Currency Conversion services reduce the volume of
foreign currency transactions we process, our business may be
adversely affected.

We generate a significant amount of revenue from processing
foreign currency transactions for members. However, we are
defendants in several state and federal lawsuits alleging that
our currency conversion practices are deceptive,
anti-competitive or otherwise unlawful. A trial judge in
California has found that our currency conversion practice is
deceptive under California state law, and ordered that we
mandate that members disclose the currency conversion process to
cardholders in cardholder agreements, applications,
solicitations and monthly billing statements. The judge also
ordered unspecified restitution to California cardholders. The
final judgment and restitution process have been stayed pending
MasterCard’s appeal. In addition, we have been served with
similar complaints in several state courts seeking to, in
effect, extend the judge’s decision to MasterCard
cardholders outside of California. We have succeeded in having
several of these cases transferred to the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York and combined with
putative federal class actions alleging that our currency
conversion practices violate federal antitrust laws. See
Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein.

If we are unsuccessful in defending against these lawsuits, we
may have to pay restitution to cardholders who make claims that
they used their cards in another country, or may otherwise be
required to modify our



currency conversion practices. In addition, some of our
competitors provide currency conversion services at the point of
sale (known as Dynamic Currency Conversion or DCC) which, if
chosen by the cardholder, could replace our own currency
conversion processing services. If we are forced to change our
pricing or practices for our currency conversion processing, or
if we process fewer transactions because of competing DCC
services or otherwise, our business would be adversely affected.

If we are found liable in any of the other material
litigations that have been brought against us, we may be forced
to pay damages and/or change our business practices or pricing
structure, any of which could have an adverse effect on our
revenues.

There are currently actions against MasterCard International in
19 different state courts and the District of Columbia. In a
number of these state courts there are multiple complaints
against MasterCard International brought under state unfair
competition statutes on behalf of putative classes of consumers.
The claims in these actions mirror the allegations made in the
U.S. merchant lawsuit and assert that merchants, faced with
excessive merchant discount fees, have passed these overcharges
to consumers in the form of higher prices on goods and services
sold. The consumer class actions are not covered by the terms of
the Settlement Agreement described in Notes 14 and 16 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. In addition to
these litigations, we are also being sued in U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of New York, the Superior Court
of California and in the District Court of Rhode Island in
connection with our assessment of chargeback transactions. We
may also be sued in the future in the United States or in other
jurisdictions by our customers, merchants or consumers for
substantial damages or injunctive relief in connection with our
business practices.

If we are unsuccessful in our defense against the consumer class
actions, the merchant chargeback litigations, or any other
material litigation, we may be forced to pay damages and/or
change our business practices and pricing structure, any of
which could have an adverse affect on our business. See
Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for
a description of these and our other material legal proceedings.

Other Risks

We face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the
prices we charge our customers, which may adversely affect our
revenues and profitability.

We generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers
for providing transaction processing and other payment services,
and from assessments on the dollar volume of activity on cards
carrying our brands. Some of our competitors are larger or have
greater financial resources than we do. In addition, continued
consolidation in the banking industry is producing a smaller
number of larger customers, which generally have a greater
ability to negotiate pricing discounts with MasterCard. In
addition, we seek to enter into business agreements with
customers through which we offer incentives and other support to
issue and promote our cards. In order to stay competitive, we
may have to increase the amount of these incentives. Also, as
merchants consolidate and become increasingly larger we may be
required to increase the amount of incentives that we provide to
merchants. To date, our rapid overall volume growth has allowed
us to mitigate the impact of pricing reductions or incentive
increases. However, we may not be able to process additional
transaction volume or provide additional services to our
customers to compensate for such lower fees or increased costs
in the future, which would adversely affect our revenues and
profitability. In addition, increased pressure on prices
enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity
initiatives in areas other than those relating to customer
incentives. We may not be successful in these efforts.

Global economic, political and other conditions may
adversely affect trends in cross-border travel, which may
significantly impact our revenues and profitability.

The global payments industry is heavily dependent upon the
overall level of consumer spending. A sustained deterioration in
general economic conditions, particularly in the United States
or Europe, or increases in interest rates in key countries in
which we operate, may adversely affect our financial performance
by reducing the number or average purchase amount of
transactions involving payment cards carrying our brands. In
addition, a significant portion of the volume generated on cards
carrying our brands (and a



significant portion of the revenues we earn outside the United
States) are associated with cross-border business and leisure
travel, which may be adversely affected by world geopolitical
and other conditions. In particular, revenues from processing
foreign currency transactions for our customers fluctuate with
cross border travel and are impacted by changes in foreign
currency exchange rates.

We are significantly dependent on our relationships with
our customers to manage the MasterCard payment system. If we are
unable to maintain our relationships with our customers, or if
our customers are unable to maintain their relationships with
cardholders or with the merchants that accept our cards for
payment, our business may be adversely affected.

We are, and will continue to be, significantly dependent on our
relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their further
relationships with cardholders and merchants to support our
programs and services. Most of our relationships with our
customers are not exclusive and may be terminated at the
convenience of our customers. Our customers can reassess their
commitments to us at any time in the future and/or develop their
own competitive services. In particular, the payments industry
is currently undergoing significant consolidations and the
merger of one or more of our customers with financial
institutions aligned with our competitors could have a material
adverse impact on our business and prospects. In 2004,
JP Morgan Chase Bank and its affiliates contributed over
10% of our consolidated revenues. Loss of business from
JP Morgan Chase Bank or another large customer could
adversely affect our business.

Our business strategy calls for us to grow our business by,
among other things, entering into customized agreements with
customers around the globe. Like our other customer
relationships, these agreements are terminable by our customers
in a variety of circumstances.

A number of our key customers are represented on our board of
directors. If any one of these customers were to lose its
representation on the board, this could have a detrimental
effect on our business relationship with that customer.
Conversely, a number of customers from which we earn substantial
revenues are principally aligned with one of our competitors. A
significant loss of revenues or transaction volumes from these
customers could have an adverse impact on our business.

In addition, until October 15, 2006, we are required to
permit issuers with which we have entered into business
agreements in the United States before October 15, 2004 to
terminate those agreements without penalty in order to enter
into agreements with American Express or Discover as a result of
the antitrust litigation that was brought against us by the DOJ,
which is described in a separate risk factor above. Accordingly,
our business agreements with customers may not reduce the risk
inherent in our business that customers may terminate their
relationships with us in favor of our competitors, or for other
reasons, or might not meet their contractual obligations to us.

We do not issue cards, set cardholder fees or determine the
interest rates (if applicable) charged to cardholders using
cards that carry our brands. Each MasterCard issuer is
responsible for determining these and most other competitive
card features. In addition, we do not solicit merchants to
process transactions or establish the discount rate that
merchants are charged for card acceptance, which are
responsibilities of our acquirers. As a result, much of our
business depends on the continued success and competitiveness of
our customers. In turn, our customers’ success is dependent
upon a variety of factors over which we have little or no
influence. If our customers become financially unstable, we may
lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk as
described below.

Outside of the United States and a select number of other
jurisdictions, most in-country (as opposed to cross-border)
transaction activity conducted with MasterCard, Maestro and
Cirrus cards is authorized, cleared and settled by our customers
or other processors without the involvement of MasterCard’s
central processing systems. Because we do not provide domestic
processing services in these countries and do not, as described
above, have direct relationships with cardholders or merchants,
we are dependent on our close working relationships with our
customers to effectively manage the MasterCard brand, together
with the perception of the MasterCard payment system, among
regulators, merchants and consumers in these countries. From
time to time, our customers may take actions that we do not
believe to be in the best interests of the MasterCard payment
system overall, which may adversely impact our business.



We rely on the continuing expansion of merchant acceptance of
our brands and programs. Although it is our business strategy to
invest in strengthening our brands and expanding our acceptance
network, there can be no guarantee that our efforts in these
areas will continue to be successful. If the rate of merchant
acceptance growth slows or reverses itself, our business could
suffer.

Our operating results may suffer because of substantial
and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global
payments industry.

The global payments industry is highly competitive. Some of our
competitors have developed, or may develop, substantially
greater financial and other resources than we have, may offer a
wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use
more effective advertising and marketing strategies to achieve
broader brand recognition or merchant acceptance than we have.
We may not continue to be able to compete effectively against
these threats. In addition, as discussed under the heading
“Competition”, our business faces a number of specific
and increasingly intense competitive pressures worldwide. We may
not be able to continue to effectively address these competitive
pressures in the future. As a result, our revenues or income may
decline.

As a secondary obligor of certain obligations of principal
members and affiliate debit licensees, we are exposed to risk of
loss in the event that any of our members default on their
MasterCard, Cirrus or Maestro settlement obligations.

MasterCard settlement exposure materializes when an issuer or
acquirer fails to fund its daily settlement obligations due to
technical reasons, liquidity shortfall, insolvency or other
reasons. We quantify each member’s settlement credit risk
exposure by estimating the dollar value of issuing and
chargeback transactions that we would have to fund in order to
satisfy such member’s MasterCard, Maestro or Cirrus-related
obligations to other members. If a principal member or affiliate
debit licensee is unable to fulfill its settlement obligations
to other members, we may bear the loss, even if we do not
process the transaction. In addition, although we are not
contractually obligated to do so, we may elect to keep merchants
whole in the event that an acquirer defaults on its merchant
payment obligations, in order to maintain the integrity and
acceptance of our brands. Accordingly, one or more member
defaults could expose us to significant losses and reduce our
net income. For more information on our settlement exposure, see
Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein.

If we are not able to keep pace with the rapid
technological developments in our industry to provide customers,
merchants and cardholders with new and innovative payment
programs and services, the use of MasterCard-branded cards could
decline, which would reduce our revenues and income.

The payment card industry is subject to rapid and significant
technological changes, such as continuing developments of
technologies in the areas of smart cards, radio frequency and
proximity payment devices, electronic commerce and mobile
commerce, among others. We cannot predict the effect of
technological changes on our business. We rely in part on third
parties, including some of our competitors and potential
competitors, for the development of and access to new
technologies. We expect that new services and technologies
applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge, and
these new services and technologies may be superior to, or
render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our card
programs and services. Our future success will depend, in part,
on our ability to develop or adapt to technological changes and
evolving industry standards and to provide end-to-end payment
solutions for our customers.

If our transaction processing systems are disrupted or we
are unable to process transactions securely, efficiently or at
all, our revenues or income would be materially reduced.

Our transaction authorization, clearing and settlement systems
may experience service interruptions as a result of fire,
natural disasters, power loss, disruptions in long distance or
local telecommunications access, terrorism or accident. Most of
our transaction processing systems are operated out of a single
facility, supported by a separate co-processing facility. A
natural disaster or other problem at our primary and/or back-up
facilities or our other owned or leased facilities could
interrupt our services. Additionally, we rely on third- party
service providers, such as AT&T, for the timely transmission
of information across our global data transportation network. If
a service provider fails to provide the communications capacity
or services we



require, as a result of natural disaster, operational
disruption, terrorism or any other reason, the failure could
interrupt our services and adversely affect the perception of
our brands’ reliability and our revenues or income.

In addition, our security protection measures, including with
respect to the security of transaction information processed on
our systems or the systems or processing technology of third
parties participating in our network, may not be sufficient to
prevent the fraudulent or other improper use of cards carrying
our brands. Unauthorized use of our network potentially could
jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in
our computer systems or transmitted by our customers or others.
These factors may result in liabilities for us or our customers,
and could reduce our revenues and income.

Adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange
controls could decrease revenues we receive from our
international operations.

During 2004, approximately 42% of our revenues were generated
from activities outside the United States. Some of the revenues
we generate outside the United States are subject to
unpredictable and indeterminate fluctuations if the values of
international currencies change relative to the
U.S. dollar. Resulting exchange gains and losses are
included in our net income. Our risk management activities
provide protection with respect to adverse changes in the value
of only a limited number of currencies. Furthermore, we may
become subject to exchange control regulations that might
restrict or prohibit the conversion of our revenue currencies
into U.S. dollars. The occurrence of any of these factors
could have a adverse impact on our business.

Item 2.

Properties

As of December 31, 2004, MasterCard and its subsidiaries
owned or leased 57 properties. We own our corporate
headquarters, a three-story, 472,600 square foot building
located in Purchase, New York. There is no outstanding debt on
this building. Our principal technology and operations center is
a 528,000 square foot leased facility located in
O’Fallon, Missouri, known as “Winghaven”. The
term of the lease on this facility is 10 years, which
commenced on August 31, 1999. See Note 12 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements herein. Our leased properties
in the United States are located in 11 states and in the
District of Columbia. We also lease properties in 36 other
countries. These facilities primarily consist of corporate and
regional offices, as well as our operations centers.

We believe that our facilities are suitable and adequate for the
business that we currently conduct. However, we periodically
review our space requirements and may acquire new space to meet
the needs of our business, or consolidate and dispose of
facilities that are no longer required.

PART II

Item 5.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related
    Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity
    Securities

There is currently no established public trading market for the
common stock of MasterCard Incorporated. There were
approximately 1,136 holders of record of the Class A
redeemable and Class B convertible common stock of
MasterCard Incorporated as of February 9, 2005. We normally
do not pay any cash dividends on our common stock and intend to
retain future earnings to fund the development and growth of our
business. Accordingly, we do not anticipate paying cash
dividends in the future. Payment of future



dividends, if any, would be at the discretion of our board of
directors after taking into account various factors, including
our financial condition, settlement guarantees, assessment
rights, operating results and current and anticipated cash
needs. The common stock of MasterCard Incorporated is not
currently authorized to be issued in connection with any
compensation plan.

During the period covered by this Report, MasterCard
Incorporated did not make any sales of its equity securities
that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended. In addition, MasterCard did not purchase or arrange for
the purchase of any of its equity securities registered under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, during the
period covered by this Report.

Item 6.

Selected Financial Data

On June 28, 2002, we converted from a membership to a stock
company through the creation of MasterCard Incorporated, a new
holding company. Also on June 28, 2002, MasterCard
Incorporated directly and indirectly acquired all of the
outstanding stock of Europay International S.A.
(“EPI”) in a transaction that we refer to as the
“Integration”. On July 16, 2002, EPI was renamed
MasterCard Europe S.A. On September 30, 2002, MasterCard
Europe was reorganized in Belgium as MasterCard Europe sprl.
Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein
more fully describes these transactions.

The selected consolidated financial data presented below as of
and for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002
were derived from the audited consolidated financial statements
of MasterCard Incorporated. The results of MasterCard
Europe’s operations have been included in our consolidated
statements of operations from June 28, 2002 to present. The
data set forth below should be read in conjunction with, and are
qualified by reference to, “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” and the Consolidated Financial Statements and
Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Report.

Set forth below are tables that provide information regarding
the performance results for the years ended December 31,
2004 and 2003 for the payment programs of MasterCard
International and MasterCard Europe, the principal operating
subsidiaries of MasterCard Incorporated. The information
regarding MasterCard’s payment programs for the year ended
December 31, 2003 has been restated to present the
information on the same basis as the information in the table
for the year ended December 31, 2004.



The information set forth in the GDV, purchase volume, purchase
transactions, cash volume and cash transactions columns of the
tables is derived from information provided by MasterCard
members that is subject to logical and statistical verification
by MasterCard and partial cross-checking against information
provided by MasterCard’s transaction processing systems.
The data set forth in the accounts and card columns is derived
from information provided by MasterCard members and is subject
to certain limited logical and statistical verification by
MasterCard. All data is subject to revision and amendment by
MasterCard’s members subsequent to the date of its release.
Accordingly, 2003 data has been updated to reflect new
information from the time of its previous release. Growth rates
over prior periods are provided for volume-based data. European
activity is included for the periods presented.

A portion of the data set forth in the accounts and cards
columns reflects the impact of routine portfolio changes among
members and other practices that may lead to over counting of
the underlying data in certain circumstances.

For purposes of the tables: GDV represents purchase volume plus
cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfers and
convenience checks; purchase volume means the aggregate dollar
amount of purchases made with MasterCard-branded cards for the
relevant period; and cash volume means the aggregate dollar
amount of cash disbursements obtained with MasterCard-branded
cards for the relevant period. The number of cards includes
virtual cards, which are MasterCard-branded payment accounts for
which functional cards are not generally issued.

The MasterCard payment product is comprised of both credit
programs and offline debit programs; certain data relating to
each type of program is included in the tables. Credit programs
include MasterCard-branded credit and charge programs. Offline
debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where
the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale
is for cardholders to sign a sales receipt.

Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by
applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange
rate for each local currency in which MasterCard volumes are
reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly
basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. However,
MasterCard reports period-over-period rates of change in GDV,
purchase volume and cash volume solely on the basis of local
currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of
changes in the value of foreign currencies against the
U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.
Accordingly, the period-over-period rates of change set forth in
the tables cannot be extrapolated directly by reference to
dollar volume information presented by MasterCard for the
current and historical periods.

The tables include information with respect to
MasterCard-branded transactions that are not processed by
MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn
revenues. Maestro and Cirrus online debit transactions, Mondex
transactions and other branded transactions are not included in
the tables.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with
the consolidated financial statements and notes of MasterCard
Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including
MasterCard International Incorporated (“MasterCard
International”) and MasterCard Europe sprl
(“MasterCard Europe”)(together, “MasterCard”
or the “Company”) included elsewhere in this
Report.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking
statements pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this
Report, the words “believe,” “expect,”
“could,” “may,” “will” and similar
words are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These
statements relate to our future prospects, developments and
business strategies. Many factors and uncertainties relating to
our operations and business environment, all of which are
difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our
control, influence whether any forward-looking statements can or
will be achieved. Any one of those factors could cause our
actual results to differ materially from those expressed or
implied in writing in any forward-looking statements made by
MasterCard or on its behalf. We believe there are certain risk
factors that are important to our business, and that could cause
actual results to differ from our expectations. Please see a
complete discussion of these risk factors under the caption
“Risk Factors” in Item 1 — Business of
this Report.

Overview

Our corporate strategy has been to focus on our key customers to
drive our business growth; to strengthen our brands, technology
and acceptance network; and to differentiate MasterCard from our
competition by developing innovative payment solutions and
customized consulting services. We remain committed to this
strategic direction and have begun to implement initiatives to
expand our customer-focused approach to a broader group of
customers, as well as to further develop relationships with
merchants that accept our cards. We will also seek to leverage
our expertise in payment programs, consulting services, brand
marketing, technology and processing to expand the value-added
services we provide our customers. We also intend to proactively
address the legal, regulatory and other industry risks that
impact our business.

In a challenging operating environment with legal, economic and
industry pressures, we were able to exceed our planned revenue
growth and attain our expense objectives in 2004. We achieved
double-digit revenue growth of 14% in 2004 from the comparable
period in 2003, adjusted for a 2% impact of favorable foreign
currency fluctuation against the euro. The increase in revenue
was due to higher gross dollar volume (“GDV”) and more
transactions processed by MasterCard, primarily from the
expansion of our customer relationships, economic recovery in
many countries and higher cross-border travel. In 2003, our
revenues were negatively impacted by the war in Iraq, the SARS
outbreak, reduced travel and a general economic slowdown
worldwide. During 2004, we continued to realign our operations
and limit the growth of our operating expenses through
successful vendor negotiations. Our operating expenses increased
7% in 2004, excluding the impact of the U.S. merchant
lawsuit and other legal settlements, of which 1% was due to the
impact of acquisitions during 2004. In 2004, the translation of
MasterCard Europe’s operating results from euro into
U.S. dollar combined with the devaluation of the
U.S. dollar compared to the euro resulted in a 2% increase
in both revenues and operating expenses compared to 2003. We
reduced our operating expenses as a percentage of



total revenues to 86% from 93% in 2003, excluding the impact of
the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements.

Our financial position reflects strong liquidity. We have
$1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available for
sale securities and $975 million in stockholders’
equity as of December 31, 2004. We intend to continue to
focus on building our financial position. We believe our cash
from operations will be sufficient to fund our initiatives to
accelerate our profitable growth and to enhance the global
position of MasterCard in 2005.

We successfully completed our Sarbanes-Oxley 404 testing one
year ahead of the required deadline for non-accelerated filers
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The
consolidated financial statements herein include a report from
management which concludes that, based on our assessment, our
internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of
December 31, 2004.

Results of Operations

** — Not meaningful

The acquisition of MasterCard Europe (formerly Europay
International S.A. (“EPI”)), on June 28, 2002,
affected the comparability of our financial data. The results of
MasterCard Europe’s operations have



been included in our consolidated statements of operations from
June 28, 2002. However, MasterCard Europe’s GDV and
transactions are included in all periods.

Impact of Foreign Currency Rates

Our operations are impacted by changes in foreign currency
exchange rates. Quarterly assessment fees are calculated based
on local dollar volume which is converted to U.S. dollar
volume using average exchange rates for the quarter. In 2004,
the increase in GDV of 14% on a U.S. dollar converted basis
exceeded local GDV growth of 11%, resulting in increased
assessment revenues due to the devaluation of the
U.S. dollar. In addition, consumer behavior, particularly
international travel and purchases, varies with changes in
foreign currency exchange rates.

We are especially impacted by the movements of the euro to the
U.S. dollar since MasterCard Europe’s functional
currency is the euro. The devaluation of the U.S. dollar
against the euro and the impact of the translation of MasterCard
Europe’s operating results into U.S. dollar amounts
are summarized below:

Revenues

Our revenues are generated from the fees that we charge our
customers for providing transaction processing and other payment
services, and from assessments calculated on the dollar volume
of activity on cards carrying our brands. We establish standards
and procedures for the acceptance and settlement of our customer
transactions on a global basis. We do not issue cards, set fees,
or determine the interest rates consumers will be charged on
cards carrying our brands. Our issuing customers have the
responsibility for determining these and most other competitive
card features. Our revenues are based upon transactional
information accumulated by our systems or reported by our
customers. Certain revenues are estimated based upon aggregate
transaction information and projected customer performance.

MasterCard enters into business agreements with certain
customers that provide for fee rebates when those customers meet
certain performance based criteria. Such rebates are calculated
on a monthly basis based upon estimated performance and the
discounted rates for the services provided. In addition,
MasterCard enters into agreements with certain customers and
merchants to provide GDV-based and other performance support
incentives. Rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction
of revenue in the same period as the revenue is earned or the
performance has occurred.

The U.S. remains our largest geographic market based on
revenues. However, international revenues grew at a faster rate
than U.S. revenues in 2004, particularly in the European
region. Accordingly, revenue generated in the U.S. was
approximately 58%, 63% and 61% of total revenues in 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively. The growth in the European region is
primarily due to new assessment revenue streams and increased
transactions. No individual country, other than the U.S.,
generated more than 10% of total revenues in either period.

In addition to the expansion of our business relationships and
the global recovery in cross-border travel, we believe that our
2004 revenue growth was positively impacted by the worldwide
trend in which payments are migrating from paper-based forms to
electronic forms such as payment cards. This trend has helped
drive our volume and revenue growth for a number of years, and
we expect it to continue in 2005. However, we expect our net
revenue growth in 2005 to be moderated by pricing arrangements
with certain large customers.



These pricing arrangements reflect enhanced competition in the
global payments industry and the continued consolidation and
globalization of our key customers and merchants.

Operations Fees

Operations fees primarily represent user fees for authorization,
clearing, settlement and other payment services that facilitate
transaction and information management among our customers on a
global basis. Operations fees increased $206 million or 14%
in 2004 and $199 million or 16% in 2003, in each case
compared to the prior year. The acquisition of MasterCard Europe
accounted for $111 million or 56% of the increase in
operations fees in 2003. The significant changes in operations
fees were as follows:



Assessments

Assessments are charges that are calculated based on our
customers’ GDV. GDV represents gross usage (purchase and
cash disbursements) on cards carrying our brands for goods and
services including balance transfers and convenience checks. In
2004 and 2003, assessments revenue grew $156 million, or
20% and $140 million, or 21%, respectively. GDV growth was
11% and 6% in 2004 and 2003, respectively, when measured in
local currency and 14% and 10%, respectively, when measured on a
U.S. dollar converted basis. The acquisition of MasterCard
Europe accounted for $94 million or 68% of the increase in
assessments in 2003; excluding MasterCard Europe, assessments
revenue growth was 8% in 2003.

In addition to the increase in GDV, assessments grew due to the
following factors:

•

In certain countries in Europe and Latin America, our customers
    are charged a marketing assessment fee based on volume. These
    fees are used by MasterCard to expand new and existing market
    development programs to promote the MasterCard brand in these
    countries. These fees, which were extended to additional
    countries in 2003 and 2004, increased $28 million or 37% in
    2004 and $49 million or 185% in 2003.

•

Assessment rates vary based on the nature of the transactions
    that generate the GDV. In 2004, there was stronger growth in
    international volumes and purchase volumes, which are assessed
    at higher rates than domestic volumes and cash volumes,
    respectively.

As described above, rebates and incentives provided to our
customers and merchants increased in 2004 and 2003. These
rebates and incentives reduce revenue, moderate assessments
growth and are generally based on GDV, as well as a fixed
component for the issuance of new cards or the launch of new
programs. Rebates and incentives increased $29 million and
$72 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Rebates and
incentives as a percentage of gross assessments were 29% and 31%
in 2004 and 2003, respectively. During 2004 and 2003, we
increased the incentives offered to certain customers and
merchants to promote usage and acceptance of our brands.
Additionally, the increase in rebates in 2003 can be attributed
to the addition of new member contracts by MasterCard Europe
subsequent to its acquisition by MasterCard.



Operating Expenses

Our operating expenses are comprised of general and
administrative, advertising and market development,
U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements and
depreciation and amortization expenses. In 2004, there was a
decrease in operating expenses of $587 million or 21%
compared to the prior year. Excluding the charges to earnings
related to the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal
settlements, there would have been an increase in operating
expenses of $154 million or 7% in 2004 compared to the
prior year. Approximately $31 million of the increase in
2004 related to the acquisition of the two consulting firms
described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements herein. In 2003, there was an increase in operating
expenses of $1.1 billion or 62% compared to the prior year,
of which $763 million or 70% was a result of the
U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements and
$197 million or 18% was due to the acquisition of
MasterCard Europe.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of
personnel, professional fees, data processing,
telecommunications and travel. In 2004 and 2003, these
activities accounted for approximately 46% and 49% of total
revenues, respectively. General and administrative expenses
increased $87 million in 2004 and $134 million in
2003, primarily due to increases in personnel expenses. The
acquisition of MasterCard Europe accounted for $110 million
or 82% of the increase in general and administrative expenses in
2003. The major components of changes in general and
administrative expenses are as follows:

Advertising and Market Development

Advertising and market development consists of expenses
associated with advertising, marketing, promotions and
sponsorships, which promote our brand and assist our customers
in achieving their goals by raising consumer awareness and usage
of cards carrying our brands. In 2004 and 2003, these activities
accounted for approximately 35% and 38% of total revenues,
respectively. Advertising and market development expenses
increased $65 million or 8% in 2004 and $157 million
or 23% in 2003. The acquisition of MasterCard Europe accounted
for $70 million or 45% of the increase in advertising and
market development expenses in 2003.

Our brands, principally MasterCard, are valuable strategic
assets which convey symbols that can be readily identified by
our customers, as well as our cardholders, creating value for
our business. Our advertising and marketing efforts are focused
on ensuring that our services are identified, communicated and
marketed in a clear, efficient and consistent manner, not only
on a local level, but also on a global scale. We are committed
to maintaining and enhancing our MasterCard brand reputation,
image and ultimate value. Our “Priceless” campaign has
run in 96 countries and 48 languages and we continue
to invest significantly in this campaign. In 2004, increased
media advertising occurred in our European region. In addition,
MasterCard has corporate sponsorships and conducts promotions to
generate usage of cards carrying our brands. During 2004 and
2003, we sponsored the UEFA Champions League, certain National
Football League teams, Major League Baseball, the Professional
Golf Association and Universal Studios.

MasterCard implemented a four-year plan in 2002 to accelerate
our growth and to enhance the global position of MasterCard and
its customers by significantly expanding its spending in
advertising and market development. For the year ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003, we spent $192 million and
$152 million on advertising and marketing relating to this
plan. The primary focus of these initiatives is to build brand
recognition, promote brand acceptance and enhance the
development of our programs and services in certain markets. We
will continue to evaluate the extent of these initiatives in
light of changing market conditions.

Merchant Lawsuit and Other Legal Settlements

In the first quarter of 2003, we recorded a pre-tax charge of
$721 million ($469 million after-tax) consisting of
(i) the monetary amount of the U.S. merchant lawsuit
settlement (discounted at 8 percent over the payment term),
(ii) certain additional costs in connection with, and in
order to comply with, other requirements of the
U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement, and (iii) costs to
address the merchants who opted not to participate in the
plaintiff class in the U.S. merchant lawsuit. The
$721 million pre-tax charge amount was an estimate, which
was subsequently revised based on the approval of the
U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement agreement by the court,
and other factors. In addition, other legal settlements were
made in 2004 and 2003. Total liabilities for the
U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements changed
as follows:



Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $2 million
in 2004 and $29 million in 2003. In 2003, depreciation and
amortization expense increased significantly due to the
acquisition of MasterCard Europe as well as additional
capitalized computer software. The acquisition of MasterCard
Europe accounted for $17 million or 59% of the increase in
depreciation and amortization in 2003.

Our business is dependent on the technology that we use to
process transactions. This technology is continuously updated
and improved. Therefore, our investment in capitalized software
and related amortization also continues to increase. In recent
years we have made the following significant changes to our
technology and technology centers, which have caused an increase
in our depreciation and amortization:

•

During 2003, our co-processing technology center was moved from
    Lake Success, NY to Kansas City, MO. The cost of the new
    facility and equipment was $36 million.

•

During 2004 and 2003, we continued to invest in our System
    Enhancement Strategy, an upgrade of all of MasterCard’s
    core systems to improve productivity and lower overall
    processing costs.

Other Income and Expense

Other income (expense) is comprised primarily of investment
income and interest expense. Investment income decreased
$8 million in 2004 and increased $31 million in 2003.
The decrease in 2004 resulted from a decline in the market value
of our trading securities portfolio. The increase in 2003 was
primarily due to the consolidation of the variable interest
entity (see the discussion in Note 12 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements herein) and appreciation of the market
value of our trading securities portfolio. Interest expense
increased $7 million and $53 million in 2004 and 2003,
respectively, primarily due to interest expense of
$51 million and $43 million, respectively, related to
imputed interest on the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement.
In addition, in 2003 the consolidation of the variable interest
entity increased interest expense.



Income Taxes

The effective income tax expense (benefit) rate for years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was 26.5%, (36.1)% and
26.5%, respectively. The decrease in the rate in 2004 was
primarily attributable to the settlement and reassessment of
various tax audit matters, the filing and recognition of refund
claims and a one-time increase in our deferred state tax assets
as a result of additional income subject to higher state and
local tax rates. The 2003 tax benefit was primarily driven by
the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement. The amount of the
litigation settlement and its impact on pretax income was so
large that the permanent differences did not significantly
affect the tax rate, resulting in a tax benefit at the highest
marginal rate. The increase in the rate from 2002 to 2003 was
primarily attributable to a one-time revaluation in 2002 of
MasterCard Europe’s deferred tax liabilities due to the
reduction in the Belgium statutory tax rate from 40.2% to 34.0%
in December 2002. The components impacting the effective tax
rate are:



Liquidity

We believe our ability to generate cash to reinvest in our
business is one of our fundamental financial strengths. We need
capital resources and liquidity to fund our global development,
to provide for credit and settlement risk, to finance capital
expenditures and any future acquisitions and to service the
payments of principal and interest on our outstanding debt and
the settlement of the U.S. merchant lawsuit. At
December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion of cash, cash
equivalents and available for sale securities with which to
manage operations, compared to $880 million at
December 31, 2003. We expect that the cash generated from
operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet
our operating, working capital and capital needs in 2005. In
addition, we believe that our resources are sufficient to fund
our initiatives to accelerate our profitable growth and to
enhance the global position of MasterCard in 2005. However, our
liquidity could be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of
the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. See
“Legal, Regulatory and Other Industry Risks.”

** — Not meaningful

Net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 and 2003 was
generated principally by current period earnings (losses)
exclusive of non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization
and legal settlements. The liabilities related to the
U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement and other legal
settlements discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements herein will be funded through existing cash
and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from
operations and our borrowing capacity. We recorded expense of
$22 million and $763 million for legal settlement
costs in 2004 and 2003, respectively, and had related cash
payments totaling $149 million and $134 million,
respectively.

The utilization of cash for investing activities in 2004 was
primarily due to purchases of available-for-sale securities and
the acquisition of certain businesses as described in
Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. In
2004 and 2003, we also invested in the internal development of
capitalized software and purchase of fixed assets to support our
business. Our capitalized software is essential to providing
payment card transaction processing to our customers through our
proprietary global computer and telecommunications system. Our
investing activities in 2003 included funding for a
co-processing facility in Kansas City, Missouri, and associated
equipment.

In addition to our liquid investments, we provide for liquidity
through a committed $1.95 billion revolving credit facility
(the “Credit Facility”) with certain financial
institutions which expires on June 17, 2005. The Credit
Facility replaced MasterCard Incorporated’s prior
$1.2 billion credit facility which expired on June 18,
2004. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are available to
provide liquidity in the event of one or more settlement
failures by MasterCard International members and, subject to a
limit of $300 million, for general corporate purposes.
Interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility is charged at
the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus
28 basis points. An additional 10 basis points would
be applied if the aggregate



borrowings under the Credit Facility exceed 33% of the
commitments. MasterCard agreed to pay a facility fee which
varies based on MasterCard’s credit rating and is currently
equal to 7 basis points on the total commitment. MasterCard
was in compliance with the Credit Facility covenants as of
December 31, 2004. There were no borrowings under the
Credit Facility at December 31, 2004. The majority of
Credit Facility lenders are members or affiliates of members of
MasterCard International.

Due to Standard & Poor’s assessment of
MasterCard’s vulnerability to legal risk, on May 16,
2003, Standard & Poor’s lowered MasterCard’s
counterparty credit rating to A-/A-2, subordinated debt rating
to BBB+ and placed MasterCard on negative outlook. These ratings
were reaffirmed in 2004. This rating has not materially impacted
our liquidity.

Legal, Regulatory and Other Industry Risks

Our business has many industry risks, most significantly the
legal and regulatory environment in which we operate. These
risks have increased in recent years, although we are
proactively seeking to address them. For a complete description
of the risks facing our business; see “Risk Factors”
in Item 1 — Business of this Report. The
following risks, among others, may have a material impact on our
results of operations or financial condition:

•

Legal and Regulatory Proceedings — MasterCard is a
    party to several legal and regulatory proceedings, as discussed
    in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein,
    which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Many
    of the legal and regulatory proceedings to which we are subject
    are supported by merchants, who have a growing role in the
    global payments industry. See “Merchant Acceptance
    Initiatives” in Item 1 — Business of this
    Report.

•

Competition and Consolidation of Our Customers — We
    are, and will continue to be, significantly dependent on our
    relationships with our issuers, acquirers and merchants. Most of
    our relationships with our customers are not exclusive and may
    be terminated at the convenience of our customers. In addition,
    the consolidation and globalization of our customers has
    provided more intense competition and greater demand for
    rebates, incentives and reduced pricing for our services. The
    consolidation or merger of one or more of our customers with
    financial institutions aligned with our competitors could have a
    material adverse impact on our revenues.

•

Economic — Our business is dependent on certain world
    economies and consumer behaviors. In the past, our revenues have
    been impacted by specific events such as the war in Iraq, the
    SARS outbreak and the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack.
    The tsunami in Asia did not impact our 2004 revenue; however we
    intend to closely monitor the impact as the recovery from the
    tsunami evolves in 2005.



Future Obligations

The following table summarizes as of December 31, 2004 our
obligations that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow
in future periods. We believe we will be able to fund these
obligations through cash generated from operations and our
existing cash balances.

Member Relationships and Related Parties

We have a diversified member base of approximately 2,200
principal members and approximately 21,500 affiliate members.
Our stockholders are principal members of MasterCard
International. In the normal course of business, we enter into
transactions with our members and operate a system for
authorizing, clearing and settling payment transactions among
the members of MasterCard International.

One customer, JP Morgan Chase Bank generated 12% of our
revenue in 2004. In addition, certain other customers generate
in excess of five percent of our revenue. The loss of any of
these members could adversely impact MasterCard’s net
income. In addition, as part of our business initiative to grow
our business, MasterCard, among other efforts, enters into
business agreements with members. These agreements can be
terminated in a variety of circumstances. Under certain
circumstances, we may be required to permit members in the
United States that have entered into agreements with us to
terminate those agreements without penalty as a result of the
antitrust litigation brought against us by the
U.S. Department of Justice. Any termination of these
agreements could have an adverse impact on our financial
condition. However, we believe



that it is not currently possible to estimate the impact, if
any, that the termination of any member business agreements
would have on our results of operations, financial position or
cash flows.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Our accounting policies are integral to understanding our
results of operations and financial condition. We are required
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements,
and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting periods. We have established detailed policies and
control procedures to ensure that the methods used to make
estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied
consistently from period to period. The following is a brief
description of our current accounting policies involving
significant management judgments.







Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 132 (revised 2003),
“Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other
Postretirement Benefits, an amendment of FASB Statements
No. 87, 88, and 106” (“SFAS 132”). This
Statement revises employers’ disclosures about pension
plans and other postretirement benefit plans. It does not change
the measurement or recognition of those plans required by
SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for
Pensions”, SFAS No. 88, “Employers’
Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit
Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits” and
SFAS No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions”. SFAS 132
requires additional disclosures about the assets, obligations,
cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit
pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. We have
fully implemented SFAS 132 for the year ended
December 31, 2004.

In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03-01, “The
Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application
to Certain Investments” (“EITF 03-01”).
EITF 03-01 provides guidance to determine whether an
other-than-temporary impairment exists for available-for-sale or
held-to-maturity investments under SFAS No. 115,
“Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Investments” and investments accounted for under the cost
method or the equity method. EITF 03-01 also requires
certain disclosures related to investments that are in an
unrealized loss position at the balance sheet date. The FASB has
indefinitely deferred the recognition and measurement guidance
in EITF 03-01, through FASB Staff Position
(“FSP”) No. EITF Issue 03-1-1. We have fully
implemented all of the required disclosures for the year ended
December 31, 2004.

In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 109-2
(“FSP 109-2”), “Accounting and Disclosure
Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within
the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004” (the
“Act”). FSP 109-2 provides enterprises more time
(beyond the financial-reporting period during which the Act took
effect) to evaluate the Act’s impact on the
enterprise’s plan for reinvestment or repatriation of
certain foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes”. We are not intending to
repatriate under the Act, therefore FSP 109-2 is not
expected to have an impact on our financial position or results
of operations.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk

Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred
on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse
changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign
currency exchange rates, and equity price risk. We have limited
exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign
exchange rates and equity price risk. Management establishes and
oversees the implementation of policies, which have been
approved by the board of directors, governing our funding,
investments, and use of derivative financial instruments. We
monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis. There have been no
material changes in our market risk exposures at
December 31, 2004 as compared to December 31, 2003.

Foreign Exchange Risk

We enter into forward exchange contracts to minimize risk
associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements
denominated in foreign currencies. We also enter into contracts
to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange
fluctuations of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies. The objective of this activity is to reduce our
exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from
fluctuations of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar
and euro. The terms of the forward currency contracts are
generally less than 18 months.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, forward currency contracts
against the U.S. dollar were both purchased (with notional
amounts of $41 million and $64 million, respectively)
and sold (with notional amounts of $20 million and
$60 million, respectively). Based on the year-end 2004 and
2003 foreign exchange positions, the effect of a hypothetical
10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar is
estimated to create a loss valued at $2.0 million and
$0.4 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.



At December 31, 2004 and 2003, forward currency contracts
against the euro were purchased (with notional amounts of
$128 million and $178 million, respectively). Based on
the year-end 2004 and 2003 foreign exchange positions, the
effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the
euro is estimated to create a loss valued at $11 million
and $16 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Our settlement activities are subject to foreign exchange risk
resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. This risk is
limited to the extent that the timeframe between setting the
foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions
is typically one business day and by limiting the supported
settlement currencies to the U.S. dollar or one of
seventeen other stable transaction currencies. The remaining 143
transaction currencies are settled in one of the supported
settlement currencies or require local settlement netting
arrangements that minimize our foreign exchange exposure.

Interest Rate Risk

Our interest rate sensitive assets are our debt instruments,
which we hold as available-for-sale investments. They are rated
AA or above and primarily consist of fixed rate short and
medium-term instruments. With respect to fixed maturities, our
general policy is to invest in high quality securities, while
providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to
avoid significant exposure. Based on the net present value of
expected future cash flows, a 100 basis point increase in
interest rates, assuming a parallel shift of the yield curve,
would result in fair value changes and an unrealized loss
recorded in other comprehensive income of $17 million for
each of 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our held-to-maturity
investments are not be subject to interest rate movements.

Our interest rate sensitive liabilities consist of subordinated
debt securities. A 100 basis point decrease in rates would
result in a fair value loss of $9 million and
$12 million for December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements herein.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had various credit
facilities to provide liquidity in the event of material member
settlement failures, settlement service operations and other
operational needs. These credit facilities have variable rates,
which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions
set forth in each agreement. There were no amounts outstanding
at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, under these
credit facilities. See Note 11 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements herein.

Equity Price Risk

We own trading securities, which are comprised of equity
securities selected to offset obligations in connection with an
executive compensation plan. The effect of a hypothetical
10 percent decline in market value would result in a loss
of $3 million in each of the years ended December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. To the extent the executive
compensation plan remains in a net appreciation position, an
offsetting gain would be recorded in general and administrative
expense.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING

The management of MasterCard Incorporated is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external reporting purposes in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. As required by Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management has assessed the
effectiveness of MasterCard’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. In making its
assessment management has utilized the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO) in its report entitled

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework.

Management has
concluded that, based on its assessment, MasterCard’s
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
December 31, 2004. Our management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of MasterCard’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 has been
audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears
on the next page.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of MasterCard Incorporated:

We have completed an integrated audit of MasterCard
Incorporated’s 2004 consolidated financial statements and
of its internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004 and audits of its December 31, 2003
and 2002 consolidated financial statements in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below.

Consolidated financial statements

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of MasterCard Incorporated and its
subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2004 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company changed its method for calculating the
market-related value of pension plan assets used in determining
the expected return on the assets component of annual pension
cost in 2003. Additionally, as discussed in Note 13 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company adopted the
provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No. 46R, “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities”, which resulted in the consolidation of
a special purpose entity in 2003.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting appearing in this Item, that the Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004 based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects,
based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on management’s
assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal



control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company consolidates majority-owned and controlled entities,
including specific consideration of variable interest entities
which are required to be consolidated in accordance with the
provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) Interpretation No. 46,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”
(“FIN 46”). Minority interest is recorded for
consolidated entities in which the Company owns less than 100%
of the interest. Minority interest represents the equity
interest not owned by the Company.

The Company accounts for investments in entities under the
equity method of accounting when it holds between 20% and 50%
ownership in the entity and when it exercises significant
influence. The equity method of accounting is also utilized for
limited partnerships and limited liability companies if the
investment ownership percentage is greater than 3% of
outstanding ownership interests or common stock, respectively,
regardless of whether MasterCard has significant influence over
the investees. MasterCard’s share of net earnings or losses
of entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting
is included in other income (expense), net on the consolidated
statements of operations.

The Company accounts for investments in affiliates under the
historical cost method of accounting when it holds less than 20%
ownership in the entity and when it does not exercise
significant influence.

Investments in entities for which the equity method and
historical cost method of accounting are appropriate are
recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

Use of estimates

— The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
periods. Management has established detailed policies and
control procedures to ensure the methods used to make estimates
are well controlled and applied consistently from period to
period. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Cash and cash equivalents

— Cash and cash
equivalents include certain highly liquid investments with a
maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase. Cash
equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.

Investment securities

— The Company classifies
debt securities as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale and
classifies equity securities as trading.

Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity when the
Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the debt
securities to maturity. Held-to-maturity debt securities are
stated at amortized cost. Debt securities that are not
held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale.
Available-for-sale debt securities



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share data)

are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses,
net of applicable taxes, recorded as a separate component of
other comprehensive income on the consolidated statements of
comprehensive income (loss). Quoted market values, when
available, are used to determine the fair value of debt
securities. The specific identification method is used to
determine gains and losses. Net realized gains and losses on
debt securities are recognized in investment income on the
consolidated statements of operations.

Equity securities bought and held primarily for sale in the near
term are classified as trading and are reported at fair value.
Quoted market values are used to determine the fair value of
trading securities. The Company’s trading securities are
publicly traded and are related to an executive compensation
plan. Net realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading
securities are recognized in investment income on the
consolidated statements of operations. The specific
identification method is used to determine realized gains and
losses. To the extent these securities appreciate over their
original cost, a corresponding offset would be recorded in
general and administrative expense in connection with the
executive compensation plan.

Held-to-maturity and available-for-sale investments are
evaluated for other than temporary impairment on an ongoing
basis in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 115, “Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities”.
Available-for-sale securities are available to meet the
Company’s current operational needs and accordingly are
classified as short-term.

Settlement due from/due to members

— The
Company operates systems for clearing and settling payment
transactions among MasterCard International members. Net
settlements are generally cleared daily among members through
settlement cash accounts by wire transfer or other bank clearing
means. However, some transactions may not settle until
subsequent business days, resulting in amounts due from and due
to MasterCard International members.

Restricted security deposits held for MasterCard
International members

— MasterCard requires and
holds cash deposits from certain members of MasterCard
International in order to maintain collateral for settlement of
their transactions. These assets are fully offset by
corresponding liabilities included on the consolidated balance
sheets.

Property, plant and equipment

— Property, plant
and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Depreciation of equipment and furniture and
fixtures is computed using the straight-line method over the
related estimated useful lives of the assets, generally ranging
from two to five years. Amortization of leasehold improvements
is computed using the straight-line method over the lesser of
the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the terms of
the related leases. Capital leases are amortized using the
straight-line method over the lives of the leases. Depreciation
on buildings is calculated using the straight-line method over
an estimated useful life of 30 years. Amortization of
leasehold improvements and capital leases is included in
depreciation expense.

The Company evaluates the recoverability of all long-lived
assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
their carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying
value of the asset cannot be recovered from estimated future
cash flows, undiscounted and without interest, the fair value of
the asset is calculated using the present value of estimated net
future cash flows. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds
its fair value, a loss is recorded.

Goodwill

— Goodwill represents the excess of
cost over net assets acquired in connection with the acquisition
of certain businesses. The Company tests its goodwill for
impairment at least annually. Goodwill was tested for impairment
during each of 2004, 2003 and 2002. In 2004, the company
recorded an impairment charge; see Note 6 herein.

Intangible assets

— Intangible assets consist
of capitalized software costs, franchise rights, trademarks,
tradenames and other intangible assets, which have finite lives,
and customer relationships, which have



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share data)

indefinite lives. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are
amortized over their estimated useful lives under the
straight-line method. MasterCard capitalizes average internal
costs incurred for payroll and payroll related expenses by
department for the employees who directly devote time to the
design, development and testing phases of each capitalized
software project.

The Company reviews intangible assets with finite lives for
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
their carrying amount may not be recoverable. During 2004, 2003
and 2002, the Company recorded impairment charges for finite
lived intangible assets; see Note 7 herein. Intangible
assets with indefinite lives, customer relationships, are tested
for impairment at least annually. No impairment charges were
recorded in 2004, 2003 or 2002.

Litigation accrual

— The Company is party to
certain legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a
variety of matters. Except as described in Notes 14 and 16,
MasterCard does not believe that any legal or regulatory
proceedings to which it is a party would have a material adverse
impact on its business or prospects. The Company evaluates the
likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of the legal or regulatory
proceedings to which it is a party in accordance with
SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”
(“SFAS No. 5”). These judgments are
subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory
proceedings, the merits of its defenses and consultation with
in-house and external legal counsel. The actual outcomes of
these proceedings may differ from the Company’s judgments.

Settlement and travelers cheque risk

—
MasterCard has global risk management policies and procedures,
which include risk standards to provide a framework for managing
the Company’s settlement exposure. Settlement risk is the
legal exposure due to the difference in timing between the
payment transaction date and subsequent settlement. MasterCard
International’s rules generally guarantee the payment of
MasterCard transactions and certain Cirrus and Maestro
transactions between principal members. In the event that
MasterCard International effects a payment on behalf of a failed
member, MasterCard International may seek an assignment of the
underlying receivables. Subject to approval by the Board of
Directors, members may be assessed for the amount of any
settlement loss. MasterCard has also guaranteed the payment of
MasterCard-branded travelers cheques in the event of issuer
default. The term and amount of these guarantees are unlimited.

Derivative financial instruments

— The Company
accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with
SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities”
(“SFAS 133”). SFAS 133, as amended and
interpreted, establishes accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities.
SFAS 133 requires that all derivatives, whether designated
in hedging relationships or not, be recorded on the balance
sheet at fair value in other assets and other liabilities,
regardless of the purpose or intent for holding them.

Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly
effective and that is designated and qualifies as a
foreign-currency cash flow hedge are recorded in other
comprehensive income (loss) until earnings are affected by the
variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction (e.g., until
periodic settlements of a variable-rate asset or liability are
recorded in earnings). Any hedge ineffectiveness (which
represents the amount by which the changes in the fair value of
the derivative exceeds the variability in the cash flows of the
forecasted transaction) is recorded in current-period earnings.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments which are
foreign currency fair value hedges or which do not qualify or
are not designated for hedge accounting under SFAS 133 are
reported in current-period earnings.

The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging
instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management
objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge
transactions for all derivatives that qualify for hedge
accounting under SFAS 133. This process includes linking
all derivatives



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share data)

that are designated as foreign-currency cash flow hedges to
forecasted transactions. The Company also formally assesses
(both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis)
whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions
have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair
value or cash flows of hedged items and whether those
derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future
periods. If and when it is determined that a derivative is no
longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is
discontinued.

Income taxes

— The Company provides for income
taxes under the provisions of SFAS No. 109
“Accounting for Income Taxes”
(“SFAS 109”). SFAS 109 requires an asset and
liability based approach in accounting for income taxes.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded to
reflect the tax consequences on future years of temporary
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and
income tax bases of assets and liabilities. Valuation allowances
are provided against assets which are not likely to be realized.

Revenue recognition

— The Company’s
revenue is comprised principally of operations fees and
assessments. Revenues are generated from the fees charged to
customers for providing transaction processing and other payment
services, and from assessments calculated on the dollar volume
of activity on cards carrying our brands. Revenues are generally
based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems
or reported by our customers. Certain revenues are estimated
based upon aggregate transaction information and historical and
projected customer performance. Revenues are recognized when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or
determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.

Operations fees represent fees for authorization, clearing,
settlement and other products and services that facilitate
transaction and information management among the Company’s
customers on a global basis. These fees are recognized as
revenue in the same period as the related transactions occur or
services are rendered. Other revenues included within operations
fees include currency conversion fees, net foreign exchange
gains or losses on settlement activities, excessive chargeback
violation fees, consulting, sales of holograms, warning
bulletins, manuals and publications.

Assessments predominantly represent payments made by members of
MasterCard International with respect to their card programs
carrying the marks of one or more of the brands within the
MasterCard family of brands, principally the MasterCard, Maestro
and Cirrus brands. Assessments are based principally upon daily,
monthly or quarterly gross dollar volumes (“GDV”),
which represent gross usage (purchase and cash disbursements) on
MasterCard-branded cards for goods and services, including
balance transfers and convenience checks. Assessments are
recorded as revenue in the period they are earned, which is when
the related GDV is generated on the cards. Assessments are based
on management’s estimate of the customers’ performance
in a given period and actual results may differ from these
estimates.

MasterCard has business agreements with certain customers that
provide for fee rebates when the customers meet certain hurdles.
Such rebates are calculated on a monthly basis based upon
estimated performance and the contracted discount rates for the
services provided. MasterCard also enters into agreements with
certain customers to provide volume-based and performance
support incentives. MasterCard may incur costs directly related
to the acquisition of the contract, which are deferred and
amortized over the life of the contract. Rebates and incentives
are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period as the
revenue is earned or performance has occurred, in accordance
with Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue
No. 01-9, “Accounting for Consideration Given by a
Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s
Products)” (“EITF 01-9”). Rebates and
incentives are based on management’s estimate of the
customers’ performance in a given period, and actual
results may differ from these estimates.



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share data)

In addition, certain rebate and incentive agreements provide for
free or discounted services, which are recorded in accordance
with EITF Issue No. 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with
Multiple Deliverables”. The discount from the fair value of
the services is recorded as a reduction of revenue related to
other elements of the contract using the residual method.

Pension and other postretirement plans

—
Compensation cost of an employee’s pension benefit is
recognized on the projected unit credit method over the
employee’s approximate service period. The unit credit cost
method is utilized for funding purposes. Prior to 2003, the
expected return on plan assets was based on a calculated asset
value. Beginning in 2003, the expected return on plan assets is
based on the current fair value of the plan assets; this change
in accounting principle is discussed in Note 9.

In December 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132
(revised 2003), “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions
and Other Postretirement Benefits, an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, and 106, and a revision of FASB
Statement No. 132” (“SFAS 132”). This
Statement revises employers’ disclosures about pension
plans and other postretirement benefit plans. It does not change
the measurement or recognition of those plans required by FASB
Statements No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for
Pensions”, No. 88, “Employers’ Accounting
for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension
Plans and for Termination Benefits”, and No. 106,
“Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions”. SFAS 132 requires additional
disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows, and net
periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other
postretirement benefit plans. The Company has fully implemented
SFAS 132 for the year ended December 31, 2004.

In May 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 106-2,
“Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of
2003 (the “Act”)” (“FSP 106-2”).
FSP 106-2 requires companies to account for the effect of
the subsidy on benefits attributable to past service as an
actuarial experience gain and as a reduction of the service cost
component of net postretirement health care costs for amounts
attributable to current service, if the benefit provided is at
least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. MasterCard
International determined the effects of the Act were not a
significant event requiring an interim remeasurement.
Consequently, as permitted by FSP 106-2, net periodic
postretirement benefit cost for 2004 does not reflect the
effects of the Act. The accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation (“APBO”) for the postretirement benefit
plan was remeasured at December 31, 2004 to reflect the
effects of the Act, which resulted in a reduction in the APBO of
$2,680.

Advertising expense

— Cost of media advertising
is expensed when the advertising takes place. Production costs
are expensed as costs are incurred. Promotional items are
expensed at the time the promotional event occurs.

Foreign currency translation

— The
U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the majority of
the Company’s businesses except for MasterCard
Europe’s operations, for which the functional currency is
the euro and MasterCard’s operations in Brazil for which
the functional currency is the real. Where the U.S. dollar
is considered the functional currency, monetary assets and
liabilities are remeasured to U.S. dollars using current
exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date; non-monetary
assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange
rates; and revenue and expense accounts are remeasured at a
weighted average exchange rate for the period. Resulting
exchange gains and losses are included in net income (loss).
Where local currency is the functional currency, translation
from the local currency to U.S. dollars is performed for
balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at
the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts
using a weighted average exchange rate for the period. Resulting
translation adjustments are reported as a component of other
comprehensive income (loss).



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share data)

Net income (loss) per share

— MasterCard
computes basic and diluted net income (loss) per share by
dividing net income (loss) applicable to common stock by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the
period.

Note 2.

Supplemental
Cash Flows

The following table includes supplemental cash flow disclosures
for the years ended December 31:

In January 2003, MasterCard purchased a building in Kansas City,
Missouri for approximately $23,572. The building is a
co-processing data center which replaced the back-up data center
in Lake Success, New York. During 2003, MasterCard entered into
agreements with the City of Kansas City for (i) the
sale-leaseback of the building and related equipment which
totaled $36,382 and (ii) the purchase of municipal bonds
for the same amount which have been classified as municipal
bonds held-to-maturity. The agreements enabled MasterCard to
secure state and local financial benefits. No gain or loss was
recorded in connection with the agreements. The leaseback has
been accounted for as a capital lease as the agreement contains
a bargain purchase option at the end of the ten-year lease term
on April 1, 2013. The building and related equipment are
being depreciated over their estimated economic life in
accordance with the Company’s policy. Rent of $1,819 is due
annually and is equal to the interest due on the municipal
bonds. The future minimum lease payments are $52,905 and are
included in the future commitment schedule in Note 13. A
portion of the building was subleased to the original building
owner for a five-year term with a renewal option. As of
December 31, 2004, the future minimum sublease rental
income is $2,868.

Note 6.

Goodwill

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years
ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 are as follows:

In February 2004, the Company acquired a research and advisory
firm focused exclusively on the global financial services
industry. In May 2004, the Company acquired a consulting firm
specializing in the optimization of customer relationships. The
Company identified for one of the acquisitions above, certain
indicators of potential impairment, including lower than
anticipated revenues during 2004 and loss of key customers which
would negatively impact future revenue growth. Accordingly, the
Company recorded impairment losses of $6,560 (goodwill of $5,454
and other intangible assets of $1,106), which are reflected
within general and administrative expenses on the consolidated
statements of operations herein.

Note 7.

Other Intangible
Assets

The following table sets forth net intangible assets, other than
goodwill:

Additions to capitalized software primarily relate to internal
projects associated with system enhancements or infrastructure
improvements adjusted for the translation of capitalized
software denominated in foreign currency. MasterCard’s
acquisitions during 2004 are discussed in Note 6 herein and
resulted in an increase in trademarks and tradenames in the
amount of $2,650 and an increase in other amortizable



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share data)

intangible assets, including covenants not to compete, customer
lists and a research library, in the amount of $7,548.

Amortizable trademarks and tradenames and unamortizable customer
relationships include assets which are denominated in foreign
currency. As such, a component of the net change in these
intangible assets is attributable to foreign currency
translation. In particular, customer relationships increased
$16,067 and trademarks increased $1,207 in 2004 for the portion
of these assets assumed in the acquisition of Europay
International S.A. on June 28, 2002, as discussed in
Note 18 herein.

Amortization and impairment expense on the assets above amounted

in connection with decisions to discontinue the use of various
technologies. The Company performed an impairment analysis on
the related technology and concluded that fair value was
estimated as zero due to discontinued future use of the
underlying technology. In addition, during 2004, the Company
identified and recorded impairment losses of $1,106 for one of
the acquisitions discussed in Note 6 herein. Impairment
charges are recorded in general and administrative expense on
the consolidated statements of operations for each of the years

Pension, Savings Plan and Other Benefits

The Company maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension
plan with a cash balance feature covering substantially all of
its U.S. employees. This pension plan credits participants
annually with an amount equal to a percentage of eligible pay
based on age and service, as well as providing earnings credits
based on



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share data)

each participant’s account balance. Additionally, the
Company has an unfunded nonqualified supplemental executive
retirement plan that provides certain key employees with
supplemental retirement benefits in excess of limits imposed on
qualified plans by U.S. tax laws.

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company changed its method
of calculating the market-related value of plan assets used in
determining the expected return on asset component of its annual
pension cost. Under the previous method, 80 percent of the
gains and losses on plan assets were deferred and recognized in
the calculated market-related value over the following four
years. Under the new method, the market-related value equals the
current fair value of the plan assets. The new method is
considered preferable because annual pension expense will
reflect changes in the market performance of plan assets on a
more timely basis.

The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle
related to periods prior to 2003 is a benefit to earnings for
the year ended December 31, 2003, in the amount of $7,768,
less income taxes of $2,819, for a net benefit of $4,949. The
Company’s net periodic pension cost would have been reduced
by $1,928 for 2003 if it had not changed its valuation method.
Applying the new methodology retroactively to January 1,
2002 would have had a negligible impact on net income and net
income per share for the year ended December 31, 2002.

On June 28, 2002, in connection with its acquisition of
MasterCard Europe, the Company assumed a defined benefit plan

affiliated with MasterCard Europe. On December 31, 2002,
the Company settled the benefit obligations and terminated the
European Plan. All excess assets are being transferred to a new
defined contribution plan.

The expected return on plan assets is primarily based on
long-term historical returns in equity and fixed income markets.
Based on estimated returns of 10 percent on equity
investments and 6 percent on fixed income investments and
the portfolio targeted asset allocation range, the weighted
average expected return of the qualified pension plan assets is
8.5 percent.

Plan assets are managed with a long-term perspective to ensure
that there is an adequate level of assets to support benefit
payments to participants over the life of the qualified plan.
The Company periodically conducts asset-liability studies to
establish the preferred target asset allocation. Plan assets are
managed within the asset allocation ranges above, toward targets
of 40% large cap U.S. equity, 15% small cap U.S. equity, 15%
non-U.S. equity and 30% fixed income, with periodic rebalancing
to maintain plan assets within the target asset allocation
ranges. Plan assets are managed by external investment managers.
Investment manager performance is measured against benchmarks
for each asset class and peer group on quarterly, one-, three-
and five-year periods. An independent consultant assists
management with investment manager selections and performance
evaluations. Approximately 8% of plan assets at
December 31, 2003 which are classified as fixed income are
invested in cash equivalents supporting obligations to purchase
fixed income securities at future dates. The other category
includes cash that is available to pay expected benefit payments
and expenses.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the funded status of the
qualified plan exceeded minimum funding requirements and the
Company was not required to make contributions. In December
2004, the Company elected to make a voluntary $15,000
contribution to its qualified pension plan. The Company expects
to make additional voluntary contributions totaling $25,000
before September 15, 2005.

The following table summarizes expected benefit payments through

The majority of the Company’s U.S. employees are eligible
to participate in a savings and profit sharing plan sponsored by
the Company. Effective January 1, 2003, the Company amended
its former savings plan to incorporate a new profit sharing
component. The new plan retains most of the characteristics of
the former plan. Similar to the former plan, the new plan allows
employees to contribute a portion of their base compensation on
a pre-tax and after-tax basis in accordance with specified
guidelines. The Company matches a percentage of the employee
contributions up to certain limits. Under the new plan, the
Company may also contribute a discretionary profit sharing
component linked to its performance each year. In addition, the
Company has several defined contribution plans outside of the
United States. The Company’s contribution expense related
to all of its savings plans was $35,517, $30,626 and $24,285 for
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The Company has a Value Appreciation Program (“VAP”),
which is a frozen incentive compensation plan established in
1995. Annual awards were granted to VAP participants from 1995
through 1998, which entitled participants to the net
appreciation on a portfolio of securities of MasterCard members.
In 1999, the VAP was replaced by an Executive Incentive Plan
(“EIP”). Although contributions to the VAP have been
discontinued, assets remain and participants are entitled to the
net appreciation on the portfolio of securities in accordance
with plan provisions. The Company’s liability related to
the VAP at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $10,274 and
$9,589 respectively, and the expense/(income) was $3,145, $8,497
and ($3,854) for the years ending December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively.

MasterCard EIP is a performance unit plan, in which participants
receive grants of units with a target value contingent on the
achievement of the Company’s long-term performance goals.
Employees who are designated Senior Vice President or higher are
eligible for participation in any performance period, provided
they have met certain performance criteria. The Compensation
Committee and/or the President and Chief Executive Officer may
also designate other employees as eligible to participate in the
plan.

The final value of the units under the EIP is calculated based
on the Company’s performance over a three-year period. The
performance units vest over three- and five-year periods. Awards
are paid in the form of cash over a five-year vesting period.
Upon completion of the three-year performance period,
participants receive a payment equal to 80 percent of the
award earned. The remaining 20 percent of the award is paid
upon completion of two additional years of service. The
Company’s liability related to EIP at December 31,
2004 and December 31, 2003 was $76,787 and $79,179
respectively, and the expense was $42,627, $27,764 and $36,545
for the years ending December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

Both the VAP and the EIP are accounted for in accordance with
FASB Interpretation No. 28, “Accounting for Stock
Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award
Plans” (“FIN 28”). In accordance with
FIN 28, compensation is accrued as a charge to expense over
the periods the employee performs the related services.

Postretirement Health and Life Insurance Benefits

The Company maintains a postretirement plan providing health
coverage and life insurance benefits for substantially all of
its U.S. employees and retirees.

In December 2003, the United States enacted into law the
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003
(the “Act”). The Act establishes a prescription drug
benefit under Medicare, known as “Medicare
Part D”, and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree
health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at
least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. The
Company believes that benefits provided to certain participants
will be at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D,
and, accordingly, the Company will be entitled to a subsidy.

In May 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
No. 106-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003” (“FSP 106-2”).
FSP 106-2 requires companies to account for the effects of
the federal subsidy on benefits attributable to past service as
an actuarial experience gain and as a reduction of the service
cost component of net postretirement health care costs for
amounts attributable to current service, if the benefit provided
is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D.

The Company determined the effects of the Act were not a
significant event requiring an interim remeasurement.
Consequently, as permitted by FSP 106-2, net periodic
postretirement benefit cost for 2004 does not reflect the
effects of the Act. The accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation (“APBO”) was remeasured at
December 31, 2004 to reflect the effects of the Act, which
resulted in a reduction in the APBO of $2,680.

Debt

On June 18, 2004, the Company entered into a committed
unsecured $1,950,000 revolving credit facility (the “Credit
Facility”) with certain financial institutions, which
expires on June 17, 2005. Borrowings under the Credit
Facility are available to provide liquidity in the event of one
or more settlement failures by MasterCard International members
and, subject to a limit of $300,000, for general corporate
purposes. The Credit Facility replaced MasterCard
Incorporated’s prior $1,200,000 credit facility, which
expired on June 18, 2004. Interest on borrowings under the
Credit Facility is charged at the London Interbank Offered Rate
plus 28 basis points. An additional 10 basis points would be
applied if the aggregate borrowings under the Credit Facility
were to exceed 33% of the commitments. MasterCard has agreed to
pay a facility fee in connection with the Credit Facility, which
varies based on MasterCard’s credit rating and is currently
equal to 7 basis points on the total commitment. The Company
also agreed to pay upfront fees of $906 and administrative fees
of $255 for the Credit Facility, which are being amortized
straight-line over one year. Facility and other fees associated
with the Credit Facility or prior facilities totaled $2,234,
$1,742 and $1,636 for each of the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. MasterCard was in compliance
with the Credit Facility covenants as of December 31, 2004
and was in compliance with the covenants for the previous
facility

(In thousands, except per share data)

at December 31, 2003. There were no borrowings under the
Credit Facility at December 31, 2004 or the previous
facility at December 31, 2003. The majority of the Credit
Facility lenders are members or affiliates of members of
MasterCard International.

On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the provisions of
FIN 46, as discussed in Note 12. As a result of the
consolidation of the variable interest entity, $149,380 in
long-term debt was recorded on the Company’s consolidated
balance sheet.

In June 1998, MasterCard International issued ten-year
unsecured, subordinated notes (the “Notes”) paying a
fixed interest rate of 6.67% per annum. The terms of the Notes
require MasterCard to repay the principal amount on
June 30, 2008. The Company has the option to prepay the
principal amount of the Notes at anytime prior to the repayment
date, however an additional “make-whole” amount must
also be calculated and paid to investors at that time. The
“make whole” amount represents the discounted value of
the remaining principal and interest. The interest on the Notes
was $5,336 for each of the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002. During 2004, MasterCard Incorporated amended
certain covenant compliance obligations. The amendment aligns
MasterCard’s financial reporting and net worth covenant
obligations with similar obligations under its other debt
instruments. MasterCard entered into the amendment to better
reflect MasterCard’s corporate structure and to reduce the
costs and administrative burden of complying with different debt
covenants. The Company was in compliance with the covenants of
the Notes as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. The principal
amount of the Notes outstanding at December 31, 2004 and
2003 was $80,000. The fair value of the Notes was estimated at
$86,006 and $88,440 at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

During 2004, MasterCard Europe and European Payment System
Services sprl, a subsidiary of MasterCard, reduced their
multi-purpose uncommitted credit facility with a bank from
35,000 euros to a 1,000 euro overdraft facility for
MasterCard Europe and European Payment System Services sprl and
a 1,000 euro guarantee facility for MasterCard Europe.
There were no material borrowings under these facilities at
December 31, 2004; however at December 31, 2004 and
2003, the facility supported bank-issued guarantees for a total
of 692 euros and 742 euros, respectively, which
reduced the amount of funds available under the facility. For
these bank guarantees, a guarantee fee is paid at a rate of 1.5%
per annum.

MasterCard Europe has one additional uncommitted credit
agreement totaling 100,000 euros. There were no borrowings
under this agreement at December 31, 2004 and 2003.
MasterCard Europe canceled an uncommitted credit agreement
totaling 30,000 euros during 2004.

Note 12.

Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entity

On August 31, 1999, MasterCard International entered into a
ten-year synthetic lease agreement for a global technology and
operations center located in O’Fallon, Missouri, called
Winghaven. The lessor under the lease agreement is MasterCard
International O’Fallon 1999 Trust (the “Trust”).
The Trust, which is a variable interest entity was established
for a single discrete purpose, is not an operating entity, has a
limited life and has no employees. The Trust financed the
operations center through a combination of a third party equity
investment and the issuance of 7.36 percent Series A
Senior Secured Notes (the “Secured Notes”) in the
amount of $149,380 due September 1, 2009.

Annual rent of $11,390 is payable by MasterCard International
and is equal to interest payments on the Secured Notes and a
return to equity-holders. The future minimum lease payments are
$53,155 and are included in the future commitment schedule in
Note 13. In conjunction with the lease agreement,
MasterCard International executed a guarantee of
85.15 percent of the Secured Notes outstanding totaling
$127,197. Additionally, upon the occurrence of specific events
of default, MasterCard International guarantees repayment of the
total outstanding principal and interest on the Secured Notes
and would take ownership of

the facility. During 2004, MasterCard Incorporated became party
to the guarantee and assumed certain covenant compliance
obligations, including financial reporting and maintenance of
consolidated net worth. The amendment to the guarantee aligns
the Company’s financial reporting and net worth covenant
obligations under the guarantee with similar obligations under
its other debt instruments. The Company entered into the
amendment to the guarantee to better reflect the Company’s
corporate structure and to reduce the costs and administrative
burden of complying with different debt covenants.

The lease agreement permits MasterCard International to purchase
the facility upon 180 days notice at a purchase price equal
to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Secured
Notes, including any accrued and unpaid interest and investor
equity, along with any accrued and unpaid amounts due to the
investor under the lease agreement after August 31, 2006.

On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the provisions of
FIN 46 and consolidated the Trust on the Company’s
consolidated balance sheets, which resulted in recording
$154,000 in municipal bonds held by the Trust, $149,380 in
long-term debt and $4,620 of minority interest relating to the
equity in the Trust held by a third party. The redemption value
of the minority interest approximates its carrying value and
will be redeemed by the minority interest holders upon the
maturity of the Secured Notes. For the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003, the consolidation had no impact
on net income (loss). However, interest income and interest
expense were each increased by $11,390 in each of the years
ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.

MasterCard licenses certain software to its customers. The
license agreements contain guarantees under which the Company
indemnifies licensees from any adverse judgments arising from
claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties.
The terms of the guarantees are equal to the terms of the
license to which they relate. The amount of the guarantees are
limited to damages, losses, costs, expenses or other

U.S. Merchant
Lawsuit and Other Legal Settlements

During 2003, MasterCard settled the U.S. merchant lawsuit
described in Note 16 herein and contract disputes with
certain customers. MasterCard International signed a Memorandum
of Understanding (“MOU”) with plaintiffs in the U.S.
merchant lawsuit on April 30, 2003. On June 4, 2003,
MasterCard International and plaintiffs signed a settlement
agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) embodying the
terms originally set forth in the MOU. The Settlement Agreement
required the Company to pay $125,000 in 2003 and pay $100,000
annually in December from 2004 through 2012. In addition, the
Company adopted rules which permit U.S. merchants to elect not
to accept MasterCard branded debit (or credit) cards,
implemented programs to allow merchants to identify debit cards,
provided signage to merchants and established a separate debit
interchange rate for a required period. For a description of
interchange, see the text under the heading “Global
Interchange Proceedings” in Note 16 herein.

In connection with the signing of the MOU, MasterCard recorded a
pre-tax charge of $721,000 ($469,000 after-tax) in the three
months ended March 31, 2003, consisting of (i) the
monetary amount of the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement
(discounted at 8 percent over the payment term),
(ii) certain additional costs in connection with, and in
order to comply with, other requirements of the U.S. merchant
lawsuit settlement, and (iii) costs to address the
merchants who opted not to participate in the plaintiff class in
the U.S. merchant lawsuit. As noted above and described further
in Note 16 herein, several lawsuits were initiated by
merchants who opted not to participate in the plaintiff class in
the U.S. merchant lawsuit. The “opt-out” merchant
lawsuits are not covered by the terms of the Settlement
Agreement. The $721,000 pre-tax charge amount was an estimate,
which was subsequently revised based on the approval of the
Settlement Agreement by the court, and other factors. If
necessary, future refinements will also be made.

In addition, during 2003 and 2004 certain other legal matters
were settled or resolved with MasterCard’s customers and
employees. Accruals for these matters are included in other
legal settlements.

Total liabilities for the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal
settlements changed as follows:

earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004
because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely
outside of the United States. If these earnings were
distributed, foreign tax credits may become available under
current law to reduce the resulting U.S. income tax liability.

The provision (benefit) for income taxes differs from the amount
of income tax (benefit) determined by applying the appropriate
statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to pretax income (loss)
for the years ended December 31, as a result of the
following:

The effective income tax (benefit) rate for the year ended
December 31, 2004 was 26.5% versus an effective income tax
(benefit) rate of (36.1)% for the year ended December 31,
2003. The lower 2004 rate was primarily attributable to the
settlement and reassessment of various tax audit matters, the
filing and recognition of refund claims and a one-time increase
in our deferred state tax assets as a result of additional
income subject to higher state and local tax rates.

Legal
Proceedings

MasterCard is a party to legal proceedings with respect to a
variety of matters in the ordinary course of business. Except as
described below, MasterCard does not believe that any legal
proceedings to which it is a party would have a material impact
on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Department of Justice Antitrust Litigation and Related
Private Litigation

In October 1998, the United States Department of Justice
(“DOJ”) filed suit against MasterCard International,
Visa U.S.A., Inc. and Visa International Corp. in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging
that both MasterCard’s and Visa’s governance structure
and policies violated U.S. federal antitrust laws. First, the
DOJ claimed that “dual governance” — the
situation where a financial institution has a representative on
the board of directors of MasterCard or Visa while a portion of
its card portfolio is issued under the brand of the other
association — was anti-competitive and acted to limit
innovation within the payment card industry. At the same time,
the DOJ conceded that “dual issuance” — a
term describing the structure of the bank card industry in the
United States in which a single financial institution can issue
both MasterCard and Visa-branded cards — was
pro-competitive. Second, the DOJ challenged MasterCard’s
Competitive Programs Policy (“CPP”) and a Visa bylaw
provision that prohibit financial institutions participating in
the respective associations from issuing competing proprietary
payment cards (such as American Express or Discover). The DOJ
alleged that MasterCard’s CPP and Visa’s bylaw
provision acted to restrain competition.

A bench trial concerning the DOJ’s allegations was
concluded on August 22, 2000. On October 9, 2001, the
District Court judge issued an opinion upholding the legality
and pro-competitive nature of dual governance. In so doing, the
judge specifically found that MasterCard and Visa have competed
vigorously over the years, that prices to consumers have dropped
dramatically, and that MasterCard has fostered rapid innovations
in systems, product offerings and services.

However, the judge also held that MasterCard’s CPP and the
Visa bylaw constitute unlawful restraints of trade under the
federal antitrust laws. The judge found that the CPP and Visa
bylaw weakened competition and harmed consumers by preventing
competing proprietary payment card networks such as American
Express and Discover from entering into agreements with banks to
issue cards on their networks. In reaching this decision, the
judge found that two distinct markets — a credit and
charge card issuing market and a network services
market — existed in the United States, and that both
MasterCard and Visa had market power in the network market.
MasterCard strongly disputes these findings and believes that
the DOJ failed, among other things, to demonstrate that U.S.
consumers have been harmed by the CPP.

On November 26, 2001, the judge issued a final judgment
that ordered MasterCard to repeal the CPP insofar as it applies
to issuers and enjoined MasterCard from enacting or enforcing
any bylaw, rule, policy or practice that prohibits its issuers
from issuing general purpose credit or debit cards in the United
States on any other general purpose card network. The judge also
concluded that during the period in which the CPP was in effect,
MasterCard was able to “lock up” certain members by
entering into long-term agreements with them pursuant to which
the members committed to maintain a certain percentage of their
general purpose card volume, new card issuance or total number
of cards in force in the United States on MasterCard’s
network. Accordingly, the final judgment provided that there
will be a period (commencing on the effective date of the
judgment and ending on the later of two years from that date or
two years from the resolution of any final appeal) during which
MasterCard will be required to permit any issuer with which it
entered into such an agreement prior to the effective date of
the final judgment to terminate that agreement without penalty,
provided that the reason for the termination is to permit the
issuer to enter into an agreement with American Express or
Discover. MasterCard would be free to apply to the District
Court to recover funds paid but not yet earned under any
terminated agreement. The final judgment imposed parallel
requirements on Visa. The judge explicitly provided that
MasterCard and Visa would be free to enter into new partnership
or member business agreements in the future.

MasterCard appealed the judge’s ruling with respect to the
CPP. On September 17, 2003 a three-judge panel of the
Second Circuit issued its decision upholding the District
Court’s decision. On October 4, 2004, the Supreme
Court denied MasterCard’s petition for certiorari, thereby
exhausting all avenues for further appeal in this case.
Thereafter, the parties agreed that October 15, 2004 would
serve as the effective date of the final judgment.

In addition, on September 18, 2003, MasterCard filed a
motion before the District Court judge in this case seeking to
enjoin Visa, pending completion of the appellate process, from
enforcing a newly-enacted bylaw requiring Visa’s 100
largest issuers of debit cards in the United States to pay a
so-called “settlement service” fee if they reduce
their Visa debit volume by more than 10%. This bylaw was later
modified to clarify that the settlement service fee would only
be imposed if an issuer shifted its portfolio of debit cards to
MasterCard. Visa implemented this bylaw provision following the
settlement of the U.S. merchant lawsuit described under the
heading “U.S. Merchant Opt Out and Consumer
Litigations” below. MasterCard believes that this bylaw is
punitive and inconsistent with the final judgment in the DOJ
litigation. On December 8, 2003, the District Court judge
ruled that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to issue an
injunction, but held that the court would have the authority to
rescind contracts entered into by issuers with Visa during the
time that the settlement service fee was in effect if the
court’s final judgment was upheld on appeal and the court
finds that the settlement service fee violates the final
judgment. As a result of the Supreme Court’s denial of



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share data)

certiorari, the District Court now has jurisdiction over issues
related to the final judgment in the DOJ litigation. On
January 10, 2005, MasterCard moved before the District
Court to enforce the terms of the final judgment and sought an
order enjoining Visa from enforcing or maintaining its
settlement service fee bylaw. In addition, MasterCard requested
that the Court permit Visa’s largest 100 debit issuers to
rescind any debit issuance agreements they entered into with
Visa while the settlement service fee was in effect. The motion
is scheduled to be fully briefed on May 6, 2005. At this
time it is not possible to determine the ultimate resolution of
this matter.

On October 4, 2004, Discover Financial Services, Inc. filed
a complaint against MasterCard, Visa U.S.A., Inc. and Visa
International Incorporated. The complaint was filed in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York and was
designated as a related case to the DOJ litigation, and
preliminarily assigned to the same judge. The complaint alleges
that the implementation and enforcement of MasterCard’s CPP
and Visa’s bylaw provision as well as MasterCard’s
“Honor All Cards” rule (and a similar Visa rule),
which require merchants who accept MasterCard cards to accept
for payment every validly presented MasterCard card, violated
Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act as well as
California’s Unfair Competition Act. The complaint also
challenged MasterCard’s “no surcharge rule” (and
a similar Visa rule) under the same statutes. On
December 10, 2004, MasterCard moved to dismiss the
complaint in its entirety for failure to state a claim. In lieu
of filing its opposition papers to MasterCard’s motion,
Discover filed an amended complaint on January 7, 2005. In
the amended complaint, Discover dropped some of its claims,
including its challenge against the no surcharge rule and it
claims under California’s Unfair Competition Act, but
continues to allege that the implementation and enforcement of
the Company’s CPP, Visa’s bylaw provision and the
Honor All Cards rules are in violation of Sections 1 and 2
of the Sherman Act. Discover requests that the District Court
apply collateral estoppel with respect to its final judgment in
the DOJ litigation and enter an order that CPP and Visa’s
bylaw provision have injured competition and caused injury to
Discover. Discover seeks treble damages in an amount to be
proved at trial along with attorneys’ fees and costs. On
February 7, 2005, MasterCard moved to dismiss
Discover’s amended complaint in its entirety for failure to
state a claim. Oral argument is scheduled for April 1,
2005. At this time it is not possible to determine the ultimate
resolution of this matter. No provision for losses has been
provided in connection with the Discover litigation.

On November 15, 2004, American Express filed a complaint
against MasterCard, Visa and eight member banks, including J.P.
Morgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Capital One
Financial Corp., U.S. Bancorp, Household International Inc.,
Wells Fargo & Co., Providian Financial Corp. and USAA
Federal Savings Bank. The complaint, which was filed in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York, was
designated as a related case to the DOJ litigation and was
assigned to the same judge. The complaint alleges that the
implementation and enforcement of MasterCard’s CPP and
Visa’s bylaw provision violated Sections 1 and 2 of
the Sherman Act. American Express seeks treble damages in an
amount to be proved at trial, along with attorneys’ fees
and costs. On January 14, 2005, MasterCard filed a motion
to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. American
Express’ time in which to oppose MasterCard’s motion
is currently running. Oral argument on the motion is scheduled
for April 1, 2005. At this time it is not possible to
determine the ultimate resolution of this matter. No provision
for losses has been provided in connection with the American
Express litigation.

Currency Conversion Litigations

MasterCard International, together with Visa U.S.A., Inc. and
Visa International Corp., are defendants in a state court
lawsuit in California. The lawsuit alleges that MasterCard and
Visa wrongfully imposed an asserted one percent currency
conversion “fee” on every credit card transaction by
U.S. MasterCard and Visa cardholders involving the purchase of
goods or services in a foreign country, and that such alleged
“fee” is unlawful. This action, titled
Schwartz v. Visa Int’l Corp., et al., was brought in
the Superior Court of California in February 2000, purportedly
on behalf of the general public. Trial of the Schwartz matter



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share data)

commenced on May 20, 2002 and concluded on
November 27, 2002. The Schwartz action claims that the
alleged “fee” grossly exceeds any costs the defendants
might incur in connection with currency conversions relating to
credit card purchase transactions made in foreign countries and
is not properly disclosed to cardholders. MasterCard denies
these allegations

.

On April 8, 2003, the trial court judge issued a final
decision in the Schwartz matter. In his decision, the trial
judge found that MasterCard’s currency conversion process
does not violate the Truth in Lending Act or regulations, nor is
it unconscionably priced under California law. However, the
judge found that the practice is deceptive under California law,
and ordered that MasterCard mandate that members disclose the
currency conversion process to cardholders in cardholder
agreements, applications, solicitations and monthly billing
statements. As to MasterCard, the judge also ordered restitution
to California cardholders. The judge issued a decision on
restitution on September 19, 2003, which requires a
traditional notice and claims process in which consumers have
approximately six months to submit their claims. The court
issued its final judgment on October 31, 2003. On
December 29, 2003, MasterCard appealed the judgment. The
final judgment and restitution process have been stayed pending
MasterCard’s appeal. On August 6, 2004 the court
awarded plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees in the amount of
$28,224 to be paid equally by MasterCard and Visa. Accordingly,
during the three months ended September 30, 2004,
MasterCard accrued amounts totaling $14,112 which are included
in U.S. Merchant Lawsuit and Other Legal Settlements in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations (see Note 14).
MasterCard subsequently filed a notice of appeal on the
attorneys’ fee award on October 1, 2004. With respect
to restitution, MasterCard believes that it is likely to prevail
on appeal. At this time it is not possible to determine the
ultimate resolution of this matter. Other than as set forth
above, no provision for losses has been provided in connection
with this matter.

In addition, MasterCard has been served with complaints in state
courts in New York, Arizona, Texas, Florida, Arkansas, Illinois,
Tennessee, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Minnesota and Missouri
seeking to, in effect, extend the judge’s decision in the
Schwartz matter to MasterCard cardholders outside of California.
Some of these cases have been transferred to the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York and combined with
the federal complaints in MDL No. 1409 discussed below. In
other state court cases, MasterCard has moved to dismiss the
claims. On July 28, 2004, a New York state action was
dismissed without prejudice. On February 1, 2005 a Michigan
action was dismissed with prejudice. MasterCard has also been
served with complaints in state courts in California and Texas
alleging it wrongfully imposed an asserted one percent currency
conversion “fee” in every debit card transaction by
U.S. MasterCard cardholders involving the purchase of goods or
services in a foreign country and that such alleged
“fee” is unlawful. Visa USA, Inc. and Visa
International Corp. have been named as co-defendants in the
California cases. One such Texas case was dismissed voluntarily
by plaintiffs, however a new complaint is expected to be filed.
At this time, it is not possible to determine the ultimate
resolution of these matters and no provision for losses has been
provided in connection with them.

MasterCard International, Visa U.S.A., Inc., Visa International
Corp., several member banks including Citibank (South Dakota),
N.A., Citibank (Nevada), N.A., Chase Manhattan Bank USA, N.A.,
Bank of America, N.A. (USA), MBNA, and Diners Club are also
defendants in a number of federal putative class actions that
allege, among other things, violations of federal antitrust laws
based on the asserted one percent currency conversion
“fee”. Pursuant to an order of the Judicial Panel on
Multidistrict Litigation, the federal complaints have been
consolidated in MDL No. 1409 before Judge William H. Pauley
III in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
York. In January 2002, the federal plaintiffs filed a
Consolidated Amended Complaint (“MDL Complaint”)
adding MBNA Corporation and MBNA America Bank, N.A. as
defendants. This pleading asserts two theories of antitrust
conspiracy under Section 1 of the Sherman Act: (i) an
alleged “inter-association” conspiracy among
MasterCard (together with its members), Visa (together with its
members) and Diners Club to fix currency conversion
“fees” allegedly charged to cardholders of “no
less than 1% of the transaction amount and frequently
more;” and (ii) two alleged
“intra-association”



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share data)

conspiracies, whereby each of Visa and MasterCard is claimed
separately to have conspired with its members to fix currency
conversion “fees” allegedly charged to cardholders of
“no less than 1% of the transaction amount” and
“to facilitate and encourage institution — and
collection — of second tier currency conversion
surcharges.” The MDL Complaint also asserts that the
alleged currency conversion “fees” have not been
disclosed as required by the Truth in Lending Act and
Regulation Z.

Defendants have moved to dismiss the MDL Complaint. On
July 3, 2003, Judge Pauley issued a decision granting
MasterCard’s motion to dismiss in part. Judge Pauley
dismissed the Truth in Lending claims in their entirety as
against MasterCard, Visa and several of the member bank
defendants. Judge Pauley did not dismiss the antitrust claims.
Fact discovery in this matter has closed but expert discovery is
ongoing. On November 12, 2003 plaintiffs filed a motion for
class certification, which was granted on October 15, 2004.
A trial date has been set for October 10, 2005. At this
time, it is not possible to determine the ultimate resolution of
this matter and no provision for losses has been provided in
connection with it.

Merchant Chargeback-Related Litigations

On May 12, 2003, a complaint alleging violations of federal
and state antitrust laws, breach of contract, fraud and other
theories was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central
District of California (Los Angeles) against MasterCard by a
merchant aggregator whose customers include businesses selling
adult entertainment content over the Internet. The
complaint’s allegations focus on MasterCard’s past and
potential future assessments on the plaintiff’s merchant
bank (acquirer) for exceeding excessive chargeback standards in
connection with the plaintiff’s transaction activity as
well as the effect of MasterCard’s chargeback rules and
other practices on “card-not-present” merchants.
Chargebacks refer to a situation where a transaction is
returned, or charged back, to an acquirer by an issuer at the
request of cardholders or for other reasons. Prior to MasterCard
filing any motion or responsive pleading, the plaintiff filed a
voluntary notice of dismissal without prejudice on
December 5, 2003. On the same date, the plaintiff filed a
complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
New York making similar allegations to those made in its initial
California complaint. MasterCard moved to dismiss all of the
claims in the complaint for failure to state a cause of action.
The Court has yet to schedule oral argument on the motion.

In addition, on June 6, 2003, an action titled California
Law Institute v. Visa U.S.A., et al. was initiated against
MasterCard and Visa U.S.A., Inc. in the Superior Court of
California, purportedly on behalf of the general public.
Plaintiffs seek disgorgement, restitution and injunctive relief
for unlawful and unfair business practices in violation of
California Unfair Trade Practices Act Section 17200, et.
seq. Plaintiffs purportedly allege that MasterCard’s (and
Visa’s) chargeback fees are unfair and punitive in nature.
Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief preventing MasterCard from
continuing to engage in its chargeback practices and requiring
MasterCard to provide restitution and/or disgorgement for monies
improperly obtained by virtue of them. On November 19,
2004, MasterCard moved for judgment on the grounds that recent
amendments to sections 17203 and 17204 of the California
Business and Professions Code by the California State Ballot
Initiative Proposition 64 mandate that the California Law
Institute, as an unaffected plaintiff, does not have standing to
pursue this action. By order dated December 29, 2004, the
Court denied the motion but certified the question presented as
appropriate for appellate resolution. On February 3, 2005,
the Appellate Division denied MasterCard’s petition for
appellate review. On February 11, 2005, MasterCard
petitioned the California Supreme Court for a review of the
Appellate Division’s denial of MasterCard’s petition
for appellate review. The California Supreme Court has not yet
ruled on MasterCard’s petition. Initial, but limited,
discovery is now proceeding in this matter.

On September 20, 2004, MasterCard was served with a
complaint titled PSW Inc. v. Visa U.S.A, Inc, MasterCard
International Incorporated, et. al., No. 04-347, in the
District Court of Rhode Island. The plaintiff, as alleged in the
complaint, provided credit card billing services primarily for
adult content web sites.



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

(In thousands, except per share data)

The plaintiff alleges defendants’ excessive chargeback
standards, exclusionary rules, merchant registration programs,
cross-border acquiring rules and interchange pricing to internet
merchants violate federal and state antitrust laws as well as
state contract and tort law. The plaintiff seeks $60,000 in
compensatory damages as well as $180,000 in punitive damages. On
November 24, 2004, MasterCard moved to dismiss the
complaint. Plaintiff’s opposition brief was filed on
January 28, 2005 and MasterCard’s reply was filed on
February 9, 2005.

At this time it is not possible to determine the outcome of the
merchant chargeback-related litigations. No provision for losses
has been provided in connection with these litigations.

U.S. Merchant Opt Out and Consumer Litigations

Commencing in October 1996, several class action suits were
brought by a number of U.S. merchants against MasterCard
International and Visa U.S.A., Inc. challenging certain aspects
of the payment card industry under U.S. federal antitrust law.
Those suits were later consolidated in the U.S. District Court
for the Eastern District of New York. The plaintiffs challenged
MasterCard’s “Honor All Cards” rule and a similar
Visa rule. Plaintiffs claimed that MasterCard and Visa
unlawfully tied acceptance of debit cards to acceptance of
credit cards. The plaintiffs also claimed that MasterCard and
Visa conspired to monopolize what they characterized as the
point-of-sale debit card market, thereby suppressing the growth
of regional networks such as ATM payment systems. On
June 4, 2003, MasterCard International signed the
Settlement Agreement to settle the claims brought by the
plaintiffs in this matter, which the Court approved on
December 19, 2003. A number of class members have appealed
the District Court’s approval of the settlement. These
appeals are largely focused on the court’s attorneys’
fees award as well on the court’s ruling on the scope of
the release set forth in the Settlement Agreement. On
January 4, 2005, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals issued
an order affirming the District Court’s approval of the
U.S. merchant settlement agreement. Plaintiffs’ time in
which to seek certiorari of the Second Circuit’s decision
with the U.S. Supreme Court is currently running. For a further
description of the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement and its
impact on MasterCard’s financial results, see Note 14.

Several lawsuits were commenced by merchants who have opted not
to participate in the plaintiff class in the U.S. merchant
lawsuit, including Best Buy Stores, CVS, Giant Eagle, Home
Depot, Toys “R” Us and Darden Restaurants
(collectively, the “Opt Out Plaintiffs”). The majority
of these cases were filed in the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of New York. MasterCard has entered into
separate settlement agreements with each of the Opt Out
Plaintiffs resolving their claims against MasterCard. The
District Court has entered orders dismissing with prejudice each
of the Opt Out Plaintiff’s complaints against MasterCard.
For a description of the impact of the settlements with the Opt
Out Plaintiffs on MasterCard’s financial results, see
Note 14.

In addition, individual or multiple complaints have been brought
in 19 different states and the District of Columbia under
state unfair competition statutes against MasterCard
International (and Visa) on behalf of putative classes of
consumers. The claims in these actions mirror the allegations
made in the U.S. merchant lawsuit and assert that merchants,
faced with excessive merchant discount fees, have passed these
overcharges to consumers in the form of higher prices on goods
and services sold. While these actions are in their early
stages, MasterCard has filed motions to dismiss the complaints
in a number of state courts for failure to state a cause of
action. Courts in Arizona, Iowa, New York, Michigan, Minnesota,
Nebraska, Maine, North Dakota, Kansas, North Carolina, South
Dakota, Vermont and Wisconsin have granted MasterCard’s
motions and dismissed the complaints with prejudice. The
plaintiffs in the New York, Maine, Michigan, Kansas, Iowa, North
Carolina, North Dakota and South Dakota cases have filed a
notice of appeal, and the time in which the plaintiffs in the
other states may appeal is currently running. The plaintiffs in
Kansas, Maine, Vermont, North Carolina, Michigan, North Dakota
and South Dakota have filed stipulations of dismissal
withdrawing their appeals. The plaintiffs in Maine have moved to
withdraw their appeal. Oral argument on the New York

appeal is currently scheduled for March 1, 2005. The
plaintiffs in Minnesota have filed a revised complaint on behalf
of a purported class of Minnesota consumers who made purchases
with debit cards rather than on behalf of all consumers. On
January 6, 2005, MasterCard moved to dismiss the Minnesota
complaint for failure to state a claim. Plaintiffs’ time in
which to oppose the motion in the Minnesota complaint is
currently running. In addition, the courts in Tennessee and
California have granted MasterCard’s motion to dismiss the
respective state unfair competition claims but have denied
MasterCard’s motions with respect to unjust enrichment
claims in Tennessee and Section 17200 claims for unlawful,
unfair, and/or fraudulent business practices in California. On
February 2, 2005 the court granted MasterCard permission to
appeal the trial court’s decision in Tennessee on the
unjust enrichment claims. On that same date, the court granted
plaintiff’s motion to appeal the court’s dismissal of
the state unfair competition claims. The time in which to file
an application to the appellate court for permission to appeal
is currently running. MasterCard is awaiting decisions on its
motions to dismiss in the other state courts. At this time, it
is not possible to determine the outcome of these consumer cases
and no provision for losses has been provided in connection with
them. The consumer class actions are not covered by the terms of
the Settlement Agreement in the U.S. merchant lawsuit.

Global Interchange Proceedings

Interchange fees represent a sharing of payment system costs
among the financial institutions participating in a four-party
payment card system such as MasterCard’s. Typically,
interchange fees are paid by the merchant bank (the
“acquirer”) to the cardholder bank (the
“issuer”) in connection with transactions initiated
with the payment system’s cards. These fees reimburse the
issuer for a portion of the costs incurred by it in providing
services which are of benefit to all participants in the system,
including acquirers and merchants. MasterCard establishes a
multilateral interchange fee (“MIF”) in certain
circumstances as a default fee that applies when there is no
other interchange fee arrangement between the issuer and the
acquirer. MasterCard establishes a variety of MIF rates
depending on such considerations as the location and the type of
transaction, and collects the MIF on behalf of the institutions
entitled to receive it. As described more fully below, MIFs are
subject to regulatory or legal review and/or challenges in a
number of jurisdictions. At this time, it is not possible to
determine the ultimate resolution of any of the interchange
proceedings described below. Accordingly, no provision for
losses has been provided in connection with them.

European Union.

In September 2000, the European
Commission issued a “Statement of Objections”
challenging Visa International’s cross-border MIF under
European Community competition rules. On July 24, 2002, the
European Commission announced its decision to exempt the Visa
MIF from these rules based on certain changes proposed by Visa
to its MIF. Among other things, in connection with the exemption
order, Visa agreed to adopt a cost-based methodology for
calculating its MIF similar to the methodology employed by
MasterCard, which considers the costs of certain specified
services provided by issuers, and to reduce its MIF rates for
debit and credit transactions to amounts at or below certain
specified levels.

On September 25, 2003, the European Commission issued a
Statement of Objections challenging MasterCard Europe’s
cross-border MIF. MasterCard Europe filed its response to this
Statement of Objections on January 5, 2004. MasterCard
Europe is engaged in discussions with the European Commission in
order to determine under what conditions, if any, the European
Commission would issue a favorable ruling regarding MasterCard
Europe’s MIF. If MasterCard is unsuccessful in obtaining a
favorable ruling, the European Commission could issue a
prohibition decision ordering MasterCard to change the manner in
which it calculates its cross-border MIF. MasterCard could
appeal such a decision to the European Court of Justice. Because
the cross-border MIF constitutes an essential element of
MasterCard Europe’s operations, changes to it could
significantly impact MasterCard International’s European
members and the MasterCard business in Europe. In addition, a
negative decision by the European Commission could lead to the
filing of private actions against MasterCard by merchants
seeking substantial damages.

United Kingdom Office of Fair Trading.

On
September 25, 2001, the Office of Fair Trading of the
United Kingdom (“OFT”) issued a Rule 14 Notice
under the U.K. Competition Act 1998 challenging the MasterCard
MIF, the fee paid by acquirers to issuers in connection with
point of sale transactions, and multilateral service fee
(“MSF”), the fee paid by issuers to acquirers when a
customer uses a MasterCard-branded card in the United Kingdom
either at an ATM or over the counter to obtain a cash advance.
Until recently, the MIF and MSF were established by MasterCard
U.K. Members Forum Limited (formerly MEPUK) (“MMF”)
for domestic credit card transactions in the United Kingdom. The
notice contained preliminary conclusions to the effect that the
MasterCard U.K. MIF and MSF may infringe U.K. competition law
and do not qualify for an exemption in their present forms. In
January 2002, MasterCard, MEPUK and several MasterCard U.K.
members responded to the notice. On February 11, 2003, the
OFT issued a supplemental Rule 14 Notice, which also
contained preliminary conclusions challenging MasterCard’s
U.K. MIF under the Competition Act. On May 2, 2003,
MasterCard and MMF responded to the supplemental notice. On
November 10, 2004, the OFT issued a third notice (now
called a Statement of Objections) claiming that the MIF
infringes U.K. competition law. In February 2005,
MasterCard and MMF responded to the Statement of Objections. An
oral hearing has been scheduled for March 2, 2005.

On November 18, 2004, MasterCard’s board of directors
adopted a resolution withdrawing the authority of the U.K.
members to set domestic MIFs and MSFs and conferring such
authority exclusively on MasterCard’s President and Chief
Executive Officer. As a result, if MasterCard and MMF are
unsuccessful in obtaining a favorable ruling in the current
proceeding, the OFT would have to commence a new proceeding for
the purpose of ordering MasterCard to change the manner in which
it calculates its U.K. MIF. The OFT has informed MasterCard
that, if it issues a prohibition decision in the current
proceedings, it is likely to commence a new proceeding
challenging MasterCard’s setting of MIFs. Because the MIF
constitutes an essential element of MasterCard’s U.K.
operations, negative decisions by the OFT in the current or any
future proceedings could have a significant adverse impact on
MasterCard’s U.K. members and on MasterCard’s
competitive position and overall business in the U.K. In
addition, a negative decision by the OFT could lead to the
filing of private actions against MasterCard by merchants
seeking substantial damages. In the event of a negative decision
by the OFT in the current proceeding, MasterCard and MMF intend
to appeal to the Competition Appeals Tribunal and to seek
interim relief. Similarly, it is likely that MasterCard would
appeal a negative decision by the OFT in any future proceeding
to the Competition Appeals Tribunal and to seek interim relief.

United States.

In July 2002, a purported class
action lawsuit was filed by a group of merchants in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California against
MasterCard International, Visa U.S.A., Inc., Visa International
Corp. and several member banks in California alleging, among
other things, that MasterCard’s and Visa’s interchange
fees contravene the Sherman Act. The suit seeks treble damages
in an unspecified amount, attorney’s fees and injunctive
relief, including the divestiture of bank ownership of
MasterCard and Visa, and the elimination of MasterCard and Visa
marketing activities. On March 4, 2004, the court dismissed
the lawsuit with prejudice in reliance upon the approval of the
Settlement Agreement in the U.S. merchant lawsuit by the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of New York, which held
that the settlement and release in that case extinguished the
claims brought by the merchant group in the present case. The
plaintiffs have appealed the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of New York’s approval of the U.S. merchant
lawsuit settlement and release to the Second Circuit Court of
Appeals and have also appealed the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California’s dismissal of the present
lawsuit to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. On
January 4, 2005, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals issued
an order affirming the District Court’s approval of the
U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement agreement, including the
District Court’s finding that the settlement and release
extinguished such claims. Plaintiffs’ time in which to seek

On October 8, 2004, a new purported class action lawsuit
was filed by a group of merchants in the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of California against MasterCard
International, Visa U.S.A., Inc., Visa International Corp. and
several member banks in California alleging, among other things,
that MasterCard’s and Visa’s interchange fees
contravene the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act. The complaint
contains similar allegations to those brought in the interchange
case described in the preceding paragraph, and plaintiffs have
designated it as a related case. The plaintiffs seek damages and
an injunction against MasterCard (and Visa) setting interchange
and engaging in “joint marketing activities,” which
plaintiffs allege include the purported negotiation of merchant
discount rates with certain merchants. On November 19,
2004, MasterCard filed an answer to the complaint.

Other Jurisdictions.

MasterCard is aware that regulatory
authorities in certain other jurisdictions, including Poland,
Spain, New Zealand, Portugal, Mexico, Colombia, South Africa and
Switzerland are reviewing MasterCard’s and/or its
members’ interchange fees and/or related practices and may
seek to regulate the establishment of such fees and/or such
practices.

Note 17.

Settlement and Travelers Cheque Risk Management

Settlement risk is the legal exposure due to the difference in
timing between the payment transaction date and subsequent
settlement. Settlement risk is estimated using the average daily
card charges during the quarter multiplied by the estimated
number of days to settle. The Company has global risk management
policies and procedures, which include risk standards to provide
a framework for managing the Company’s settlement exposure.
MasterCard International’s rules generally guarantee the
payment of MasterCard transactions and certain Cirrus and
Maestro transactions between principal members. The term and
amount of the guarantee are unlimited. Member-reported
transaction data and the transaction clearing data underlying
the settlement risk exposure calculation may be revised in
subsequent reporting periods.

In the event that MasterCard International effects a payment on
behalf of a failed member, MasterCard International may seek an
assignment of the underlying receivables. Subject to approval by
the Board of Directors, members may be assessed for the amount
of any settlement loss.

MasterCard requires certain members that are not in compliance
with the Company’s risk standards in effect at the time of
review to post collateral, typically in the form of letters of
credit and bank guarantees. This requirement is based on
management review of the individual risk circumstances for each
member that is out of compliance. In addition to these amounts,
MasterCard holds collateral to cover variability and future
growth in member programs; the possibility that it may choose to
pay merchants to protect brand integrity in the event of
merchant bank (acquirer) failure, although it is not
contractually obligated to do so; and Cirrus and Maestro related
risk. MasterCard monitors its credit risk portfolio on a regular
basis to estimate potential concentration risks and the adequacy
of collateral on hand. Additionally, from time to time, the
Company reviews its risk management methodology and standards.
As such, the amounts of uncollateralized estimated settlement
exposure relating to non-compliant members are revised as
necessary.

Estimated settlement exposure, and the portion of the
Company’s uncollateralized settlement exposure for
MasterCard-branded transactions that relates to members that are
deemed not to be in compliance with, or

that are under review in connection with, the Company’s
risk management standards, at December 31, 2004 and 2003
were as follows:



MasterCard-branded transactions:

Cirrus and Maestro transactions:

Gross legal settlement exposure

$

$

591,317

Although MasterCard holds collateral at the member level, the
Cirrus and Maestro estimated settlement exposures are calculated
at the regional level. Therefore, these settlement exposures are
reported on a gross basis, rather than net of collateral. For
the quarter ended December 31, 2004, a significant portion
of the increase in Cirrus and Maestro estimated settlement
exposures ($492,745) was attributable to the conversion of
non-branded transactions to Maestro transactions in the United
Kingdom.

MasterCard’s estimated settlement exposure under the
MasterCard brand, net of collateral, had concentrations of 56%
and 58% in North America and 23% and 22% in Europe at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

A significant portion of uncollateralized settlement exposure
attributable to non-compliant members is concentrated in three
members ($163,786 and $157,955 for December 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively).

MasterCard guarantees the payment of MasterCard-branded
travelers cheques in the event of issuer default. The guarantee
estimate is based on all outstanding MasterCard-branded
travelers cheques, reduced by an actuarial determination of
cheques that are not anticipated to be presented for payment.
The term and amount of the guarantee are unlimited. MasterCard
calculated its MasterCard-branded travelers cheques exposure
under this guarantee as $1,172,533 and $1,205,921 at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

A significant portion of the Company’s credit risk is
concentrated in one MasterCard traveler’s cheque issuer.
MasterCard has obtained an unlimited guarantee estimated at
$969,593 and $996,927 at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, from a financial institution that is a member, to
cover all of the exposure of outstanding travelers cheques with
respect to that issuer. In addition, MasterCard has obtained
guarantees estimated at $28,592 and $32,101 at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively, from financial institutions that
are members in order to cover the exposure of outstanding
travelers cheques with respect to another issuer. These
guarantee amounts have also been reduced by an actuarial
determination of cheques that are not anticipated to be
presented for payment.

Based on the Company’s ability to assess its members for
settlement and travelers cheque losses, the effectiveness of the
Company’s global risk management policies and procedures,
and the historically low level of losses that the Company has
experienced, management believes the probability of future
payments for settlement and travelers cheque losses in excess of
existing reserves is negligible. However, if circumstances in
the future change, the Company may need to reassess whether it
would be necessary to record an obligation for the fair value of
some or all of its settlement and travelers cheque guarantees.

Note 18.

Acquisition of Europay International S.A.
    (“EPI”) (the “Integration”)

MasterCard acquired, directly and indirectly, 100% of the shares
of EPI not previously owned by MasterCard International pursuant
to a Share Exchange and Integration Agreement, dated as of
February 13, 2002, entered into by MasterCard, MasterCard
International and EPI (the “Integration Agreement”).
EPI, now MasterCard Europe, is the Company’s principal
operating subsidiary in Europe. MasterCard Europe’s primary
business is to license a full range of payment programs and
services to financial institutions in the European region and to
provide a set of information processing and transaction delivery
services to these institutions. The Integration has allowed
MasterCard International and MasterCard Europe to form an
integrated, global payments company with a single management
team and governance structure. The results of EPI’s
operations have been included in the consolidated financial
statements of the Company from June 28, 2002.

Purchase Price for EPI

MasterCard Incorporated issued 23,760 shares to the shareholders
of EPI and MasterCard Europay U.K. Limited (“MEPUK”)
in the Integration, in return for directly and indirectly
acquiring 100% of the shares of EPI not previously owned by
MasterCard International. However, of the 23,760 shares issued,
only 17,610 were considered to be issued unconditionally. The
share exchange agreements, under which the shares were issued,
are described in Note 19, “Stockholders’
Equity”, herein. As discussed more fully below, the
purchase price for EPI was based on the estimated value of the
unconditional shares only, and this estimated value was
determined on the basis of an independent valuation. Considering
this valuation and the 17,610 unconditional shares issued, the
purchase price of EPI was $267,856, excluding estimated
acquisition costs of $10,486 that were incurred by the Company.

In calculating the purchase price of EPI, the Company considered
only the unconditional shares issued to the former shareholders
of EPI and MEPUK because the Integration Agreement provides that
the number of shares allocated to these shareholders will
potentially increase or decrease at the end of a three-year
transition period as a result of the application of a global
proxy formula for the third year of the transition period. Of
the 23,760 shares attributable to the exchange of EPI and MEPUK
shares, 6,150 shares are conditional shares subject to
reallocation at the end of the transition period. EPI and MEPUK
shareholders therefore received 17,610 unconditional shares at
closing.

Since former EPI and MEPUK shareholders would retain or receive
additional shares of MasterCard Incorporated at the end of the
transition period without remitting any additional
consideration, any shares retained or received by them that are
above their minimum allocation at that time would constitute a
part of the purchase price. Any such additional shares would be
valued at that time based upon the fair value of the stock of
MasterCard Incorporated. Any such reallocation of shares to
former EPI and MEPUK shareholders will increase the purchase
price for EPI and, accordingly, the amount of goodwill and
additional paid-in capital recorded.

Fair Value of EPI Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed

The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed at June 28, 2002,
the date of the acquisition of EPI in the Integration, as
determined based on an independent appraisal, and also reflects
subsequent refinements to the estimated fair values as discussed
below. Certain

balances for assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been
reclassified to conform to MasterCard presentation for
consistency:

Subsequent to the acquisition date of EPI, the purchase price
allocation was refined and amounts were reallocated among the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The table above has
been adjusted to reflect these refinements, which include a
$7,166 increase to the exit cost liability estimate, a $4,836
decrease to the deferred tax estimate, a $4,911 decrease to the
value assigned to certain capitalized software technologies and
a $7,240 increase to goodwill. Changes to the exit cost
liability are discussed below and the changes to goodwill are
provided in Note 6.

Pursuant to the Integration Agreement, the bylaws of MasterCard
International adopted on June 28, 2002 provide that the
Company will assume the first $7,000 of losses or liabilities
that relate to any breach of EPI’s representations or
warranties in the Integration Agreement. Any such losses or
liabilities in excess of $7,000 could, under MasterCard
International’s bylaws, be levied against MasterCard
International’s European members as an assessment.
MasterCard anticipates that certain former EPI liabilities could
trigger this bylaw provision. The $7,000 is included in total
liabilities assumed above.

Note 19.

Stockholders’ Equity

The authorized capital stock of MasterCard Incorporated consists
of 275,000 shares of class A redeemable common stock, par
value $.01 per share (of which 84,000 shares are issued and
outstanding); 25,000 shares of class B convertible common
stock, par value $.01 per share (of which 16,000 shares are
issued and outstanding); and 75,000 shares of class C
common stock, par value $.01 per share (of which no shares are
issued or outstanding). Class C common stock may be issued
from time to time with voting powers, designations, preferences
and other rights to be determined by the MasterCard board of
directors, in compliance with certain limitations, as set forth
in the certificate of incorporation of MasterCard.

MasterCard capital stock is privately held by certain of the
Company’s customers. Transfer of shares of common stock and
assignment of the right to receive shares is not permitted,
except under specific circumstances, until July 1, 2005.
After July 1, 2005, each stockholder must maintain an
ownership percentage of common stock that is no less than 75%
and no more than 125% of the most recent global proxy
calculation, which is the formula set forth in the MasterCard
Incorporated’s bylaws to determine the allocation of shares
to stockholders based on their business contributions to the
MasterCard Incorporated. Stockholders may be required to
purchase or sell shares of MasterCard in order to satisfy these
requirements. Only principal members of MasterCard International
may hold shares of MasterCard.

If a stockholder of MasterCard ceases to be a principal member
of MasterCard International before July 1, 2005, the common
stock may be redeemed at par value. After July 1, 2005,
MasterCard Incorporated may, at its option, redeem the common
stock of a stockholder that ceases to be a principal member of
MasterCard International for the book value of the shares, based
on MasterCard’s financial statements most recently filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If MasterCard
Incorporated does not redeem the stockholder’s shares, a
stockholder ceasing to be a member of MasterCard International
after July 1, 2005 will be required to offer the unredeemed
shares to the other stockholders of MasterCard in accordance
with procedures to be established by the board of directors.

The class A and B shares were issued on June 28, 2002,
pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of
February 13, 2002, in which MasterCard International merged
with a subsidiary of MasterCard Incorporated (the
“Conversion”). In the Conversion, each principal
member of MasterCard International received shares of
class A redeemable common stock and class B
convertible common stock of MasterCard, representing each
member’s existing equity interest in the Company.
Additionally, each principal member of MasterCard International
received a class A membership interest in MasterCard
International, representing that member’s continued rights
as a licensee to use MasterCard’s brands, programs,
products and services. MasterCard Incorporated owns the sole
class B membership interest in MasterCard International,
entitling MasterCard Incorporated to exercise all economic
rights and substantially all voting rights in MasterCard
International. MasterCard International is the Company’s
principal operating subsidiary.

In connection with the Conversion, MasterCard acquired EPI,
which is described Note 18 herein. In connection with the
Integration Agreement, each shareholder of EPI (other than
MasterCard International and MEPUK) entered into a separate
share exchange agreement pursuant to which it exchanged its EPI
shares for shares of class A redeemable and class B
convertible common stock of MasterCard. The shareholders of
MEPUK entered into an agreement pursuant to which they exchanged
their MEPUK shares for class A and class B stock of
MasterCard. As a result of the Integration, EPI and MEPUK became
wholly-owned subsidiaries of MasterCard. MEPUK’s sole asset
is shares of EPI (now MasterCard Europe). In addition, under the
terms of the Integration Agreement, class B convertible
common stock will automatically be converted into class A
redeemable common stock on or about July 1, 2005, except
for certain shares of



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share data)

class B stock attributable to the ec Pictogram brand in
Europe (“ec Picto shares”). In accordance with the
Integration Agreement, the shares of class A stock will
then be reallocated among the stockholders of MasterCard as of
that date. The ec Picto shares will automatically be converted
into class A stock and reallocated on or about July 1,
2007, in accordance with the terms of the Integration Agreement.

Note 20.

Foreign Exchange Risk Management

The Company enters into foreign exchange contracts to minimize
risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements
denominated in foreign currencies and the possible changes in
value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. MasterCard’s
forward contracts are classified by functional currency as
summarized below:

The currencies underlying the foreign currency forward contracts
consist primarily of euro, Swiss francs, Japanese yen and U.K.
pounds sterling. The fair value of the foreign currency forward
contracts generally reflects the estimated amounts that the
Company would receive or (pay), on a pre-tax basis, to terminate
the contracts at the reporting date based on broker quotes for
the same or similar instruments. The terms of the foreign
currency forward contracts are generally less than
18 months. The Company has deferred $3,497 and $3,069 of
net losses, after tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income
as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, all of
which is expected to be reclassified to earnings within the next
twelve months to provide an economic offset to the earnings
impact of the anticipated cash flows hedged.

The Company’s derivative financial instruments are subject
to both credit and market risk. Credit risk is the risk of loss
due to failure of a counterparty to perform its obligations in
accordance with contractual terms. Market risk is the potential
change in an investment’s value caused by fluctuations in
interest and currency exchange rates, credit spreads or other
variables. Credit and market risk related to derivative
instruments were not material at December 31, 2004 and 2003.

Generally, the Company does not obtain collateral related to
forward contracts because of the high credit ratings of the
counterparties that are members. The amount of accounting loss
the Company would incur if the counterparties failed to perform
according to the terms of the contracts is not considered
material.

Segment Reporting

In accordance with SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,”
MasterCard has one reportable segment, “Payment
Services.” All of the Company’s activities are
interrelated, and each activity is dependent upon and supportive
of the other. Accordingly, all significant operating decisions
are based upon analyses of MasterCard as one operating segment.
The President and Chief Executive Officer has been identified as
the chief operating decision-maker. During 2004, MasterCard had
one customer which generated approximately $315,000 revenues,
which are greater than 10 percent of the Company’s
revenues.

Revenue by geographic market is based on the location of our
customer that issued the cards which are generating the revenue.
Revenue generated in the U.S. was approximately 58%, 63% and 61%
of total revenues in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. No
individual country, other than the U.S., generated more than 10%
of total revenues in either period. MasterCard does not maintain
or measure long-lived assets by geographic location.

Controls and
Procedures

MasterCard Incorporated’s management, including the
President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, carried out an evaluation of the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Report.
Based on that evaluation, the Company’s President and Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that
MasterCard Incorporated had effective disclosure controls and
procedures for (i) recording, processing, summarizing and
reporting information that is required to be disclosed in its
reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s rules and forms and (ii) ensuring that
information required to be disclosed in such reports is
accumulated and communicated to MasterCard Incorporated’s
management, including its President and Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding disclosure.

In addition, MasterCard Incorporated’s management assessed
the effectiveness of MasterCard’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. In a report
included in Item 8 herein, management concluded that based
on its assessment, MasterCard’s internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004.

Item 9B.

Other
Information

On February 28, 2005, MasterCard Incorporated amended its
bylaws to add Article III, Section 2.1 which provides
for an adjustment to the Global Proxy Calculation (as defined in
the bylaws) for the last year of the Transition Period (as
defined in the bylaws) and for each of the following seven years
to account for the impact of the U.S. merchant lawsuit
settlement. In addition, the provision in Article IV,
Section 5 has been removed, which provided that the
regional president of Europe was an honorary member of the board
of directors of MasterCard Incorporated. MasterCard
Incorporated’s amended and restated bylaws are included in
Exhibit 3.1(b) to this Report.

On February 28, 2005, MasterCard entered into an addendum
agreement with Robert W. Selander, the Company’s President
and Chief Executive Officer, which modified his employment
agreement, dated August 10, 2001. The addendum agreement
provides for a retention payment of $10,000,000
(ten million U.S. dollars) to Mr. Selander
provided that he remains employed by MasterCard in good standing
until a date to be established by MasterCard’s board of
directors no earlier than April 9, 2010, but no later than
April 9, 2011 (the “Retention Date”), meets
certain performance standards and provides requested assistance
in identifying his successor and transitioning his
responsibilities to such person. Under certain circumstances
Mr. Selander may be entitled to a pro rata portion of the
retention payment if his employment is terminated prior to the
Retention Date. Mr. Selander’s receipt of the
retention payment is further conditioned upon his agreement to
generally applicable 36-month non-compete and non-solicitation
covenants, subject to shorter periods if he is terminated for
cause or if he resigns as a result of a change in the strategic
direction of MasterCard to which he objects, and his execution
of a release of liability in favor of MasterCard. The addendum
agreement is included as Exhibit 10.9.1 to this Report.

The Company maintains several compensation plans in which its
executives participate. Among these plans are MasterCard
International Incorporated’s Annual Incentive Compensation
Plan (“AICP”), Annuity Bonus Program and Deferral
Plan, which are described below and included as exhibits to this
Report.

The AICP rewards employees for successfully achieving
performance goals that are in direct support of the
Company’s corporate and business unit/region goals. The
plan is funded based on overall corporate performance with
funding allocated to each division based on corporate and
business unit/region performance. Actual awards are based on
corporate, business unit/region and individual performance
against goals. Target



AICP opportunities are determined based on competitive market
practices and internal equity considerations. The AICP is
included as Exhibit 10.14 to this Report.

The Annuity Bonus Program is a non-qualified, after-tax savings
plan designed to provide employees with benefits and
contributions to the extent amounts under the Company’s
qualified plans are capped by IRS limitations. Each year, the
Company pays participants a bonus distributed in the form of a
premium payment to a tax-deferred annuity contract. The Annuity
Bonus Program is included as Exhibit 10.15 to this Report.

The Deferral Plan allows employees, whose total cash
compensation (base salary and annual incentive) is at a
predetermined amount, to defer base salary in excess of the IRS
qualified plan compensation limits and up to 90% of annual and
long-term incentive payments. Amounts deferred may be invested
in market funds or a fixed rate option with a minimum guaranteed
return of 4%. The Deferral Plan is included as
Exhibit 10.16 to this Report.

A description of the Company’s non-employee director annual
compensation arrangement is included as Exhibit 10.17 to
this Report.

On November 17, 2004, the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors of the Company (the “Compensation
Committee”) approved the annual base salaries, effective as
of February 1, 2005, of the Company’s executive
officers. The following table sets forth the annual base
salaries of the Company’s Named Executive Officers, as
defined in Item 402(a)(3) of Regulation S-K,
(determined as of December 31, 2004) for 2005:

In addition, the Compensation Committee set the 2005 annual
incentive target awards under the AICP for the Named Executive
Officers, as follows:

Name

Target Annual Incentive

Mr. Selander

200% of salary

Mr. Heuer

100% of salary

Mr. McElhatton

0% of salary

(1)

Mr. Thom

100% of salary

Mr. Hanft

100% of salary

(1)

The Compensation Committee did not approve a 2005 annual

objectives for the 2005-2007 performance period are based on the

markets, improving customer focused strategy, achieving

Principal
Accountant Fees and Services

MasterCard’s independent registered public accounting firm,
PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”), has notified the
Audit Committee of the board of directors that PwC performed
certain limited services for the Company and other PwC clients
that were inconsistent with standards for auditor independence
under applicable rules. Specifically, PwC has disclosed to the
Audit Committee that, during 2001, an affiliate of PwC performed
tax preparation services for expatriate employees of MasterCard
located in China. PwC held funds from MasterCard of less than
$15,000 to pay taxes to local authorities in connection with
these services. PwC’s associated fees for these services
were less than $900. The services were terminated in 2001.
Custody of the funds of an audit client is not permitted under
applicable auditor independence rules. Among other things, PwC
has reported its findings to the Securities and Exchange
Commission and is undertaking a systematic investigation of
these issues.

PwC has advised the Audit Committee that PwC’s objectivity
and audit independence were not impaired by these activities.
PwC has confirmed to the Audit Committee that it is an
independent accounting firm with respect to the Company, as
defined under applicable auditor independence rules. The Audit
Committee has discussed PwC’s independence in light of
these disclosures. The Company is not aware of any other
non-audit services performed by PwC that were inconsistent with
standards for auditor independence under applicable rules.

The other information required by this Item appears under
“Auditors Services and Fees” in the Proxy Statement
