MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

FISCAL YEAR 2003 FORM 10-K ANNUAL
REPORT


i


Item 1.

Business

MasterCard Incorporated is a leading global
payment solutions company that provides a variety of services
principally in support of our customers’ credit, deposit
access (debit), electronic cash and related payment programs. We
manage a family of well-known, widely accepted payment card
brands including MasterCard®, MasterCard
Electronic

TM

, Maestro® and Cirrus®, which
we license to our customers. We also provide our customers with
a sophisticated set of information and transaction processing
services, and establish and enforce rules and standards
surrounding the use of cards carrying our brands. Using our
transaction processing services, our customers facilitate
payment transactions between cardholders and merchants
throughout the world, providing merchants with an efficient and
secure payment option, and consumers and businesses with a
convenient payment vehicle accepted worldwide. In addition, we
undertake a variety of marketing activities designed to maintain
and enhance the value of our brands. We work with our customers
and other industry partners to develop innovative new
technologies and applications for our payment programs,
including in the areas of electronic and mobile commerce and
chip-based “contact” and “contactless” cards.

On a global scale, we process transactions
denominated in more than 160 currencies. In 2003, our gross
dollar volume (“GDV”) as reported by our customers was
$1.272 trillion, a 5.9% increase (on a local currency
basis) over the GDV generated in 2002. GDV represents gross
usage (purchase and cash transactions) on MasterCard-branded
cards for goods and services, including balance transfers and
convenience checks. These figures exclude Maestro and Cirrus
transactions. At December 31, 2003, the total number of
MasterCard cards in circulation worldwide as reported by our
customers was 632.4 million, a 7.0% increase from 2002.

We conduct our business principally through
MasterCard Incorporated’s principal operating subsidiary,
MasterCard International Incorporated (“MasterCard
International”), a Delaware membership corporation. The
principal members of MasterCard International and its affiliates
are approximately 2,600 financial institutions worldwide that
participate directly in our payment programs. In addition, there
are approximately 22,300 affiliate members of MasterCard
International and its affiliates that participate in our payment
programs through one or more principal members. The common stock
of MasterCard Incorporated is owned by principal members of
MasterCard International. In Europe, we conduct our business
principally through MasterCard Europe sprl (“MasterCard
Europe”), formerly Europay International S.A., a wholly
owned subsidiary of MasterCard Incorporated acquired on
June 28, 2002 in a transaction that we refer to as the
“Integration.” For a description of the Integration
and MasterCard’s related conversion to a stock company, see
Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.

Through MasterCard International, our business is
structured as an open bankcard association, in which cardholder
and merchant relationships are managed principally by our
customers. Our customers are the principal and affiliate members
of MasterCard International, which we refer to collectively as
our “customers” or “members.” Accordingly,
we do not issue cards, set cardholder fees or determine the
interest rates (if applicable) charged to cardholders using
cards that carry our brands. We refer to the customers that
issue our cards as “issuers” and those that enroll
merchants into programs to accept our cards as
“acquirers.”

Because our business is global, we have
structured our organization to be sensitive to the requirements
of the regions and countries in which we operate. Our global
board of directors has delegated authority over a variety of
matters, including certain rulemaking, enforcement and
fee-setting decisions, to regional boards of directors covering
each of Asia/ Pacific, Canada, Europe, Latin America and the
Caribbean, South Asia — Middle East/ Africa
(“SAMEA”), and the United States. We enter into
business agreements with key customers around the globe, which
allow us to support the individual needs of these customers with
tailored pricing and other business arrangements in exchange for
significant volume, share and other commitments to MasterCard.
At the same time, we seek to provide best-in-class service to
all of our customers, irrespective of their size.

We establish a multilateral interchange fee
(“MIF”) in certain circumstances as a default fee that
applies when there is no other interchange fee arrangement in
place between an issuer and an acquirer. Interchange fees
represent a sharing of payment system costs among the financial
institutions participating in a four-party payment card system
such as ours. Generally, interchange fees are paid by acquirers
to issuers in connection with transactions initiated with our
cards. These fees reimburse the issuer for a portion of the costs



incurred by it in providing services which are of
benefit to all participants in the system, including acquirers
and merchants. We establish a variety of MIF rates depending on
such considerations as the location and the type of transaction,
and collect the MIF on behalf of the institutions entitled to
receive it. As described more fully below in “Risk
Factors — Interchange fees are the subject of
increasingly intense regulatory scrutiny worldwide, which may
adversely affect our business,” MIFs are subject to
regulatory or legal review and/or challenges in a number of
jurisdictions.

We earn revenue primarily from the fees we charge
our customers for providing transaction processing and payment
services, and from assessments on the dollar volume of activity
on cards carrying our brands. We earn a portion of our revenues
in connection with MasterCard-branded offline debit cards in the
United States. We also generate a significant amount of revenue
from processing foreign currency transactions for our customers.
For a description of legal and other risks associated with these
revenues, see “—Risk Factors”.

We use the term “MasterCard” to refer
to the MasterCard brand generally, and to the business conducted
by MasterCard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries,
including MasterCard International and MasterCard Europe. We use
the term “card” to refer to the plastic cards carrying
our brands and those of our competitors, together with the
underlying credit, charge, deposit or asset account.

Payment Services

Transaction Processing

We operate a network that links issuers and
acquirers around the globe for transaction processing services
and, through them, permits MasterCard cardholders to use their
cards at millions of merchants worldwide. Our transaction
processing services (primarily authorization, clearing and
settlement) are provided to customers through our proprietary,
worldwide computer and telecommunications network. We provide
global transaction processing services principally through our
Global Technology and Operations headquarters in O’Fallon,
Missouri.

Authorization, Clearing and Settlement.

The authorization, clearing and
settlement process facilitates the movement of transaction data
and funds among customers on a global basis in a timely and
efficient manner.

Authorization is the process by which a
transaction is approved by the issuer or, in certain
circumstances, by MasterCard or others on behalf of the issuer
in accordance with the issuer’s instructions. We processed
over 9.6 billion MasterCard-branded authorizations on our global
processing systems in 2003. MasterCard’s network provides
for the transmission of authorization requests and results among
issuers, acquirers and other transaction processors or networks.
Our rules, which may vary across regions, establish the
circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek
authorization of transactions.

Clearing is the exchange of financial transaction
information between the issuer and the acquirer after a
transaction has been completed. MasterCard transactions are
generally cleared through our centralized processing system,
known as the Global Clearing Management System (GCMS), and the
related information is typically routed among customers via our
Banknet data transport network.

Once transactions have been authorized and
cleared, MasterCard provides services in connection with the
settlement of the transaction — that is, the exchange
of funds along with associated fees. Settlement is provided
through our Settlement Account Management (SAM) system.
Once clearing is completed, a daily reconciliation is provided
to each customer involved in settlement, detailing the net
amounts by clearing cycle and a final settlement position. The
actual exchange of funds takes place between a clearing bank
chosen by the customer and approved by MasterCard, and a
settlement bank chosen by MasterCard. Customer settlement occurs
in U.S. dollars or in other selected currencies, in accordance
with established rules.

We also operate the MasterCard Debit Switch
(“MDS”), which principally supports the processing of
Cirrus and Maestro transactions. The MDS switches financial
messages, provides transaction and statistical reporting, and
performs clearing and settlement between customers and other
debit transaction processing



networks. Unlike the authorization and clearing
processes described above, which involve the exchange of
transaction data in two discrete messages (one for authorization
and again for clearing); the MDS generally operates as a
“single message” system in which clearing occurs
simultaneously with the initial authorization request.

A significant portion of the intra-country (as
opposed to cross-border) transaction activity conducted with
MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus cards is authorized, cleared
and/or settled by our customers or other processors without the
involvement of MasterCard’s central processing systems. We
do not earn transaction processing fees for such activity. We
are developing and promoting domestic processing solutions for
our customers that are designed to leverage our significant
investments in our global and regional processing systems.

Operations and Systems.

Our transaction processing services
are available 24 hours per day, every day of the year. In the
event that our main processing facility in O’Fallon,
Missouri, becomes disabled, we have a back-up system located at
a separate facility in Kansas City, Missouri. Our transaction
processing systems have redundant power supplies and back-up
processes to ensure continued operation in the event of a fault.
We consistently maintain core systems availability for our
global processing systems at a rate in excess of 99.9%.

Regional Transaction Processing.

Following the Integration, we provide
transaction processing (authorization, clearing and settlement)
services for customers in the Europe region through our
subsidiary MasterCard Europe. These services, which allow
European customers to facilitate payment transactions between
cardholders and merchants throughout Europe, are provided via
our European Payment Systems Network (“EPS-Net”).
EPS-Net is a telecommunications network that interfaces directly
with our global Banknet system for worldwide retail payment and
automated teller machine (“ATM”) transaction
interchange. We are presently in the midst of a multi-year
technical convergence project to fully integrate EPS-Net with
our global processing systems. In connection with this
initiative, we are integrating key applications and systems and
standardizing formats to enhance customer service, increase
operating efficiencies and reduce processing costs. We also
operate a separate regional processing facility for the Asia/
Pacific region in Australia.

RPPS.

MasterCard’s Remote Payment and
Presentment Service (“RPPS”) is a leading processor of
electronic bill payments in the United States. MasterCard
RPPS® provides routing, editing, settlement and
reconciliation services and also offers electronic bill
presentment and processing of credit counseling payments and
debt management plans. RPPS transmits over 300 million
payments annually.

Anti-Fraud Initiatives

Our customers are principally responsible for
fraud losses associated with the cards they issue or the
merchants from whom they acquire transactions. However, we
develop programs and systems to aid our customers in detecting
and preventing the fraudulent use of cards carrying our brands.
We prepare, sell and distribute an electronic “warning
bulletin” to customers showing invalid and other recently
terminated account numbers as identified by our customers. We
have a number of other prevention initiatives targeted at
fraudulent cardholder activity. As one example, our System to
Avoid Fraud Effectively (SAFE) program compiles
customer-submitted data regarding fraudulent transactions into
reports designed to help issuers and acquirers improve fraud
detection and prevention. In addition, our RiskFinder®
system is designed to help customers to predict fraud and reduce
losses by evaluating transactions using a number of variables.
We also target fraudulent activity at the merchant level. For
example, through our Merchant Audit Program, we identify
merchants with significant fraud-related transaction activity
and encourage these merchants to implement fraud control
procedures. Our Member Alert to Control High-Risk Merchants
(MATCH) program assists acquirers in assessing risk before
signing a merchant into their MasterCard acceptance. MasterCard
also offers Aristion, a flexible software package designed to
help our customers monitor fraud and money laundering.

Security and cardholder authentication for remote
channels are critical issues facing MasterCard’s customers
and merchants who engage in electronic commerce transactions,
where a signed cardholder sales



receipt is generally unavailable. MasterCard is
seeking to address these issues through the implementation of
MasterCard SecureCode

TM

, a global Internet
authentication solution that permits cardholders to authenticate
themselves to their issuer through the use of a unique, personal
code. In addition, MasterCard has developed the MasterCard Site
Data Protection Service

TM

, which allows e-commerce
merchants, third-party service providers and data storage
entities to assess their security situation on a regular basis
for potential vulnerabilities.

Other Payment Related
    Services

Our MasterCard Advisors group provides our
customers with a wide range of tailored services associated with
their payment programs. In 2003, MasterCard Advisors introduced
new services in the areas of research, customer relationship
management and database marketing, credit cycle management
consulting, and information technology consulting. MasterCard
Advisors charges our customers fees for these services. At this
time, MasterCard Advisors does not make a material contribution
to our revenues.

Within MasterCard Advisors, our marketing
consulting group provides customized consulting to customers in
the area of cardholder marketing, including acquisition,
portfolio management and loyalty consulting designed to help
expand our customers’ businesses. Our operations
consultants provide advice principally in connection with
back-office processes, program management and change management.
We also provide consulting services to customers regarding risk
management activities. Our customer relationship management and
database mining groups provide data-based solutions for more
effective customer acquisition and retention programs. Our
Purchase Street Research group provides subscription-based
research and local marketplace research products for the
payments industry.

Our Worldwide Cardholder Services group develops,
manages and markets a range of services to customers globally to
support the features that are offered in connection with certain
of our card programs, such as lost and stolen card reporting and
emergency card replacement services. In conjunction with
licensed insurance companies, we also support certain of our
customers’ purchase assurance, extended warranty, and
collision/damage waiver programs. In addition, our loyalty
rewards services group provides customers with comprehensive
support of their card-based loyalty rewards programs and
consulting on loyalty rewards programs globally.

Brand Building

We manage and promote the MasterCard brand for
the benefit of all customers through umbrella advertising,
promotional and sponsorship initiatives. We strive to have our
cardholders associate the MasterCard brand with “The Best
Way to Pay for Everything that Matters®”. Our approach
to marketing activities combines advertising, sponsorships,
promotions, interactive media and public relations as part of an
integrated package designed to increase consumer awareness of
MasterCard and to drive usage of MasterCard cards. We also seek
to tailor our global marketing messages by optimizing their use
in individual countries, while maintaining a common global theme.

Advertising, Promotions and
    Sponsorships

Our advertising plays a critical role in building
brand visibility, usage and loyalty among cardholders globally.
Our award-winning “Priceless®” advertising
campaign, launched in the United States in 1997, has run in 47
languages across 96 countries. The “Priceless”
campaign promotes MasterCard’s universal acceptance and
usage benefits that permit cardholders to pay for what they
need, when they need it. It also provides MasterCard with a
consistent, recognizable message that supports our brand
positioning.

In order to promote usage of our cards, we
sponsor frequent promotions on a regional and national basis,
often in conjunction with merchants or our customers. In the
United States, we sponsor MasterCard Exclusives

TM

, a
collection of promotional programs and select merchant offers
that customers can insert into their cardholder statements, and
MasterCard Exclusives Online®, a permission-based e-mail
and Internet website program providing cardholders with access
to exclusive merchant offers.



We seek to increase MasterCard brand awareness
and preference, and to encourage card usage and loyalty, by
sponsoring a variety of sporting and entertainment properties
that support the “Priceless” campaign and MasterCard
brand positioning. In soccer, MasterCard is the exclusive
payment system sponsor of the FIFA World Cup, which we believe
is the single largest sporting event in the world. We also
sponsor other leading soccer events, including the UEFA European
Championship and UEFA Champions League in Europe. In golf, we
are a sponsor and the preferred card of the PGA Tour, the
Champions Tour, the PGA of America, the LPGA and other events.

In North America, in addition to golf, we have
major sports sponsorship investments in professional baseball,
ice hockey and football. In baseball, we are the exclusive
payments brand sponsor of Major League Baseball
(“MLB”) and a sponsor of the MLB All-Star Game, both
League Championship Series and the World Series. We have also
established separate marketing and sponsorship arrangements with
numerous MLB teams. In hockey, we are the preferred card and a
sponsor of the National Hockey League, the National Hockey
League Players Association and the Canadian Hockey League. In
addition, in professional football, we have established
sponsorship arrangements with several National Football League
teams.

We sponsor a number of leading events in the
entertainment segment, including the BRIT Awards in the U.K. In
December 2002, as part of our marketing strategy in family
entertainment, we initiated a long-term sponsorship arrangement
with certain business units of Vivendi/ Universal that entitles
MasterCard to marketing and promotional programs with certain of
Universal’s motion picture, theme park, music and video
properties.

Merchant Acceptance
    Initiatives

Based on information from our customers and other
sources, we estimate that, at December 31, 2003, cards
carrying MasterCard brands were accepted at over 22 million
locations around the world. Acceptance locations include
merchant locations, ATMs and other locations where cash may be
obtained. In certain countries, reporting of merchant locations
includes all acceptance terminals deployed at individual
merchants; terminals supported by multiple acquirers of the same
merchant may be counted more than once in the compilation of the
data. The number of acceptance locations stated above has been
revised as compared to information previously released by
MasterCard to reflect these and other industry practices, and to
reduce the impact of regional variations in the reporting of
such data. Despite this revision, when the change in methodology
is applied historically, we continue to see a longer-term trend
of substantial growth in MasterCard brand acceptance.

In the area of acceptance, we aim to maintain the
unsurpassed acceptance of MasterCard-branded products by
focusing on three core initiatives. First, we seek to increase
the number of payment channels where MasterCard products are
accepted, such as by introducing MasterCard acceptance in
connection with mobile commerce payment applications. Second, we
seek to increase the number of categories of merchants that
accept our products. We are focused presently on expanding
acceptance in electronic commerce environments, in fast
throughput businesses such as fast food restaurants, and in
connection with public sector payments (including those
involving taxes, fees, fines and tolls), among other categories.
Third, we seek to increase usage of our products at selected
merchants by sponsoring a range of promotional programs from
time to time. We also enter into arrangements with selected
merchants under which these merchants provide incentives or
discounts for the use of MasterCard-branded products or
otherwise indicate a preference for MasterCard-branded products
when accepting payments from consumers.

We also support technical initiatives designed to
make MasterCard product acceptance more attractive for specific
merchants, such as our Quick Payment Service for fast food
restaurants and other merchants where rapid transactions are
required. In December 2002, we initiated a market trial of
MasterCard PayPass

TM

, a new “contactless”
payment solution that enables consumers simply to tap or wave
their payment card on a specially equipped terminal. In 2003, we
successfully completed pilot programs for MasterCard PayPass in
Orlando, Florida and Dallas, Texas. PayPass is designed to help
our customers grow their business by capturing income on
transactions that were previously cash-based, and increasing
card activity on underutilized card accounts.



We view recurring payments as a significant
opportunity to expand MasterCard card acceptance and usage in
the United States and elsewhere, and we are working with
customers to encourage consumers to make recurring bill payments
in a variety of categories — including telephone,
cable, utilities and insurance — on their
MasterCard-branded cards.

Finally, we provide research, marketing support
and financial assistance to our customers and their partners in
connection with the launch and marketing of co-branded and
affinity card programs. Co-branded cards are payment cards
bearing the logos or other insignia of an issuer and a marketing
partner, such as an airline or retail merchant. Affinity cards
are similar to co-branded cards except that the issuer’s
marketing partner is typically a charity, educational or similar
organization.

MasterCard Payment Programs

MasterCard supports a wide range of payment
solutions to enable our customers to design, package and
implement programs targeted to the specific needs of their
customers. Our principal payment programs, which are facilitated
through our brands — MasterCard, Maestro, Cirrus and
Mondex — are listed below:

Consumer Programs — Credit and
    Charge

MasterCard administers a number of consumer
credit and charge programs that are designed to meet the needs
of our customers for customized programs addressed to specific
consumer segments. Standard MasterCard cards are general purpose
credit cards targeted to consumers with basic needs for a credit
card. Gold MasterCard cards are targeted to consumers typically
requiring a higher line of credit or spending limit and one or
more card enhancement services associated with a card. Platinum
MasterCard cards are generally targeted to more upscale
consumers and offered with still higher credit lines or spending
limits. Platinum MasterCard cards also provide a full range of
card enhancement services. World MasterCard cards have no preset
spending limit and the option to revolve a designated portion of
the charges made. These cards are targeted principally for
travel and entertainment use and are accompanied with
best-in-class enhancement services and loyalty rewards programs.

The services provided in connection with all
MasterCard credit cards include lost/stolen card reporting,
emergency card replacement and emergency cash advance. Optional
services, such as emergency travel assistance, are also
available on many MasterCard cards. Cardholders can access these
and other services through MasterCard Global Service®, a
worldwide customer service program. Required services are
generally



provided through third-party service providers
arranged by MasterCard, including a licensed insurance company
retained by MasterCard to provide insurance services.

Our rules also permit our issuers to issue
“secured” MasterCard cards, in which all or a portion
of the cardholder’s line of credit is secured by
collateral, and “virtual” MasterCard cards, which are
MasterCard-branded payment accounts against which an embossed
card is generally not issued.

MasterCard Electronic cards offer additional
control and risk management features by requiring 100% issuer
authorization. The MasterCard Electronic program is designed to
curb fraud and control exposure in high risk markets. MasterCard
Electronic cards have been launched in the Asia/ Pacific,
Europe, Latin America/ Caribbean and SAMEA regions.

MasterCard has also created innovative, alternate
card forms to help our customers differentiate their programs.
MasterCard mc

2TM

cards are generally
chip-enabled and feature a distinctive cutaway corner.
MasterCard is working with our customers to launch
MasterCard mc


programs in the Europe, Latin
America/ Caribbean and Asia/ Pacific regions. In addition,
MasterCard Side Card

TM

, a sleek card in a tailored
case that attaches to a key ring or lanyard allowing for a quick
swipe at the point of sale, was introduced in the Latin America/
Caribbean region in 2003.

MasterCard has recently developed new consumer
credit programs, including the MasterCard Family Account and the
MasterCard Installment Card. The MasterCard Family Account
provides for a single, shared line of credit that allows the
primary cardholder to determine who receives a card and the
spending limits for each card. The MasterCard Installment Card
allows cardholders more flexible access to pre-approved
installment loans for large purchases, and can be implemented by
participating issuers in more than one configuration.

In 2003, we continued to work with our customers
in Europe to migrate the Eurocard® acceptance mark to
MasterCard in a number of countries, including Germany.

Consumer Programs — Deposit
    Access

MasterCard supports a range of payment solutions
that allow our customers to provide consumers with convenient
access to funds on deposit in checking, demand deposit and other
accounts. Transactions processed on a debit card generally
withdraw available funds directly from a cardholder’s
account in accordance with terms established by the issuer of
the card, and in some cases may involve an extension of credit
by the issuer. Our deposit access programs may be branded with
the MasterCard, Maestro and/or Cirrus marks, and can be used to
obtain cash in bank branches or at ATMs. In addition,
MasterCard- and Maestro-branded debit cards may be used to make
purchases at the point of sale. Debit cards carrying the
MasterCard brand allow cardholders to validate transactions at
the point of sale either by signing a sales receipt or, if the
card also bears a Maestro or ATM network mark and the merchant
has the necessary terminal, by entering a personal
identification number (“PIN”) at a terminal. Like our
consumer credit programs, we support debit Gold MasterCard
programs and debit Platinum MasterCard programs that issuers can
offer as premium services to cardholders. Issuers may also
provide enhancement services and loyalty rewards programs in
connection with debit cards carrying our brands.

Maestro is MasterCard’s online, PIN-based
global debit program. Typically, Maestro cards allow cardholders
to verify their identities by entering a PIN, although in
certain countries, cardholders are only required to sign a sales
receipt. Maestro cards are issued, and Maestro transactions are
processed, pursuant to a set of rules and procedures that are
separate from the rules applicable to MasterCard credit and
debit transactions. Based on information from our customers and
other sources, we estimate that, at December 31, 2003, the
Maestro brand mark appeared on approximately 520 million
cards worldwide and that Maestro was accepted for purchases at
more than 10 million merchant terminals.

The MasterCard ATM Network is among the
world’s largest global ATM networks, with more than 900,000
participating cash dispensing locations around the globe.
Generally, cardholders with cards bearing



the MasterCard, Maestro or Cirrus logo may use a
network ATM to access funds on deposit in their accounts (if a
debit card is used) or to obtain a cash advance (if a credit
card is used).

We make the Cirrus brand available to customers
to provide global cash access through the MasterCard ATM Network
for our customers’ proprietary ATM cards. Cirrus
transactions are validated by entering a PIN. Cirrus cards are
issued and processed pursuant to a set of rules and procedures
applicable specifically to ATM transactions.

In December 2003, MasterCard entered into a debit
processing alliance with eFunds Corporation, a leading provider
of electronic payments software and processing solutions. Under
the alliance, we market eFunds’ EFT processing services as
an integrated component of our debit programs. The alliance is
intended to add a flexible, end-to-end debit transaction
processing solution to the package of services and products
already available to our customers.

As a result of the Settlement Agreement in the
U.S. merchant lawsuit described in Item 3 —
Legal Proceedings herein, MasterCard has agreed to take a number
of actions to modify its MasterCard-branded debit card programs
in the United States. Among other things, MasterCard has adopted
rules that allow merchants to reject MasterCard-branded debit
cards issued in the United States, while still accepting other
MasterCard-branded cards, and vice versa. However,
U.S. merchants who choose to accept MasterCard-branded
debit cards must accept all MasterCard-branded debit cards.
Following the settlement, a small number of merchants, including
Wal-Mart, have announced that they will no longer accept
MasterCard-branded debit cards. The ability of merchants to
reject MasterCard-branded debit cards could adversely affect our
debit business in the United States. See “— Risk
Factors — Visa’s settlement service fee and the
ability of U.S. merchants to not accept MasterCard-branded
debit cards as a result of the settlement of the U.S. merchant
lawsuit could adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow
our debit card business in the United States.”

MasterCard is working to develop its debit
programs in key countries outside of the United States. During
2003, MasterCard Europe began authorizing and clearing
transactions for the members of S2 Limited, formerly known
as Switch Card Services Limited, which operate an electronic
domestic debit card network in the United Kingdom under the
Switch® brand, as part of an agreement to migrate Switch
branding and processing volume to the Maestro brand by 2007. In
Brazil, MasterCard launched MasterCard Maestro, a new debit card
brand, in 2003, following its acquisition of Redeshop®, one
of Brazil’s largest debit brands.

Corporate Payment Solutions

MasterCard’s corporate payment solutions
assist large corporations, mid-sized companies, small businesses
and public sector organizations in streamlining their payment
processes, managing information and reducing administrative
costs.

The MasterCard Corporate Card® is designed
to allow organizations to manage employee travel and
entertainment expenses. MasterCard Corporate Executive Cards,
marketed in such countries as the United States, Canada, Chile
and France, are targeted at senior executives and offer
increased spending limits, concierge services and worldwide,
24-hour customer service. MasterCard Corporate Purchasing Cards,
marketed globally, are designed to assist in the corporate
purchasing process and provide companies with access to enhanced
line item transaction detail. MasterCard Corporate Fleet Cards
provide companies with a way to monitor and control the expenses
of a commercial fleet at the vehicle or driver level, as well as
to capture and manage detailed spending data. Finally, the
MasterCard Corporate Multi Card® is an integrated card
program that combines the functionality of one or more of our
MasterCard corporate programs — travel, purchasing and
fleet — into a single card or account, thereby
reducing the costs of managing multiple card programs. We also
administer a variety of payment programs for public sector
entities that are similar to the travel, purchasing, fleet and
Multi cards offered to corporations. The MasterCard
BusinessCard® and Executive BusinessCard are targeted at
the small-business segment, offering business owners the ability
to extend payments and separate business expenses from personal
expenses.



MasterCard Smart Data Online, part of our suite
of reporting tools allows organizations ranging from small
businesses to large multinational corporations to display
cardholder statements, prepare management reports and integrate
charge data into their financial systems. Additionally,
MasterCard SmartLink

TM

, introduced in 2001,
integrating certain enterprise resource planning
(“ERP”) systems with the MasterCard Corporate
Purchasing Card so that transactional data generated at any
point of purchase worldwide by a company’s employees, can
be automatically downloaded. MasterCard Working

TM

is
a comprehensive set of small business payment solutions for
business owners.

Through our e-B2B strategy, MasterCard aims to
provide our customers with the ability to pursue new
opportunities in cash and check displacement, value exchanges of
any size, and fully electronic purchasing. Key to this strategy
are two new payment solutions, MasterCard e-P3 and
MasterCard ExpenSys. MasterCard e-P3 integrates the
MasterCard settlement process into electronic invoice payment
and presentment platforms, providing paperless, end-to-end
electronic commerce. MasterCard ExpenSys, a fully electronic
program for managing travel expenses provides our customers with
transaction data that can be sent to expense management
providers and leading independent suppliers.

Stored Value Programs

Stored value programs involve a balance account
that is funded with monetary value prior to use. The account may
be in the form of a traditional magnetic stripe or chip-enabled
payment card (prepaid cards), paper (travelers cheques), or an
electronic “purse” card (Mondex).

Prepaid.

MasterCard’s prepaid card
platform is a flexible tool that permits our customers to
develop, launch and manage host-based, magnetic stripe-enabled
prepaid card programs customized to the needs of unique
corporate and consumer segments. Prepaid card programs include
gift, teen, employee benefit, payroll, travel, incentive and
project management. There are a variety of MasterCard-branded
prepaid card programs in operation in all of our regions.

Travelers Cheques.

Travelers cheques are a paper-based,
prepaid form of payment for use at the point of sale and at bank
branches. MasterCard-branded travelers cheques, which are
available in a number of international currencies, are
refundable worldwide and can be replaced if lost or stolen.
MasterCard-branded travelers cheques are issued by a number of
customers around the world. For a description of our guarantee
obligations relating to travelers cheques, see Note 17 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.

Mondex.

The Mondex
electronic cash program, a chip-based, stored value payment
application, allows monetary value to be stored in an electronic
“purse” directly on Mondex-branded payment cards. The
Mondex purse application has been franchised, principally to
financial institutions, in several major national and regional
markets. Mondex cards permit the immediate transfer of value to
a merchant or between cards without the transaction being
authorized, cleared or settled through a central computer system.

Global e-Business and Emerging
Technologies

MasterCard is supporting innovation in the
payments industry with a number of initiatives, including
developments in the areas of electronic commerce, smart cards
and mobile commerce.

Electronic Commerce.

MasterCard’s Electronic Commerce
Center of Excellence, based in our Purchase, New York global
headquarters, manages MasterCard’s electronic commerce
offerings. This team seeks to ensure that MasterCard’s
consumer and corporate payment options play an important role in
payment channels that are developing as a result of the
continued evolution of the Internet and other electronic payment
channels. The team also identifies, tests and develops a range
of emerging technologies that offer new business opportunities
to MasterCard and our customers. In 2003, we continued to
integrate MasterCard payment solutions across a number of
vendors and platforms.

Smart Cards.

MasterCard’s Chip Center of
Excellence, based in Waterloo, Belgium, manages smart card
development for MasterCard. In the area of smart cards, we
currently are working with our customers to help them replace
traditional payment cards relying solely on magnetic stripe
technology with chip-enabled



payment cards. MasterCard has played a
significant role in the implementation of smart card technology.
As of December 31, 2003, more than 150 million smart
cards bearing MasterCard’s brands were issued worldwide.
MasterCard is currently working on implementing more than 400
individual chip-based programs around the world.

MasterCard’s “

One

SMART
MasterCard,” which offers a flexible and customized
approach to smart cards, provides our customers with support in
the areas needed to launch a successful smart card program. The
MasterCard Compliance Assessment and Security
Training (CAST) program helps customers evaluate the
security and risk of smart cards, including chip hardware,
operating systems platforms, and payment and non-payment
applications implemented on cards carrying our brands.

We are also involved in a number of organizations
that facilitate the development and use of smart cards globally.
For example, MasterCard owns a 50 percent interest in EMVCo,
LLC, a smart cards standards organization co-owned by Visa,
which maintains specifications that are designed to ensure
interoperability and acceptance of chip-based payment
applications on a worldwide basis. In 2003, EMVCo adopted a new
structure and expanded its charter to further ensure ongoing
interoperability and acceptance of chip-based payment
applications on a worldwide basis.

Mobile Commerce/Wireless.

In the area of mobile
commerce/wireless, MasterCard is working to develop standards
and programs that will allow consumers to conduct their
financial transactions securely using a variety of wireless
devices. MasterCard is a founding member and leader of the
Mobile Payment Forum, established in 2001 as a cross-industry
group dedicated to enabling secure, user-friendly mobile payment
transactions. As the use of cellular phone service continues to
grow around the world, MasterCard has developed a solution for
providing prepaid airtime payments using payment cards called
rePower, for which it has launched pilot programs in the United
States and South Africa. MasterCard is also focused on
development initiatives in the areas of radio frequency and
proximity payments.

Membership Standards

Rule Making and
    Enforcement

The stockholders of MasterCard Incorporated are
principal members of MasterCard International. Membership in
MasterCard International and its affiliates is generally open
only to banks and other regulated and supervised financial
institutions. Applicants for membership must meet membership
eligibility requirements and must be approved by the appropriate
regional MasterCard board of directors. In general, MasterCard
grants licenses by territory. To be approved as a member, an
applicant must be able to perform all obligations required of
members. Risk management reviews and anti-money laundering
(“AML”) due diligence reviews are conducted on all new
members prior to admission, as well as on existing members. All
applicants and members must meet the requirements of
MasterCard’s AML program.

As a condition of membership and licenses to use
our brands, members agree to comply with our bylaws, policies,
rules and operating regulations in effect from time to time
(“Standards”). MasterCard International and certain of
its affiliates are the governing bodies that establish and
enforce the Standards. The Standards relate to such matters as
membership eligibility and financial soundness criteria; the
standards, design and features of cards and card programs; the
use of MasterCard trademarks; merchant acquiring activities
(including acceptance standards applicable to merchants); and
guaranteed settlement, member failures and allocation of losses.

To help ensure that members conform to the
Standards, we run a number of compliance programs including
reviewing card programs proposed to be issued by members and
requiring members to undergo an annual audit by an independent
certified public accountant (or similar examination by a
regulatory authority). To tailor MasterCard’s programs and
services to the needs of local markets, our global and/or
regional boards have approved a number of variations to the
Standards applicable to specific regions.



Member Risk Management

As a secondary obligor of certain card
obligations of principal members, we are exposed to member
credit risk arising from the potential financial failure of any
of our approximately 2,600 principal members of MasterCard,
Maestro and Cirrus, and approximately 2,300 affiliate debit
licensees. Principal members participate directly in MasterCard
programs and are responsible for the settlement and other
activities of their sponsored affiliate members (numbering
approximately 22,300 in total).

To minimize the contingent risk to MasterCard of
a failure, we monitor principal members’ and affiliate
debit licensees’ financial health, economic and political
operating environments and compliance with our rules and
standards. If the financial condition of a member or the state
of a national economy in which a member operates indicates that
a member may not be able to satisfy its MasterCard settlement
obligations to other members or its payment obligations to
MasterCard merchants, we may require the member to post
collateral, typically in the form of letters of credit and bank
guarantees. In the event that a member becomes unable or
unwilling to meet its MasterCard settlement and/or program
obligations, we are able to draw upon such member’s
collateral account in order to keep ourselves and other members
from incurring losses. In addition to obtaining collateral from
members, in situations where a member is potentially unable to
meet its obligations to us or other members, we can block
authorization and settlement of transactions and ultimately
terminate membership.

For liquidity protection in the event of member
settlement failure, we have established a $1.2 billion
committed credit facility, which is subject to annual renewal.
In addition, we have the right to assess all or a portion of our
members for reimbursement for settlement or any other operating
losses, subject to certain limitations set forth in the bylaws
and other Standards of MasterCard. For a description of our
exposure to settlement and travelers cheque risk, see
Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included
herein.

Intellectual Property

We own a number of valuable trademarks that are
essential to our business, including MasterCard®,
Maestro® and Cirrus®, through one or more affiliates.
We also own numerous other trademarks covering various brands,
programs and services offered by MasterCard to support our
payment programs. Through license agreements with our customers,
we authorize the use of our trademarks in connection with our
customers’ card issuing and merchant acquiring businesses.
In addition, we own a number of patents and patent applications
relating to payments solutions, transaction processing, smart
cards, security systems and other matters, some of which may be
important to our future business operations.

Competition

MasterCard programs compete against all forms of
payment, including paper-based transactions (principally cash
and checks) and electronic transactions such as wire transfers
and Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) payments. While
we have gained share versus cash and checks in recent years,
these forms of payment still capture the largest overall
percentage of worldwide transaction volume. Within the global
general purpose card industry, we believe that Visa may have
significantly greater volume than us. In certain countries,
other competitors also have leading positions, such as JCB in
Japan.

The most common card-based forms of payment are
general purpose cards, which are payment cards carrying logos
that permit widespread usage of the cards within countries,
regions or around the world. General purpose cards may be
credit, charge or deposit access cards. Within the general
purpose payment card industry, we face substantial and
increasingly intense competition worldwide from systems such as
Visa (including Plus, Electron and Interlink), American Express,
JCB, Diners Club and Carte Blanche, among others. In specific
countries, we face significant competition from other
competitors such as Discover/ Novus (United States), Interac
(Canada) and Bankcard and EFTPOS (Australia). We also encounter
competition from businesses such as retail stores and petroleum
(gasoline) companies that issue their own payment cards, as
well as from ATM/ point-of-sale networks such as NYCE, Star,
PULSE and others.



Our competitors include operators of proprietary
end-to-end payment networks that have direct acquiring
relationships with merchants and direct issuing relationships
with cardholders, such as American Express. These competitors
have certain advantages that we do not enjoy. Among other
things, these competitors do not require formal interchange fees
to balance payment system costs among issuers and acquirers,
because they have direct relationships with both merchants and
cardholders. Interchange fees, which are characteristics of
four-party payments systems such as ours, are subject to
increased regulatory scrutiny worldwide. See Note 16 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for
information regarding interchange fees and the related
regulatory challenges. Because they do not utilize formal
interchange fees, operators of end-to-end payment networks to
date have avoided the same regulatory scrutiny we face and,
accordingly, may enjoy a competitive advantage over four-party
payment systems such as ours.

In addition, ongoing litigation has and may
continue to affect our ability to compete in the global payments
industry. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included herein. Under the Settlement Agreement in
the U.S. merchant lawsuit, U.S. merchants now have the
right to reject MasterCard-branded debit cards issued in the
United States while still accepting other MasterCard-branded
cards, which may adversely affect our ability to maintain and
grow our debit business in the United States. Following the
settlement, a small number of merchants, including Wal-Mart,
have announced that they will no longer accept
MasterCard-branded debit cards. In addition, if we ultimately
are unsuccessful in our litigation with the U.S. Department
of Justice concerning our Competitive Programs Policy, some of
our customers may choose to do business with American Express or
Discover, which would adversely affect our business. On
January 29, 2004, MBNA Corporation announced its intention
to offer American Express credit cards to its customers.
Finally, we are being sued in several state and federal courts
because of our currency conversion practices. The outcome of
these lawsuits potentially could require us to change our
currency conversion practices, which may have a negative impact
on our business. We do not know what the final outcome will be
of our various litigations and other regulatory proceedings.

In addition to proprietary end-to-end networks,
we compete intensely with other bankcard associations,
principally Visa, for the loyalty of our customers. In most
countries throughout the world, including the United States,
financial institutions typically issue both MasterCard- and
Visa-branded payment cards. As a result of this structure, known
as “duality”, we compete with Visa for business on the
basis of individual card portfolios or programs. In some
countries, particularly Canada, card issuers are
“non-dual”, meaning that they issue either MasterCard
or Visa payment cards, but not both. Issuance of MasterCard and
Visa debit cards is generally non-dual in the United States as
well. In non-dual countries, we compete with Visa for the entire
book of a customer’s business. Significant ongoing
consolidation in the banking industry may result in a financial
institution with a substantial MasterCard portfolio being
acquired by an institution that has a strong relationship with
Visa, resulting in the loss of business for MasterCard. In
particular, in the first quarter of 2004, J.P. Morgan
Chase, the parent of one of our largest principal members and
stockholders, announced its intention to acquire BankOne, a
financial institution principally aligned with Visa. The loss of
a material portion of our current business with Chase as a
result of this transaction could have a material adverse impact
on our revenues and business prospects.

In the United States, we believe that
MasterCard-branded transactions account for a smaller share of
all off-line, signature-based debit transactions than they do
credit or charge transactions. In addition, many of our
competitors process a greater number of on-line, PIN-based debit
transactions at the point of sale than we do, since our Maestro
brand has relatively low market penetration in the United
States. In recent years, we believe that off-line and on-line
debit has grown more rapidly than credit or charge transactions.
If we are unable to maintain and grow our debit business in the
United States, the reputation of our brands and overall business
may suffer. In addition, our business and revenues could be
impacted adversely by any tendency among U.S. consumers or
financial institutions to migrate from off-line, signature-based
debit transactions to on-line, PIN-based transactions, because
the latter types of transactions are more likely to be processed
by ATM/ debit point-of-sale networks as opposed to us.

We also face competition from transaction
processors such as First Data Corporation, some of which are
seeking to build networks that link issuers directly with
point-of-sale devices for payment card transaction authorization
and processing services. In particular, we believe that First
Data’s acquisition of Concord/ EFS



will enable First Data to process significant
debit transaction volumes. Similarly, some of our competitors
provide currency conversion services at the point-of-sale
through Dynamic Currency Conversion, or DCC, which is an
alternative to the MasterCard currency conversion system. These
networks could reduce our transaction processing volumes, which
could have a material adverse impact on our revenues.

We also compete against new entrants that have
developed alternative payment systems. Among other things, these
competitors provide Internet currencies that can be used to buy
and sell goods on-line, “virtual checking” programs
that permit the direct debit of consumer checking accounts for
on-line payments, and services that support payments to and from
proprietary accounts for Internet, mobile commerce and other
applications. A number of these new entrants rely principally on
the Internet to support their services, and may enjoy lower
costs than we do.

In mobile commerce, we face competition from
established network operators, who today manage millions of
consumer relationships and possess key advantages for
facilitating payments across mobile devices. Whereas the
MasterCard approach to mobile commerce centers on the use of the
consumer’s payment account as established by their card
issuer, network operators may apply mobile consumer payments
directly to the customer’s monthly bill.

We believe that the principal factors affecting
our competitive position in the global payments industry are:

Government Regulation

Government regulation impacts key aspects of our
business. We are subject to regulations that affect the payment
industry in the many jurisdictions in which our cards are used.
In particular, interchange fees associated with four-party
payment systems such as MasterCard’s are being reviewed or
challenged in various jurisdictions. See Note 16 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.

MasterCard is subject to a variety of employment,
health and safety, environmental and other forms of government
regulation in the ordinary course of its business. MasterCard
customers are subject to numerous regulations applicable to
banks and other financial institutions in the United States and
elsewhere, and as a consequence MasterCard is at times impacted
by such regulations. Certain of MasterCard’s operations are
periodically reviewed by the Federal Financial Institutions
Examination Council. In addition, aspects of our operations or
business may be subject to privacy regulation in the United
States, the European Union and elsewhere, as well as regulations
imposed by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign
Assets Control. MasterCard Europe operates a retail payment
system in Europe and, effective in 2003, is subject to oversight
by the National Bank of Belgium (“NBB”) pursuant to
standards published by the European Central Bank. The NBB’s
oversight of MasterCard Europe is principally addressed at
managing financial, legal and operations risk.

MasterCard and other participants in the payment
industry are subject to the regulatory requirements of
Section 352(a) of the Uniting and Strengthening America by
Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct
Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “USA PATRIOT Act”). The USA
PATRIOT Act has



required MasterCard to create and implement a
comprehensive anti-money laundering program, and has imposed
similar requirements on some of our customers.

Employees

As of December 31, 2003, we employed
approximately 4,000 persons, of which approximately 1,200
were employed outside the United States. We consider our
relationship with our employees to be good.

SEC Reports

Our periodic reports filed with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are available for
review on our website at www.mastercardintl.com. The information
contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into
this Report.

Risk Factors

Interchange fees are the subject of
increasingly intense regulatory scrutiny worldwide, which may
adversely affect our business.

Interchange fees, including MasterCard’s
MIFs, are the subject of increasingly intense regulatory
scrutiny worldwide. For example, in the European Union, the
European Commission has issued a Statement of Objections
challenging MasterCard’s cross-border MIF under European
Union competition rules. If MasterCard is unsuccessful in
obtaining an exemption to these rules, the European Commission
could order MasterCard to change the manner in which it
calculates its cross-border MIF. In the United Kingdom, the
Office of Fair Trading (“OFT”) has issued a
Rule 14 Notice under the U.K. Competition Act 1998
challenging the MasterCard MIF and multilateral service fee
(“MSF”), claiming that the MIF and MSF may infringe
U.K. competition law and do not qualify for an exemption in
their present forms. In Australia, the Reserve Bank of Australia
(“RBA”) has enacted regulations which impose a number
of changes on the operation of four-party credit card systems.
In the United States, a class-action suit has been filed by
merchants alleging, among other things, that our interchange
fees violate federal antitrust laws. Interchange fees are also
being reviewed in a number of other jurisdictions, including
Poland, Spain, New Zealand and Switzerland. See Note 16 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein for a
complete description of these proceedings.

If issuers are unable to charge interchange fees
or are forced to reduce interchange fees, they may be unable to
recoup the costs incurred for their services. This could reduce
the number of financial institutions willing to participate in a
four-party payment card system, lower overall transaction
volumes, and/or make proprietary end-to-end networks (such as
those offered by American Express and Diners Club) or other
forms of payment more attractive. Issuers could also attempt to
balance the expense of their card programs by seeking a
reduction in the fees that we charge. If MasterCard is less
successful than Visa in defending interchange fees, we could
also be competitively disadvantaged against Visa. In Australia,
we believe that the RBA’s regulations have already
benefited our competitors operating proprietary end-to-end
networks. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in our defense of
our and our members’ interchange fees, regulation of
interchange fees could have an adverse impact on our revenues,
our prospects for future growth, and our overall business.

In addition to interchange fees, the
payments industry is the subject of increased regulatory focus
in the United States and elsewhere, which may impose costly new
compliance burdens on MasterCard and its customers and lead to
decreased transaction volumes through MasterCard’s
systems.

Regulation of the payments industry, including
regulation applicable to MasterCard and our customers, has
increased significantly in recent years. For example, in 2002
MasterCard became subject to the regulatory requirements of
Section 352(a) of the USA PATRIOT Act. The
USA PATRIOT Act has required MasterCard to create and
implement a comprehensive anti-money laundering program, and has
imposed similar requirements on our customers. The
U.S. Congress is presently considering regulatory
initiatives in the areas of Internet gambling, Internet
prescription drug purchases and privacy, among others, that
could impose additional compliance burdens on MasterCard or our
customers. Most states in the U.S. are considering a



variety of legislation as well. Various
regulatory agencies are also considering regulations covering
identity theft, account maintenance guidelines, privacy,
disclosure rules, and account breach notification that would
impact our customers directly. In 2004, a number of regulations
will be issued implementing the Fair and Accurate Credit
Transactions Act, or FACT Act, which, among other things, makes
permanent the preemptive effect of several key provisions of the
Fair Credit Reporting Act that could have a material impact on
our customers’ businesses. Increased regulatory focus on
MasterCard may increase our costs, which would negatively impact
our financial performance. Similarly, increased regulatory focus
on our customers may cause them to reduce the volume of
transactions processed through our systems, which would reduce
our revenues and also negatively impact our financial
performance.

Our business may be adversely impacted by
the European Union’s adoption of regulation on cross-border
payments denominated in Euros.

In December 2001, the European Parliament and the
Council of the European Union adopted a new regulation requiring
that bank charges for cross-border payments denominated in euros
be the same as for similar transactions within a single member
state. This regulation is being adopted incrementally through
January 2006. Payments in non-euro currencies will also be
subject to the regulation if the member states where those
currencies are used notify the European Commission that they
want the rules to apply. Because a reduction in cross-border
transaction fees will reduce the profitability of certain
services offered by MasterCard’s European customers, it may
cause them to modify or withdraw these services. If such changes
result in an overall decline in transaction volumes, our
revenues from European operations may decline.

Visa’s settlement service fee and the
ability of U.S. merchants to not accept MasterCard-branded
debit cards as a result of the settlement of the
U.S. merchant lawsuit could adversely affect our ability to
maintain and grow our debit card business in the United
States.

In June 2003, Visa enacted a bylaw requiring its
100 largest issuers of debit cards in the United States to
pay a so-called “settlement service fee” if the
issuers reduce their debit Visa volume by more than 10%. This
bylaw was later modified to clarify that the settlement service
fee would only be imposed if an issuer shifted its portfolio of
debit cards to MasterCard. Visa implemented this bylaw provision
following the settlement of the U.S. merchant lawsuit
described in Item 3 — Legal Proceedings. For a
description of MasterCard’s response to this bylaw
provision, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included herein. If Visa is permitted to impose this
settlement service fee on issuers of debit cards according to
this bylaw, it would penalize Visa members seeking to do debit
business with MasterCard and would effectively prevent them from
converting their debit card programs to the MasterCard brand. In
addition, under the Settlement Agreement in the
U.S. merchant lawsuit, merchants have the right to reject
MasterCard-branded debit cards in the United States, while still
accepting other MasterCard-branded cards and vice versa. To
date, a small number of merchants, including a Wal-Mart, have
announced that they will no longer accept MasterCard-branded
debit cards. Either of these scenarios would be detrimental to
MasterCard’s ability to maintain and grow its debit card
business in the United States.

If we ultimately are unsuccessful in our
litigation with the U.S. Department of Justice our
Competitive Programs Policy would be repealed and our business
may suffer.

In 1998, the United States Department of Justice
(“DOJ”) filed suit against MasterCard International,
Visa U.S.A., Inc. and Visa International Corp. in the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York
alleging that certain aspects of the governance of MasterCard
and Visa were unlawful, and that MasterCard’s Competitive
Programs Policy (“CPP”) and a Visa bylaw provision
that prohibit financial institutions participating in the
respective associations from issuing competing proprietary
payment cards (such as American Express or Discover) acted to
restrain competition. Although we were successful in defending
our governance structure at trial, the Second Circuit Court of
Appeals affirmed the trial court judge’s ruling that our
CPP and Visa’s bylaw constitute unlawful restraints of
trade under the federal antitrust laws. We will petition the
U.S. Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, requesting
that it review the decision of the Second Circuit. If we
ultimately lose our appeal, we would be forced to repeal the CPP
insofar as it applies to issuers and would be prevented from
enacting or enforcing any bylaw, rule, policy or practice that
prohibits our issuers from issuing general purpose credit or
debit cards in the United States on any other general purpose



card network (such as American Express or
Discover). A repeal of the CPP could cause our members to issue
fewer cards with our brand and enter into arrangements with our
competitors to issue cards, thereby reducing the volume of
transactions that we process. On January 29, 2004, MBNA
Corporation announced its intention to offer American Express
credit cards to its customers. In addition, for a period of two
years, we would also be required to permit any issuer with which
we entered into a long-term business agreement related to
MasterCard-branded cards to terminate such agreements without
penalty, provided that the reason for the termination is to
permit the issuer to enter into agreements with American Express
or Discover. Accordingly, a repeal of the CPP would have an
adverse affect on our business and revenues. We cannot predict
the final outcome of our lawsuit with the DOJ. See Note 16
to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.

If we lose any of our various lawsuits
relating to our currency conversion practices, our business
would be adversely affected.

We generate a significant amount of revenue from
processing foreign currency transactions for members. However,
we are defendants in several state and federal lawsuits alleging
that our currency conversion practices are deceptive,
anti-competitive or otherwise unlawful. A trial judge in
California has found that our currency conversion practice is
deceptive under California state law, and ordered that we
mandate that members disclose the currency conversion process to
cardholders in cardholder agreements, applications,
solicitations and monthly billing statements. The judge also
ordered unspecified restitution to California cardholders. On
December 29, 2003, we filed a notice of appeal. In
addition, we have been served with similar complaints in several
state courts seeking to, in effect, extend the judge’s
decision to MasterCard cardholders outside of California. We
have succeeded in having several of these cases transferred to
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
York and combined with putative federal class actions alleging
that our currency conversion practices violate federal antitrust
laws. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included herein.

If we are unsuccessful in defending against these
lawsuits, we may have to pay restitution to cardholders who make
claims that they used their cards abroad, or may otherwise be
required to modify our currency conversion practices. In
addition, some of our competitors provide point-of-sale currency
conversion services, which, if chosen by the cardholder, could
disintermediate our services from the relevant transaction. If
we are forced to change our pricing or practices for our
currency conversion processing, or if we process fewer
transactions because of competing services or otherwise, our
business would be adversely affected.

If we are found liable in any of the other
material litigations that have been brought against us, we may
be forced to pay damages and change our business practices or
pricing structure, any of which could have an adverse affect on
our revenues.

There are currently actions against MasterCard
International in 18 different state courts and the District of
Columbia. In a number of these state courts there are multiple
complaints against MasterCard International brought under state
unfair competition statutes on behalf of putative classes of
consumers. The claims in these actions mirror the allegations
made in the U.S. merchant lawsuit and assert that
merchants, faced with excessive merchant discount fees, have
passed these overcharges to consumers in the form of higher
prices on goods and services sold. Also, several lawsuits have
been commenced by merchants who have opted not to participate in
the plaintiff class in the U.S. merchant lawsuit. Neither
the consumer class actions nor the “opt out” merchant
litigations described above are covered by the terms of the
Settlement Agreement described in Item 3. — Legal
Proceedings. In addition to these litigations, we are also being
sued in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New
York and in the Superior Court of California in connection with
our assessment of chargeback transactions. We may also be sued
in the future by our customers, merchants or consumers for
substantial damages or injunctive relief in connection with our
business practices.

If we are unsuccessful in our defense against the
consumer class actions, the “opt out” merchant
lawsuits, the merchant chargeback litigations, or any other
material litigation, we may be forced to pay damages and/or
change our business practices and pricing structure, any of
which could have an adverse affect on our business. See
Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included
herein for a description of these and our other material legal
proceedings.



We face increasingly intense competitive
pressure on the prices we charge our customers, which may
adversely affect our revenues and profitability.

MasterCard generates revenues from the fees that
it charges its customers for providing transaction processing
and other payment services, and from assessments on the dollar
volume of activity on cards carrying our brands. Some of our
competitors are larger or have greater financial resources than
we do. In addition, continued consolidation in the banking
industry is producing a smaller number of larger customers,
which generally have a greater ability to negotiate pricing
discounts with MasterCard. Accordingly, we may be forced to
limit the growth of, or lower, our fees and assessments. In
addition, we seek to enter into business agreements with
customers through which we offer incentives and other support to
issue and promote our cards. In order to stay competitive, we
may have to increase the amount of these incentives. To date,
our rapid overall volume growth has allowed us to mitigate the
impact of pricing reductions or incentive increases. However, we
may not be able to process additional transaction volume or
provide additional services to our customers to compensate for
such lower fees or increased costs in the future, which would
adversely affect our revenues and profitability. In addition,
increased pressure on prices enhances the importance of cost
containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than
those relating to customer incentives. We may not be successful
in these efforts.

If we are unable to maintain our
relationships with our customers, or if our customers are unable
to maintain their relationships with cardholders or with the
merchants that accept our cards for payment, our business may be
adversely affected.

We are, and will continue to be, significantly
dependent on a number of relationships with other parties,
principally our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and
their further relationships with cardholders and merchants, to
support our programs and services. Most of our relationships
with our customers are not exclusive and may be terminated at
the convenience of our customers. Our customers can reassess
their commitments to us at any time in the future and/or develop
their own competitive services. In particular, the payments
industry is currently undergoing significant consolidations and
the merger of one or more of our customers with financial
institutions aligned with our competitors could have a material
adverse impact on our business and prospects.

Our business strategy calls for us to grow our
business by, among other things, entering into customized
agreements with customers around the globe. Like our other
customer relationships, these agreements are terminable by our
customers in a variety of circumstances. Examples of provisions
appearing in various agreements currently in effect that may
permit a customer to terminate its agreement include:

•

certain customers receiving more than one seat on
    a board of directors while others do not;

•

increasing the limit on voting rights of a
    customer to more than 25%; or

•

failing to elect certain persons to a MasterCard
    board (e.g., a stockholder holding more than 5% of
    MasterCard Incorporated common stock is entitled to cancel its
    business agreement if one of its employees does not have a board
    seat).

A number of our key customers are represented on
our board of directors. If any one of these customers were to
lose its representation on the board, this could have a
detrimental effect on our business relationship with that
customer. Conversely, a number of customers that we earn
substantial revenues from are principally aligned with one of
our competitors. A significant loss of revenues or transaction
volumes from these customers could have an adverse impact on our
business.

In addition, we may be required to permit issuers
with which we have entered into business agreements in the
United States to terminate those agreements without penalty as a
result of the antitrust litigation currently on appeal that was
brought against us by the DOJ, which is described in a separate
risk factor above. Accordingly, our business agreements with
customers may not reduce the risk inherent in our business that
customers may terminate their relationships with us in favor of
our competitors, or for other reasons, or might not meet their
contractual obligations to us.



We do not issue cards, set cardholder fees or
determine the interest rates (if applicable) charged to
cardholders using cards that carry our brands. Each MasterCard
issuer is responsible for determining these and most other
competitive card features. In addition, we do not solicit
merchants to process transactions or establish the discount rate
that merchants are charged for card acceptance, which are
responsibilities of our acquirers. As a result, much of our
business depends on the continued success and competitiveness of
our customers. In turn, our customers’ success is dependent
upon a variety of factors over which we have little or no
influence. If our customers become financially unstable, we may
lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk as
described below.

We rely on the continuing expansion of merchant
acceptance of our brands and programs. Although it is our
business strategy to invest in strengthening our brands and
expanding our acceptance network, there can be no guarantee that
our efforts in these areas will continue to be successful. If
the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows or reverses itself,
our business could suffer.

Our operating results may suffer because of
substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in
the global payments industry.

The global payments industry is highly
competitive. Some of our competitors have developed, or may
develop, substantially greater financial and other resources
than we have, may offer a wider range of programs and services
than we offer or may use more effective advertising and
marketing strategies to achieve broader brand recognition or
merchant acceptance than we have. We may not continue to be able
to compete effectively against these and the other threats
discussed under the heading “Competition.” As a
result, our revenues or income may decline.

Over the last several years, the banking industry
has undergone rapid consolidation, and we expect this trend to
continue in the future. Consolidation represents a competitive
threat for MasterCard because our business strategy contemplates
entering into business agreements with our largest customers in
exchange for significant business commitments to MasterCard.
Accordingly, the merger of one or more of our significant
customers with financial institutions that have strong
relationships with our competitors could have a material adverse
impact on our business and prospects. In particular, in the
first quarter of 2004, J.P. Morgan Chase, the parent of one of
our largest principal members and stockholders, announced its
intention to acquire Bank One, a financial institution
principally aligned with Visa. The loss of a material portion of
our current business with Chase as a result of this transaction
could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and
business prospects. In addition, one or more of our customers
could seek to merge with, or acquire, one of our competitors,
and any such transaction could have a material adverse impact on
our business and prospects.

In the United States, we believe that
MasterCard-branded transactions account for a smaller share of
all off-line, signature-based debit transactions than they do
credit or charge transactions. In addition, many of our
competitors process a greater number of on-line, PIN-based debit
transactions at the point of sale than we do, since our Maestro
brand has relatively low market penetration in the United
States. In recent years, we believe that off-line and on-line
debit has grown more rapidly than credit or charge transactions.
If we are unable to maintain and grow our debit business in the
United States, the reputation of our brands and overall business
may suffer. In addition, our business and revenues could be
impacted adversely by any tendency among U.S. consumers or
financial institutions to migrate from off-line, signature-based
debit transactions to on-line, PIN-based transactions, because
the latter types of transactions are more likely to be processed
by ATM/debit point-of-sale networks as opposed to us.

As a secondary obligor of certain
obligations of principal members and affiliate debit licensees,
we are exposed to risk of loss in the event that any of our
members default on their MasterCard, Cirrus or Maestro
settlement obligations.

MasterCard settlement exposure materializes when
an issuer or acquirer fails to fund its daily settlement
obligations due to technical reasons, liquidity shortfall,
insolvency or other reasons. We quantify each member’s
settlement credit risk exposure by estimating the dollar value
of issuing and chargeback transactions that we would have to
fund in order to satisfy such member’s MasterCard, Maestro
or Cirrus-related obligations to other members. If a principal
or affiliate member is unable to fulfill its settlement
obligations to



other members, we may bear the loss, even if we
do not process the transaction. In addition, although we are not
contractually obligated to do so, we may elect to keep merchants
whole in the event that an acquirer defaults on its merchant
payment obligations, in order to maintain the integrity and
acceptance of our brands. Accordingly, one or more member
defaults could expose us to significant losses and reduce our
net income. For more information on our settlement exposure, see
Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included
herein.

The continuation of negative economic conditions
in 2003 caused significant increases in consumer bankruptcies
which led to increased write-offs of consumer credit card loans
by some of our members. These conditions caused the credit
quality of certain of our members to deteriorate. During 2003,
we generally responded to these instances of member credit
quality deterioration by increasing the level of collateral held
from members. Any decrease in the credit quality of a member
increases the risk of member default and can cause a member to
reduce the scope of its programs with MasterCard or voluntarily
terminate its MasterCard memberships and/or license, which could
have a negative impact on our revenues and net income.

Global economic, political and other
conditions may adversely affect our revenues.

The global payments industry is heavily dependent
upon the overall level of consumer spending. A sustained
deterioration in general economic conditions, particularly in
the United States or Europe, or increases in interest rates in
key countries in which we operate, may adversely affect our
financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase
amount of transactions involving payment cards carrying our
brands. In addition, a significant portion of the volume
generated on cards carrying our brands is associated with
cross-border business and leisure travel, which may be adversely
affected by world geopolitical and other conditions.

If we are not able to keep pace with the
rapid technological developments in our industry to provide
customers, merchants and cardholders with new and innovative
payment programs and services, the use of MasterCard-branded
cards could decline, which would reduce our revenues and
income.

The payment card industry is subject to rapid and
significant technological changes, such as continuing
developments of technologies in the areas of smart cards, radio
frequency and proximity payment devices, electronic commerce and
mobile commerce, among others. We cannot predict the effect of
technological changes on our business. We rely in part on third
parties, including some of our competitors and potential
competitors, for the development of and access to new
technologies. We expect that new services and technologies
applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge, and
these new services and technologies may be superior to, or
render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our card
programs and services. Our future success will depend, in part,
on our ability to develop or adapt to technological changes and
evolving industry standards and to provide end-to-end payment
solutions for our customers.

If our transaction processing systems are
disrupted or we are unable to process transactions securely,
efficiently or at all, our revenues or income would be
materially reduced.

Our transaction authorization, clearing and
settlement systems may experience service interruptions as a
result of fire, natural disasters, power loss, disruptions in
long distance or local telecommunications access, terrorism or
accident. Most of our transaction processing systems are
operated out of a single facility, supported by a separate
back-up facility. A natural disaster or other problem at our
primary and/or back-up facilities or our other owned or leased
facilities could interrupt our services. Additionally, we rely
on third-party service providers, such as AT&T, for the
timely transmission of information across our global data
transportation network. If a service provider fails to provide
the communications capacity or services we require, as a result
of natural disaster, operational disruption, terrorism or any
other reason, the failure could interrupt our services and
adversely affect the perception of our brands’ reliability
and our revenues or income.

In addition, our security protection measures,
including with respect to the security of transaction
information processed on our systems or the systems or
processing technology of third parties participating in our
network, may not be sufficient to prevent the fraudulent or
other improper use of cards carrying our brands. Unauthorized
use of our network potentially could jeopardize the security of
confidential information



stored in our computer systems or transmitted by
our customers or others. These factors may result in liabilities
for us or our customers, and could reduce our revenues and
income.

The growth of MasterCard Advisors and
Purchase Street Research may produce risks for our
business.

We are making significant investments in the
development of our consulting business, MasterCard Advisors, and
our research business, Purchase Street Research. At this time,
neither of these businesses make a significant contribution to
our revenues and because these businesses are still in their
early stages, their ability to generate future revenue and to
achieve profitability is uncertain. The continued development of
these businesses will require significant cash and time
investments and could have an adverse impact on our overall
profitability, result in the assumption of material additional
liabilities, make financial and operational consistency more
difficult to maintain and create other risks under the laws of
the jurisdictions in which they conduct business.

Because we have significant international
operations, we face additional risks related to political and
economic conditions in the countries in which we operate our
business.

We operate in, and intend to expand our business
further in, countries throughout the world. We cannot be sure
that we will be able to broaden our global operations in a
cost-effective manner or compete effectively in all of our
targeted countries. There are risks inherent in conducting
business internationally, any of which could adversely affect
our operations, including:

If these risks materialize, they could have a
material adverse effect on our business. We cannot assure you
that we will continue to develop and implement effective
policies and strategies in each location where we do business.

Adverse currency fluctuations and foreign
exchange controls could decrease revenues we receive from our
international operations.

During 2003, approximately 37% of our revenues
were generated from activities outside the United States. Some
of the revenues we generate outside the United States are
subject to unpredictable and indeterminate fluctuations if the
values of international currencies change relative to the
U.S. dollar. Resulting exchange gains and losses are
included in our net income. Our risk management activities
provide protection with respect to adverse changes in the value
of only a limited number of currencies. Furthermore, we may
become subject to exchange control regulations that might
restrict or prohibit the conversion of our revenue currencies
into U.S. dollars. The occurrence of any of these factors
could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Item 2.

Properties

As of December 31, 2003, MasterCard and its
subsidiaries owned or leased 58 properties. We own our
corporate headquarters, a three-story, 472,600 square foot
building located in Purchase, New York. There is no outstanding
debt on this building. Our principal technology and operations
center is a 528,000 square foot leased facility located in
O’Fallon, Missouri, known as “Winghaven”. The
term of the lease on this facility is 10 years which
commenced on August 31, 1999. See Note 13 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements



included herein. Our leased properties in the
United States are located in 9 states and in the District
of Columbia. We also lease properties in 36 other
countries. These facilities primarily consist of corporate and
regional offices, as well as our operations centers.

We believe that our facilities are suitable and
adequate for the business that we currently conduct. However, we
periodically review our space requirements and may acquire new
space to meet the needs of our business, or consolidate and
dispose of facilities that are no longer required.

Item 3.

Legal
Proceedings

Refer to Notes 3 and 16 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.

Settlement of U.S. Merchant
Lawsuit

In addition, as summarized in Note 3 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, commencing in
October 1996, several class action suits were brought by a
number of U.S. merchants — including Wal-Mart
Stores, Inc., Sears Roebuck & Co., Inc., The Limited
Inc. and Safeway, Inc. — against MasterCard
International and Visa U.S.A., Inc. (“Visa”)
challenging certain aspects of the payment card industry under
U.S. federal antitrust law. Those suits were later
consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of New York. The plaintiffs challenged
MasterCard’s “Honor All Cards” rule (and a
similar Visa rule), which requires merchants who accept
MasterCard cards to accept for payment every validly presented
MasterCard card. Plaintiffs claimed that MasterCard and Visa
unlawfully tied acceptance of debit cards to acceptance of
credit cards. In essence, the merchants desired the ability to
reject off-line, signature-based debit transactions (for
example, MasterCard card transactions) in favor of other payment
forms, including on-line, PIN-based debit transactions (for
example, Maestro or regional ATM network transactions) which
generally impose lower transaction costs for merchants. The
plaintiffs also claimed that MasterCard and Visa conspired to
monopolize what they characterized as the point-of-sale debit
card market, thereby suppressing the growth of regional networks
such as ATM payment systems. Plaintiffs alleged that the
plaintiff class had been forced to pay unlawfully high prices
for debit and credit card transactions as a result of the
alleged tying arrangement and monopolization practices.

On April 30, 2003, in lieu of proceeding
with trial, MasterCard International signed a Memorandum of
Understanding (“MOU”) with plaintiffs establishing an
agreement in principle, subject to execution of a settlement
agreement and approval by the District Court, to settle all
claims resulting from the litigation in return for certain
payments and injunctive relief. On June 4, 2003, MasterCard
and plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement (the
“Settlement Agreement”) that embodies the terms
originally set forth in the MOU. The Settlement Agreement
required MasterCard to pay $125,000,000 in 2003 and requires us
to pay $100,000,000 annually from 2004 through 2012. Also,
MasterCard was required to adopt rules by January 1, 2004
which permit U.S. merchants to elect not to accept
MasterCard-branded debit or credit cards, implement programs to
allow merchants to identify debit cards and provide signage to
merchants. In addition, the Settlement Agreement required
MasterCard to lower the effective debit interchange rate by 33%
during the period from August 1, 2003 to December 31,
2003. The Settlement Agreement also contains certain provisions
relating to the administration of the settlement, subject to the
orders of the District Court. In addition, the Settlement
Agreement provides that members of the plaintiff class in
existence on June 21, 2002 who did not opt out of the class
pursuant to the order of the District Court of that date will
not be provided with another opportunity to opt out of the class.

MasterCard denies all claims in this litigation
and nothing in the MOU or the Settlement Agreement constitutes
an admission of wrongdoing or liability by MasterCard. For the
full text of the Settlement Agreement, see Exhibit 10.1 to
the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of MasterCard for the
quarter ending June 30, 2003. For a narrative description
of the terms of the Settlement Agreement, see paragraphs 5
and 6 of Part II, Item 1 of the Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q of MasterCard for the quarter ending
June 30, 2003 incorporated by reference herein.



On December 19, 2003, the Court issued an
order and decision granting final approval to the settlement and
allocation plan. On January 23, 2004, the Court entered its
final judgment in this matter. Several members of the plaintiff
class have appealed the Court’s approval of the final
judgment.

On September 19, 2003, the Global Board of
Directors of MasterCard International determined that it would
not impose a special assessment on members in order to satisfy
the financial obligations in the Settlement Agreement.

Item 4.

Submission
of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of security
holders during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2003.

PART II

Item 5.

Market
for Registrant’s Common Equity and Related Stockholder
Matters

There is currently no established public trading
market for the common stock of MasterCard Incorporated. There
were approximately 1,275 holders of record of the common stock
of MasterCard Incorporated as of February 11, 2004. We do
not pay any cash dividends on our common stock and intend to
retain future earnings to fund the development and growth of our
business. Accordingly, we do not anticipate paying cash
dividends in the future. Payment of future dividends, if any,
would be at the discretion of our board of directors after
taking into account various factors, including our financial
condition, operating results and current and anticipated cash
needs. The common stock of MasterCard Incorporated is not
currently authorized to be issued in connection with any
compensation plan.

During the period covered by this Report,
MasterCard Incorporated did not make any sales of its equity
securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended.

Item 6.

Selected
Financial Data

On June 28, 2002, we converted from a
membership to a stock company through the creation of MasterCard
Incorporated, a new holding company. Also on June 28, 2002,
MasterCard Incorporated directly and indirectly acquired all of
the outstanding stock of Europay International S.A.
(“EPI”) in the transaction that we refer to as the
“Integration”. On July 16, 2002, EPI was renamed
MasterCard Europe S.A. On September 30, 2002, MasterCard
Europe was reorganized in Belgium as MasterCard Europe sprl.
Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included
herein more fully describes these transactions.

The selected consolidated financial data
presented below as of and for the years ended December 31,
2003 and 2002 were derived from the audited consolidated
financial statements of MasterCard Incorporated and its
consolidated subsidiaries, including MasterCard International
and MasterCard Europe. The results of MasterCard Europe’s
operations have been included in our consolidated statements of
operations from June 28, 2002. The data set forth below
should be read in conjunction with, and are qualified by
reference to, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the
Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included
elsewhere in this Report.



Set forth below are tables that provide
information regarding the performance results for the years
ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 for the payment programs
of MasterCard International and MasterCard Europe, the principal
operating subsidiaries of MasterCard Incorporated. The
information regarding MasterCard’s payment programs for the
year ended December 31, 2002 has been restated to conform
to the presentation of information in the table for the year
ended December 31, 2003 and to reflect revisions to certain
historical statistical information provided by MasterCard’s
members subsequent to the previous release of this information
by MasterCard. Among other adjustments, amounts for the year
ended December 31, 2002 have been adjusted to show off-line
debit volumes attributable to a member in Latin America not
previously reported by such member. This adjustment did not
materially impact our reported revenue.

The tables set forth in the gross dollar volume
(“GDV”), purchase volume, purchase transactions, cash
volume and cash transactions columns are derived from
information provided by MasterCard members that is subject to
logical and statistical verification by MasterCard and partial
cross-checking against information provided by MasterCard’s
transaction processing systems. The data set forth in the
accounts and cards columns is derived from information provided
by MasterCard members that is subject to logical and statistical
verification by MasterCard. A portion of the data set forth in
the tables is estimated. In particular, a portion of the data
set forth in the accounts and card columns reflects the impact
of routine portfolio changes among members and the other
practices that may lead to over counting of the underlying data
in certain circumstances. All data is subject to revision and
amendment by MasterCard’s members subsequent to the date of
its release. Growth rates over prior periods are provided for
volume-based data. European activity is included for the periods
presented, including periods prior to the Integration as
described in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included herein.

For purposes of the tables: GDV represents
purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of
balance transfers and convenience checks; purchase volume means
the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with
MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period; and cash
volume means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements
obtained with MasterCard-branded cards for the relevant period.
The number of cards includes virtual cards, which are
MasterCard-branded payment accounts for which functional cards
are not generally issued.

The MasterCard payment product is comprised of
both credit programs and off-line debit programs; certain data
relating to each type of program is included in the tables.
Credit programs include MasterCard-



branded credit and charge programs. Off-line
debit programs include MasterCard-branded debit programs where
the primary means of cardholder validation at the point of sale
is for cardholders to sign a sales receipt.

Information denominated in U.S. dollars is
calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/ local
currency exchange rate for each local currency in which
MasterCard volumes are reported. These exchange rates are
calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate
for each quarter. However, MasterCard reports period-over-period
rates of change in GDV, purchase volume and cash volume solely
on the basis of local currency information, in order to
eliminate the impact of changes in the value of foreign
currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of
change. Accordingly, the period-over-period rates of change set
forth in the tables cannot be extrapolated directly by reference
to dollar volume information presented by MasterCard for the
current and historical periods.

The tables include information with respect to
MasterCard-branded transactions that are not processed by
MasterCard and transactions for which MasterCard does not earn
revenues. Maestro and Cirrus on-line debit transactions, Mondex
transactions and other branded transactions are not included in
the tables.

Item 7.

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

The following discussion should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes
of MasterCard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries,
including MasterCard International Incorporated
(“MasterCard International”) and MasterCard Europe
sprl (“MasterCard Europe”)(together,
“MasterCard” or the “Company”) included
elsewhere in this report.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Report on Form 10-K contains
forward-looking statements pursuant to the safe harbor
provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. When used in this Report, the words “believe,”
“expect,” “could,” “may,”
“will” and similar words are intended to identify
forward-looking statements. These statements relate to our
future prospects, developments and business strategies. Many
factors and uncertainties relating to our operations and
business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and
many of which are outside of our control, influence whether any
forward-looking statements can or will be achieved. Any one of
those factors could cause our actual results to differ
materially from those expressed or implied in writing in any
forward-looking statements made by MasterCard or on its behalf.
We believe there are certain risk factors



that are important to our business, and that
could cause actual results to differ from our expectations.
Please see a complete discussion of these risk factors under the
caption “Risk Factors” in Item 1 —
Business of the Form 10-K.

Overview

Our revenues continued to grow, in spite of the
weakened economy in the first half of 2003 coupled with
decreased travel as a result of SARS and the conflict in the
Middle East. In certain markets, we are seeing positive results
from the expansion of our advertising and marketing support
initiatives. The primary focus of these initiatives is to build
brand recognition, promote brand acceptance, and enhance the
development of our programs and services. In 2003, revenues
increased by 18% of which 9% was due to the acquisition of
MasterCard Europe and 2% was due to the weakening of the dollar
against the euro creating a favorable currency translation. Our
operating expenses grew by 62% in 2003, of which 44% was due to
the settlement of the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal
settlements, 10% was due to the acquisition of MasterCard Europe
and 1% was due to the weakening of the dollar against the euro
creating an unfavorable currency translation.

The global payments industry is highly
competitive. We are and will continue to be significantly
dependent on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers
and their further relationships with cardholders and merchants,
to support our programs and services. Most of our relationships
with our customers are not exclusive and may be terminated at
the convenience of our customers. Currently the payments
industry is undergoing significant consolidations and the merger
of one or more of our customers with financial institutions
aligned with our competitors could have a material adverse
impact on our revenues.

Our financial results have been significantly
influenced by the legal and regulatory environment in which we
operate our business. During the current year, we settled the
U.S. merchant lawsuit and contract disputes with certain
customers, resulting in a pre-tax charge of $763 million.
We decided not to assess our members for these settlements and
plan on funding the settlement costs from operations as payments
are due. Due to the nature of our business, we believe the legal
and regulatory environment will remain a challenge in the coming
year, and we expect to devote a considerable amount of time and
resources to addressing it.

Legal and Regulatory Impact on our
    Business

We earn a portion of our revenues in connection
with MasterCard-branded offline debit cards in the United
States. Following the settlement of the U.S. merchant
lawsuit described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included herein, Visa U.S.A., Inc. implemented a
bylaw requiring Visa’s 100 largest issuers of debit
cards in the United States to pay a fee if they reduce their
debit volume by more than 10%. If Visa is permitted to enforce
this bylaw, it would penalize Visa members seeking to do debit
business with MasterCard and effectively prevent them from
converting their debit cards to the MasterCard brand. MasterCard
has challenged the validity of this bylaw provision as described
more fully in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. In addition, under the settlement agreement in the
U.S. merchant lawsuit, merchants will have the right to
reject MasterCard-branded debit cards in the United States,
while still accepting other MasterCard-branded cards and vice
versa. Either of these scenarios would be detrimental to
MasterCard’s ability to maintain and grow its debit card
business in the United States.

We establish multilateral interchange fees on
behalf of certain customers. While we do not receive or record
interchange fees as revenue, the impact of the global
interchange proceedings described in Note 16 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included herein could impact
our customers’ use of card programs carrying our brands,
thereby negatively impacting our future revenues.

Results of Operations

Key selected financial and operating data for the
three years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 is
included in the table below. The acquisition of MasterCard
Europe (formerly Europay International S.A. (“EPI”)),
on June 28, 2002, affected the comparability of our
financial data. The results of MasterCard Europe’s
operations have been included in our consolidated statements of
operations from June 28, 2002; however, MasterCard
Europe’s gross dollar volume and transactions are included
in all periods.



**

— Not meaningful

Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar
except for MasterCard Europe, whose functional currency is the
euro, therefore our results of operations have been impacted by
movements of the euro against the U.S. dollar. As the euro
strengthened against the U.S. dollar during the year ended
December 31, 2003, MasterCard Europe’s revenue and
expenses increased as a result of translation into
U.S. dollar amounts. In addition, we assess our members
based on the U.S. dollar volume of their card programs.
Since the U.S. dollar devalued against most major
currencies in 2003, our revenues increased accordingly. However,
it is not practical to estimate the impact of the
U.S. dollar devaluation on our assessment revenue.

Revenues

Our revenues are generated from the fees that we
charge our customers for providing transaction processing and
other payment services, and from assessments calculated on the
dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands. We
establish standards and procedures for the acceptance and
settlement of our customer transactions on a global basis. We do
not issue cards, set fees, or determine the interest rates
consumers will be charged on MasterCard-branded cards. Our
issuing customers have the responsibility for determining these
and most other competitive card features. Our revenues are based
upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or
reported by our customers. Certain revenues are estimated based
upon aggregate transaction information, historical and projected
customer performance.

The U.S. market remains our largest geographic
market. Revenue generated in the U.S. accounted for
approximately 63% and 61% of our total revenue for the years
ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. No other
country accounted for more than 5% of the Company’s revenue
in 2003 and 2002.



Operations Fees

Operations fees primarily represent user fees for
authorization, clearing, settlement and other payment services
that facilitate transaction and information management among our
customers on a global basis. Operations fees increased
$199 million or 16% in 2003 and $149 million or 14% in
2002 from the prior year. The acquisition of MasterCard Europe
accounted for $111 million or 56% and $69 million or
46% of the increase in operations fees in 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The significant changes in operations fees were as
follows:

•

Authorization and settlement revenues increased
    $156 million, or 29%, in 2003 and $118 million, or 27%
    in 2002. These revenues are driven by the number of transactions
    processed through our systems, and the acquisition of MasterCard
    Europe. A portion of settlement revenues is generated from
    foreign currency rate movements in the settlement process. We
    anticipate that the migration of Switch brand in the United
    Kingdom to our Maestro brand will increase the number of
    transactions processed and accordingly, operations fees in 2004.

•

Currency conversion revenues increased
    $30 million in 2003 and $39 million in 2002,
    principally due to the acquisition of MasterCard Europe. These
    revenues are the result of cross border transactions by
    cardholders which require currency conversion to settle
    transactions between issuers and acquirers. These revenues
    fluctuate with cross border travel and are impacted by changes
    in foreign currency exchange rates. While the conflict in Iraq,
    threat of terrorism and outbreak of SARS negatively impacted
    cross border travel in the beginning of 2003, travel increased
    significantly in the latter part of the year. We also benefited
    from favorable currency fluctuations. In 2002, the increase in
    currency conversion revenues was principally due to the recovery
    of the U.S. market from decreased travel and related
    expenditures that resulted in the weeks after the terrorist
    attacks on September 11, 2001.



Our pricing structure rewards customers with
lower prices in exchange for certain volume, share and other
commitments. Core revenue growth rates are affected by the
consolidation of our customers, competition in our industry and
continued organic growth in transactions and volumes. Since we
offer tiered pricing for our services, as our customers merge
and grow they are moving into lower relative pricing for the
same level of services. In addition to the tiered pricing,
incentives and rebates are provided to certain customers.
Incentives and rebates increased $9 million in 2003 and
$13 million in 2002.

Assessments

Assessments are based on our customers’
gross dollar volume (“GDV”) of MasterCard
transactions. GDV represents gross usage (purchase and cash
disbursements) on MasterCard-branded cards for goods and
services including balance transfers and convenience checks. In
2003 and 2002, assessment revenue growth was $140 million,
or 21% and $132 million, or 25%, respectively. The
acquisition of MasterCard Europe accounted for $94 million
or 68% and $75 million or 57% of the increase in assessments in
2003 and 2002, respectively. Excluding MasterCard Europe,
assessment revenues grew 8% in 2003 and 11% in 2002.

GDV growth, including MasterCard Europe, when
measured in local currency was 6% and 16% in 2003 and 2002,
respectively and 10% and 17%, respectively, when measured on a
U.S. dollar converted basis. Moderating the increase in
assessments were rebates and incentives provided to customers,
which increased by $72 million and $53 million in 2003
and 2002, respectively. These rebates and incentives generally
are based on card generated volume as well as a fixed component
for marketing support for the launch of new programs. As volumes
increase, the rebates and incentives also increase.
Additionally, the increase in rebates in 2003 can be attributed
to the addition of new member contracts, particularly in
MasterCard Europe, which adopted the practice of offering
rebates and incentives after the Integration.

Operating Expenses

Our operating expenses are comprised of general
and administrative, advertising and market development, the
U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements, and
depreciation and amortization expenses. In 2003, there was an
increase in operating expenses of $1.1 billion or 62%, of
which $763 million or 44% was a result of the
U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements and
$197 million or 11% was due to the acquisition of
MasterCard Europe. In 2002, there was an increase in operating
expenses of $360 million or 26%, of which $169 million
or 12% was due to the acquisition of MasterCard Europe.



General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of personnel, professional fees, data processing,
telecommunications and travel. In 2003 and 2002, these
activities accounted for approximately 39% and 55% of operating
expenses, respectively. General and administrative expenses
increased $134 million in 2003 and $151 million in
2002, primarily due to increases in personnel expenses. The
acquisition of MasterCard Europe accounted for
$110 million, or 82%, and $78 million, or 52%, of the
increase in general and administrative expenses in 2003 and
2002, respectively.

•

Personnel expenses in 2003 increased due to a
    full year of salaries and benefits as compared to six months in
    2002 as a result of headcount increases from the acquisition of
    MasterCard Europe. In addition:

•

In 2002, the increase in general and
    administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increases
    in personnel costs due to the increase in headcount resulting
    from the acquisition of MasterCard Europe and salary increases.

Advertising and Market
    Development

Advertising and market development consists of
expenses associated with advertising and marketing, and
promotions and sponsorships, which promote our brand and assist
our customers in achieving their goals. In 2003 and 2002, these
activities accounted for approximately 30% and 40% of operating
expenses, respectively. Advertising and market development
expenses increased $157 million or 23% in 2003 and
$188 million or 37% in 2002. The acquisition of MasterCard
Europe accounted for $70 million or 45% and
$73 million or 39% of the increase in advertising and
market development expenses in 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Our advertising and market development expenses
increased as a result of a number of key initiatives in 2003 and
2002. The major advertising and market development activities
increased as follows:

•

Advertising and marketing expenses increased
    $107 million and $114 million in 2003 and 2002,
    respectively. Our Priceless campaign continues to be successful
    and effective in 96 countries and 47 languages; therefore
    we continue to invest significantly in this campaign.

•

Promotions increased $36 million in 2003 and
    $24 million in 2002, respectively. Promotions are run to
    assist our customers in generating sales i) during
    particular times of the year such as the summer or holiday
    seasons ii) for specific payment products such as debit or
    iii) in specific shopping venues.

•

Sponsorships increased $14 million and
    $50 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. MasterCard is a
    sponsor of the World Cup, which culminated in 2002; therefore in
    2002, significant resources were spent on the sponsorship fee,
    special programming, promotions and event marketing. In 2003,
    the increase in sponsorships was offset by a $12 million
    decrease for amounts spent on the World Cup in 2002. During
    2003, we became a sponsor of the UEFA Champions League and
    certain NFL teams. Other significant sponsorships in both years
    include Major League Baseball, the Professional Golf Association
    and Universal Studios.



The MasterCard family of brands, principally
MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus, are valuable strategic assets
which convey a symbol that can be readily identified by our
customers, as well as our customers’ customers, which
create value for our business. Our advertising and marketing
efforts are focused on ensuring that our services are
identified, communicated and marketed in a clear, efficient and
consistent manner, not only on a local level, but also on a
global scale. We are committed to maintaining and enhancing our
brand reputation and image.

In 2002, MasterCard implemented a four-year plan
to accelerate our profitable growth and to enhance the global
position of MasterCard and its customers by significantly
expanding its spending in advertising and market development.
For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, we spent
$152 million and $87 million, respectively, on
advertising and marketing relating to this plan. The primary
focus of these initiatives is to build brand recognition,
promote brand acceptance, and enhance the development of our
programs and services in certain markets. We will continue to
evaluate the extent of these initiatives in light of changing
market conditions.

Merchant Lawsuit and Other Legal
    Settlements

For the year ended December 31, 2003, the
total pre-tax charge recorded for the U.S. merchant lawsuit and
other legal settlements was $763 million. The primary
components of this charge were (i) the monetary amount of
the U.S. merchant settlement (discounted at 8 percent
over the payment term), (ii) certain additional costs in
connection with, and in order to comply with, other requirements
of the U.S. merchant settlement, and (iii) costs to
address certain merchants who opted not to participate in the
U.S. merchant lawsuit. In addition, in 2003, MasterCard
settled contract disputes with certain customers and incurred
additional costs in connection with the conclusion of certain
litigation discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included herein. Certain of these amounts are
estimates. The Company will evaluate these estimates if
circumstances change and, if necessary, make refinements.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased
$29 million in 2003 and $21 million in 2002.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased significantly
between the periods due to the acquisition of MasterCard Europe
as well as additional capitalized computer software. The
acquisition of MasterCard Europe accounted for $17 million
or 59% and $18 million or 86% of the increase in
depreciation and amortization in 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Our business is dependent on the technology that we use to
process transactions. This technology is continuously updated
and improved. Therefore, our investment in capitalized software
and related amortization also continues to increase. In recent
years we have made the following significant changes to our
technology and technology centers which have caused an increase
in our depreciation and amortization:

•

During 2003, our co-processing technology center
    was moved from Lake Success, NY to Kansas City, MO. The cost of
    the new facility and equipment was $36 million.

•

During 2003, we continued to invest in our System
    Enhancement Strategy, an upgrade of all of MasterCard’s
    core systems to improve productivity and lower overall
    processing costs.

•

During 2002 assets were acquired for our new
    Winghaven technology center.

Other Income and Expense

Other income (expense) is comprised
primarily of investment income and interest expense. Investment
income increased $31 million in 2003 and $3 million in
2002. The increase in 2003 is primarily due to the consolidation
of the variable interest entity (see the discussion in
Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included
herein) and appreciation of the market value of our trading
securities portfolio. Interest expense increased
$53 million in 2003 primarily due to $43 million of
imputed interest on the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement
obligation and the consolidation of the variable interest
entity. Interest expense was $10 million in 2002 and 2001.



Income Taxes

The effective income tax (benefit) rate for
the year ended December 31, 2003 was (36.1)% versus an
effective income tax rate of 26.5% for the year ended
December 31, 2002. The 2003 tax benefit is primarily driven
by the merchant lawsuit settlement. The 2002 rate was primarily
attributable to a one-time revaluation of the 2002 MasterCard
Europe deferred tax liabilities due to the reduction in the
Belgium statutory tax rate from 40.2% to 34.0% in December 2002.

The effective tax rate for the year ended
December 31, 2002 decreased to 26.5% from 39.0% for the
year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in the effective
tax rate was attributable to several items, some of which are
not expected to recur. In December 2002, the Belgium statutory
tax rate was reduced from 40.2% to 34.0%. As a result, deferred
income tax liabilities established in connection with the
acquisition of MasterCard Europe were reduced based on the lower
Belgian income tax rate. The effective tax rate was also
decreased by a change in the geographic distribution of pretax
income in the United States from jurisdictions with higher state
tax rates to those with lower rates. Furthermore, we realized
significant foreign tax credits that we were previously unable
to claim. The benefits of these items in lowering the effective
tax rate were partially offset by a one-time increase in state
income tax expense attributable to lower deferred state tax
assets as a result of lower state tax rates.

Change in Accounting
    Principle

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company
changed its method of calculating the market-related value of
plan assets used in determining the expected return-on-asset
component of its annual pension cost. Under the previous method,
80 percent of the gains and losses on plan assets were
deferred and recognized in the calculated market-related value
over the following four years. Under the new method, the
market-related value equals the current fair value of the plan
assets. The new method is considered preferable because annual
pension expense will reflect changes in the market performance
of plan assets on a more timely basis.

On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the
provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) Interpretation No. 46,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”
(“FIN 46”) and consolidated a variable interest
entity on its consolidated balance sheet. The consolidation
resulted in recording a held-to-maturity municipal bond,
long-term debt and minority interest.

Liquidity

We believe our ability to generate cash from our
business to reinvest in our business is one of our fundamental
financial strengths. We need capital resources and liquidity to
fund our global development, to provide for settlement risk, to
finance capital expenditures and any future acquisitions and to
service the payments of principal and interest on our
outstanding debt and the settlement of the U.S. merchant
lawsuit. At December 31, 2003, we had $880 million of
liquid investments with which to manage operations compared to
$841 million at December 31, 2002. We expect that the
cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will
be sufficient to meet our operating, working capital and capital
needs in 2004. In addition, we believe that our resources are
sufficient to fund our initiatives to accelerate our profitable
growth and to enhance the global position of MasterCard in 2004.



**

— Not meaningful

Cash provided by operating activities in 2003 was
generated principally by current period earnings exclusive of
non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization and legal
settlements. We recorded expense of $763 million for legal
settlement costs in 2003, of which related cash payments totaled
$134 million. In 2002, cash provided by operating
activities was principally due to changes in settlement due to
and from members and increases in accounts payable and accrued
expenses as a result of higher advertising spending and our
focus on working capital management.

The utilization of cash by investing activities
in 2003 was primarily due to the purchase of property, plant,
equipment and capitalized software. The primary capital
expenditure was the purchase of a building in Kansas City,
Missouri for a co-processing center. See discussion in
Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included
herein. Our capitalized software is essential to providing
payment card transaction processing to our members through a
proprietary, global computer and telecommunications system. In
2002, our outlay of cash was primarily due to purchases of data
center equipment, capitalized software and investment securities
available-for-sale, offset by $31 million of cash received,
net of acquisition-related expenses, from the acquisition of
MasterCard Europe during the second quarter of 2002.

In 2002 financing activities relate to repayments
of MasterCard’s net settlement overdraft positions. See
Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included
herein.

As discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included herein, we recorded liabilities in
connection with certain legal settlements. We believe that we
will be able to fund amounts payable in connection with these
legal settlements through existing cash and cash equivalents,
investments, cash generated from operations and our borrowing
capacity.

Due to Standard & Poor’s assessment
of MasterCard’s vulnerability to legal risk, on
May 16, 2003, Standard & Poor’s lowered
MasterCard’s counterparty credit rating to A-/ A-2,
subordinated debt rating to BBB+ and placed MasterCard on
negative outlook. We do not believe this rating action will
materially impact our liquidity.

In addition to our liquid investments, we provide
for liquidity through a committed $1.2 billion revolving
credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with certain
financial institutions which expires on June 18, 2004. The
primary purpose of the Credit Facility is to provide liquidity
in the event of one or more settlement failures by MasterCard
members. Interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility is
charged at the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)
plus 28 basis points. An additional 10 basis points would be
applied if the aggregate borrowings exceed 33% of the
commitments. MasterCard agreed to pay a facility fee equal to 7
basis points on the total commitment. MasterCard was in
compliance with the Credit Facility covenants as of
December 31,



2003. There were no borrowings under the Credit
Facility at December 31, 2003. The lenders under the Credit
Facility are members or affiliates of members of MasterCard
International.

Future Obligations

The following table summarizes as of
December 31, 2003, our obligations that are expected to
impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods. We believe we
will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated
from operations and our existing cash balances.

Member Relationships and Related
Parties

We have a diversified member base of
2,600 principal members and 22,300 affiliate members.
Our stockholders are all principal members of MasterCard
International. In the normal course of business, we enter into
transactions with our members and operate a system for
authorizing, clearing and settling payment transactions among
the members of MasterCard International. These members do not
constitute related parties pursuant to Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 57
“Related Party Disclosures”.

Certain of our members generate in excess of five
percent of our revenue. The loss of any of these members could
adversely impact MasterCard’s net income. In addition, as
part of our business initiative to increase our share,
MasterCard, among other efforts, enters into business agreements
with members. These agreements can be terminated in a variety of
circumstances. Under certain circumstances, we may be required
to permit members in the United States that have entered into
agreements with us to terminate those



agreements without penalty as a result of the
current antitrust litigation being brought against us by the
U.S. Department of Justice. Any termination of these agreements
could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.
However, we believe that it is not currently possible to
estimate the impact, if any, that the termination of any member
business agreements would have on our results of operations,
financial position or cash flows.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our accounting policies are integral to
understanding the results of operations and financial condition.
We are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting periods. We have established
detailed policies and control procedures to ensure the methods
used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and
applied consistently from period to period. The following is a
brief description of our current accounting policies involving
significant management judgments.

Revenue Recognition

The Company’s revenue is comprised
principally of operations fees and assessments. Generally
revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by
our systems or self-reported by our customers. Certain revenues
are estimated based upon aggregate transaction information,
historical and projected customer performance.

We have business agreements with certain
customers that provide for fee rebates when the customers meet
certain hurdles. Such rebates are generally calculated on a
monthly basis based upon the estimated customers’
performance and the contracted discount rates for the services
provided, and are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same
period as the revenue is earned.

In addition, we enter into agreements with
certain customers to provide volume-based and support incentives
that are recorded as a reduction of revenue in accordance with
Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue
No. 01-9, “Accounting for Consideration Given by a
Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s
Products)”. Incentives are based on management’s
estimate of the customer’s performance in a given period.

Our estimate of customers’ performance is a
critical component in the calculation of rebates and incentives.
Rebates and incentives are calculated based upon estimates of
customer performance and the terms in the related customer
agreements. Customers’ performance is estimated by using
historical performance, member reported information, discussions
with our customers and transactional information accumulated
from our systems. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Legal and Regulatory Matters

We are party to legal and regulatory proceedings
with respect to a variety of matters. Except as described in
Notes 3 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included herein, MasterCard does not believe that any legal or
regulatory proceedings to which it is a party would have a
material adverse impact on its business or prospects. We
evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of the legal
or regulatory proceedings to which we are party in accordance
with SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”
(“SFAS No. 5”). Our judgments are subjective
based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the
merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and
outside legal counsel.

We accrued legal costs that are expected to be
incurred to defend MasterCard relating to certain litigation in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 5. The accrual was estimated based
upon management’s expectations of foreseeable costs as
determined in consultation with outside counsel. Changes in the
estimated amount of accrued legal costs can significantly impact
our results of operations.

Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal
and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we
operate, our judgments may not reflect the actual outcomes.



Discount Rate for Merchant Lawsuit
    Settlement

We estimated the discount rate we used to
calculate the present value of our obligations under the
Settlement Agreement to be 8%. The discount rate used was a
matter of management judgment at the time of the settlement,
which considered our expected post-settlement credit rating and
rates for sources of credit that could be used to finance the
payment of such obligations with similar terms.

A 1% increase in the discount rate would decrease
the amount we recorded as an after-tax charge for the year ended
December 31, 2003 by approximately $20 million, and
increase annual interest expense by approximately
$4.2 million, $4.0 million, and $3.8 million in
2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively, and declining amounts
thereafter. The reverse impact would be experienced for a 1%
decrease in the discount rate.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of cost over net
assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of certain
businesses. In accordance with SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002
we stopped amortizing goodwill. Prior to January 1, 2002,
goodwill was amortized, under the straight-line method over the
related useful life of 20 years.

Principally all of our goodwill relates to the
Integration of MasterCard Europe. On an annual basis, we will
evaluate whether an impairment of the goodwill may exist.
Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two-step approach. The
first step is to identify a potential impairment and the second
step measures the amount of the impairment loss, if any.
Impairment is measured as the excess of carrying amount over
fair value.

In conducting our impairment analyses, we
utilized independent valuation experts to perform the analyses
and tests of our goodwill. The test methods employed involved
assumptions concerning interest and discount rates, growth
projections and other assumptions of future business conditions.
The assumptions employed were based on management’s
judgment using internal and external data. Based on our testing,
we concluded that goodwill was not impaired.

Other Intangible Assets

Other intangible assets consist of capitalized
software costs, franchise rights, trademarks, tradenames and
other intangible assets, which have finite lives, and customer
relationships, which have indefinite lives. Intangible assets
with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives under
the straight-line method.

SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”) requires
intangible assets with finite lives to be reviewed for
impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their
carrying amount may not be recoverable. The primary component of
our definite lived assets is our capitalized software. Our
capitalized software, which includes internal and external costs
incurred in developing or obtaining computer software for
internal use, is included in other intangible assets in the
consolidated balance sheets in accordance with Statement of
Position 98-1, “Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use” and
related guidance. Development costs are expensed during the
preliminary project management phase until it is probable that
the project will be completed and the software will be used to
perform the function intended. Thereafter, all qualifying direct
internal and external costs related to the design, development
and testing phase are capitalized, and upon the project being
substantially complete and ready for its intended use, are
amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful life of the software, not to exceed three years. Costs
related to post-implementation activities for software that is
developed or obtained for internal use are expensed as incurred.

We are required to make judgments to determine if
each project will satisfy its intended use and the phase of each
project. In addition, we estimate the average internal costs
incurred for payroll and payroll related expenses by department
for the employees who directly devote time relating to the
design, development and testing phases of the project. These
judgments and estimates impact the accounting for capitalized
software in our consolidated financial statements. During the
year, we discontinued the use of various technologies and as
such, we performed an impairment analysis on the related
technologies and



concluded that the carrying value of these assets
was in excess of fair value. Fair value was estimated as zero
due to discontinued future use and an impairment charge was
recorded.

SFAS 142 also requires intangible assets
with indefinite lives to be tested for impairment at least
annually. We consider our customer relationships to be an
indefinite lived intangible asset and, as such, test for
impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate
potential impairment. We utilized independent valuation experts
to assist us in determining the fair value of our customer
relationships during 2003. Based on our testing, we concluded
that our customer relationships were not impaired.

Pensions

Certain assumptions are used in the determination
of our annual pension costs and the disclosure of the funded
position of our pension plans. Key assumptions include the
discount rate used to measure the plans’ projected benefit
obligation and the expected rate of return on plan assets. We
utilized a discount rate of 6.25 percent in measuring the
pension projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2003,
6.75 percent in calculating the 2003 expense and an
expected return on plan assets of 8.5 percent. A quarter of
a percentage point decrease in our discount rate would increase
our projected benefit obligation by $2 million, and would
increase our annual pension expense by $0.3 million. An
equal but opposite effect would be experienced for a quarter of
a percentage point increase in the discount rate. A quarter of a
percentage point increase or decrease in the expected rate of
return on plan assets would decrease or increase the annual
pension costs by $0.3 million.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on
Issue No. 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables” (“EITF 00-21”).
EITF 00-21 addresses how to determine when a revenue
arrangement for multiple deliverables should be divided into
separate units of accounting and, if separation is appropriate,
how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to the
identified accounting units. The provisions of EITF 00-21 are
effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal
periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company may
enter into contracts with its customers that provide for free or
discounted services that are required to be separately
identified under EITF 00-21. The discount from the fair
value of the services is recorded as a reduction of revenue
related to other elements of the contract. The Company adopted
EITF 00-21 on July 1, 2003 and the impact of adopting
this accounting pronouncement was negligible.

In January 2003, FIN 46 was issued and in
December 2003, FIN 46 was revised. FIN 46 clarifies
that companies may need to consolidate certain entities in which
equity investors do not have the characteristics of a
controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity
at risk for the entity to finance its activities without
additional subordinated financial support from other parties.
FIN 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities created
or in which an enterprise obtains an interest after
January 31, 2003. The Company adopted FIN 46 on
January 1, 2003. The impact of consolidating the variable
interest entity is discussed in detail in Note 13 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. The revised
provisions of FIN 46 will be effective in the first quarter
of 2004. Our adoption of the revisions to FIN 46 is not expected
to have a material impact on our financial position or results
of operations.

In December 2003, the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
(“SAB”) No. 104, “Revenue Recognition”
(“SAB 104”), which supercedes SAB No. 101,
“Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements”
(“SAB 101”). The primary purpose of SAB 104
is to rescind accounting guidance contained in SAB 101
related to multiple element revenue arrangements, superceded as
a result of the issuance of EITF 00-21. Additionally,
SAB 104 rescinds the SEC’s “Revenue Recognition
in Financial Statements Frequently Asked Questions and
Answers” (“the FAQ”) issued with SAB 101
that had been codified in SEC Topic 13, “Revenue
Recognition”. Selected portions of the FAQ have been
incorporated into SAB 104. The adoption of SAB 104 did
not have an impact on the Company’s financial position or
results of operations.

In December 2003, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 132 (revised 2003), “Employers’ Disclosures
about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, an amendment
of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106, and a



revision of FASB Statement No. 132”
(“FAS 132”). This Statement revises
employers’ disclosures about pension plans and other
postretirement benefit plans. It does not change the measurement
or recognition of those plans required by FASB Statements
No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for
Pensions”, No. 88, “Employers’ Accounting
for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension
Plans and for Termination Benefits”, and No. 106,
“Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions”. SFAS 132 requires additional
disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows, and net
periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other
postretirement benefit plans. The Company has adopted those
aspects of SFAS 132 which are required for fiscal year
ended 2003 and will fully implement the revised standard in
fiscal year ending 2004.

In January 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff
Position No. FAS 106, “Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003”
(“FSP 106-1”). FSP 106-1 permits employers
that sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide
prescription drug benefits to retirees to make a one-time
election to defer accounting for any effects of the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003
(the “Act”). Without FSP 106-1, plan sponsors
would be required under SFAS No. 106, “Employers’
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions”, to account for the effects of the Act in the
fiscal period that includes December 8, 2003, the date the
President of the United States signed the Act into law. If
deferral is elected, the deferral must remain in effect until
the earlier of (a) the issuance of guidance by the FASB on
how to account for the federal subsidy to be provided to plan
sponsors under the Act or (b) the remeasurement of plan
assets and obligations subsequent to January 31, 2004.
MasterCard made the one-time election to defer accounting for
any effects of the Act until guidance is issued by FASB and will
determine the impact, if any, that the Act will have on the
financial position and results of operations of the Company.

In November 2003, the EITF reached a partial
consensus on EITF Issue No. 03-01, “The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
Investments,” (“EITF 03-01”).
EITF 03-01 addresses determining the meaning of
other-than-temporary impairment and its application to
investments classified as either available-for-sale or
held-to-maturity under SFAS 115, “Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities”
(“SFAS 115”), and investments accounted for under
the cost method or the equity method. Although the EITF
requested further revisions to the underlying impairment models,
the EITF reached a consensus that certain quantitative and
qualitative disclosures should be required for debt and
marketable equity securities classified as available-for-sale or
held-to-maturity under SFAS 115 that are below cost at the
balance sheet date but for which an other-than-temporary
impairment has not been recognized. The consensus on
quantitative and qualitative disclosures is effective for fiscal
years ending after December 15, 2003. The Company adopted
the disclosure provisions of EITF 03-01 for fiscal year
ended 2003.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market risk is the potential for economic losses
to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from
adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates,
foreign currency exchange rates, and equity price risk. We have
limited exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates,
foreign exchange rates and equity price risk. Management
establishes and oversees the implementation of policies, which
have been approved by the Board of Directors, governing our
funding, investments, and use of derivative financial
instruments. We monitor aggregate risk exposures on an ongoing
basis. There have been no material changes in our market risk
exposures at December 31, 2003 as compared to
December 31, 2002.

Foreign Exchange Risk

We enter into forward exchange contracts to
minimize risk associated with anticipated receipts and
disbursements denominated in foreign currencies. We also enter
into contracts to offset possible changes in value due to
foreign exchange fluctuations of assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies. The objective of this
activity is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and
losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against
the U.S. dollar and euro. The terms of the forward currency
contracts are generally less than 18 months.



At December 31, 2003 and December 31,
2002, forward currency contracts against the U.S. dollar were
both purchased (with notional amounts of $64 million and
$39 million, respectively) and sold (with notional amounts
of $60 million and $25 million, respectively). Based on the
year-end 2003 and 2002 foreign exchange positions, the effect of
a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar
is estimated to create a loss valued at $0.4 million and
$1.3 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

At December 31, 2003 and December 31,
2002, forward currency contracts against the euro were both
purchased (with notional amounts of $178 million and
$199 million, respectively) and sold (with notional amounts
of $8 million at December 31, 2002). There were no
forward currency contracts sold against the euro at
December 31, 2003. Based on the year-end 2003 and 2002
foreign exchange positions, the effect of a hypothetical
10 percent strengthening of the euro is estimated to create
a loss valued at $16 million and $17 million at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Our settlement activities may be subject to
foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate
fluctuations. This risk is limited to the extent that the
timeframe between setting the foreign exchange rates and
clearing the financial transactions is typically one business
day and by limiting the supported settlement currencies to USD
or one of seventeen other stable transaction currencies. The
remaining 144 transaction currencies are settled in one of the
supported settlement currencies or require local settlement
netting arrangements that minimize our foreign exchange exposure.

Interest Rate Risk

Our interest sensitive assets are our debt
instruments, which we hold as available-for-sale investments.
They are rated AA or above and primarily consist of fixed rate
short and medium-term notes. With respect to fixed maturities,
our general policy is to invest in high quality securities,
while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining
diversification to avoid significant exposure. Based on the net
present value of expected future cash flows, a 100 basis point
increase in interest rates, assuming a parallel shift of the
yield curve, would result in fair value changes and an
unrealized loss recorded in other comprehensive income of
$17 million and $15 million for 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Our held-to-maturity investments are considered
non-trading securities and would not be subject to interest rate
movements.

Our interest rate sensitive liabilities consist
of subordinated debt securities. A 100 basis point decrease in
rates would result in a fair value loss of $12 million and
$13 million for December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included herein.

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, we had
various credit facilities to provide liquidity in the event of
material member settlement failures, settlement service
operations and other operational needs. These credit facilities
have variable rates, which are applied to the borrowing based on
terms and conditions set forth in each agreement. There were no
amounts outstanding at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively under these credit facilities. See Note 12 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.

Equity Price Risk

We own trading securities, which are comprised of
equity securities selected to offset obligations in connection
with an executive compensation plan. The effect of a
hypothetical 10 percent decline in market value would
result in a loss of $3 million for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002. Since these securities are part
of a deferred executive compensation plan and to the extent the
plan remains in a net appreciation position; an offsetting gain
would be recorded in general and administrative expense.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

MasterCard Incorporated:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of
operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in
stockholders’/ members’ equity, and cash flows present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
MasterCard Incorporated and its subsidiaries at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2003 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company’s management; our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 10 to the financial
statements, the Company changed its method for calculating the
market-related value of plan assets used in determining the
expected return on the assets component of annual pension cost.
Additionally, as discussed in Note 13 to the financial
statements, the Company adopted the provisions of Financial
Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”, which
resulted in the consolidation of a special purpose entity.

Note 1.

Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

Organization

—
MasterCard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries,
including MasterCard International (“MasterCard
International”) and MasterCard Europe sprl
(“MasterCard Europe”) (together,
“MasterCard” or the “Company”), provide
transaction processing and related services to customers
principally in support of their credit, deposit access (debit),
electronic cash, Automated Teller Machine (“ATM”)
payment card programs, and travelers cheque programs. MasterCard
enters into transactions with its customers in the normal course
of business and operates a system for payment processing among
its customers.

Consolidation and basis of
presentation

— The Company
follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Certain prior period amounts have been
reclassified to conform to 2003 classifications. The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
MasterCard and its majority-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany
transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

The Company consolidates majority-owned or
controlled entities; including specific consideration of
variable interest entities which are required to be consolidated
in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 46,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”
(“FIN 46”). Minority interest is recorded for
consolidated entities in which the Company owns less than 100%
of the interest. Minority interest represents the equity
interest not owned by the Company.

The Company accounts for investments in entities
under the equity method of accounting when it holds between 20%
and 50% ownership in the entity and when it exercises
significant influence. The equity method of accounting is also
utilized for limited partnerships and limited liability
companies if the investment ownership percentage is greater than
3% of outstanding ownership interests or common stock,
respectively, regardless of whether MasterCard has significant
influence over the investees. MasterCard’s share of net
earnings of entities accounted for under the equity method of
accounting is included in other income (expense) on the
consolidated statements of operations.

The Company accounts for investments in
affiliates under the historical cost method of accounting when
it holds less than 20% ownership in the entity and when it does
not exercise significant influence.

Investments in entities for which the equity
method and historical cost method of accounting is appropriate
are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

Use of
estimates

— The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that effect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting periods. Management has established
detailed policies and control procedures to ensure the methods
used to make estimates are well controlled and applied
consistently from period to period. Actual results may differ
from these estimates.

Cash and cash
equivalents

— Cash and cash
equivalents include certain highly liquid investments with a
maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase. Cash
equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.

Investment
securities

— The Company
classifies debt securities as held-to-maturity or
available-for-sale and classifies equity securities as trading.

Debt securities are classified as
held-to-maturity when the Company has the positive intent and
ability to hold the debt securities to maturity.
Held-to-maturity debt securities are stated at amortized cost.
Debt securities that are not held-to-maturity are classified as
available-for-sale. Available-for-sale debt securities



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share
data)

are carried at fair value, with the unrealized
gains and losses, net of applicable taxes, recorded as a
separate component of other comprehensive income on the
consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Quoted
market values, when available, are used to determine the fair
value of debt securities. The specific identification method is
used to determine realized gains and losses. Net realized gains
and losses on debt securities are recognized in investment
income on the consolidated statements of operations.

Equity securities bought and held primarily for
sale in the near term are classified as trading and are reported
at fair value. Quoted market values are used to determine the
fair value of trading securities. The Company’s trading
securities are publicly traded and are related to an executive
compensation plan. Net realized and unrealized gains and losses
on trading securities are recognized in investment income on the
consolidated statements of operations. The specific
identification method is used to determine realized gains and
losses. To the extent these securities have appreciated over
their original cost, a corresponding offset is recorded in
general and administrative expense in connection with the
executive compensation plan.

Held-to-maturity and available-for-sale
investments are evaluated for other than temporary impairment on
an ongoing basis in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 115,
“Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities”. In addition, MasterCard assesses whether any
investment securities were in continuous gross unrealized loss
positions for greater than twelve months, in accordance with
Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue
No. 03-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments.”

Settlement due to/due from
members

— The Company
operates systems for clearing and settling payment transactions
among MasterCard International members. Net settlements are
generally cleared daily among members through settlement cash
accounts by wire transfer or other bank clearing means. However,
some transactions may not settle until subsequent business days,
resulting in amounts due from and due to MasterCard
International members.

Restricted security deposits held for
MasterCard International
members

— MasterCard
requires and holds cash deposits from certain members of
MasterCard International in order to maintain collateral for
settlement of their transactions. These assets are fully offset
by corresponding liabilities included in the consolidated
balance sheets.

Property, plant and
equipment

— Property, plant
and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Depreciation of equipment and furniture and
fixtures is computed using the straight-line method over the
related estimated useful lives of the assets, generally ranging
from two to five years. Amortization of leasehold improvements
is computed using the straight-line method, over the lesser of
the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the terms of
the related leases. Capital leases are amortized using the
straight-line method, over the lives of the leases. Depreciation
on buildings is calculated using the straight-line method over
an estimated useful life of 30 years. Amortization of
leasehold improvements and capital leases is included in
depreciation expense.

The Company evaluates the recoverability of all
long-lived assets, except goodwill and indefinite lived assets,
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their
carrying amount may not be recoverable as required under SFAS
No. 144 “Accounting for Impairment or Disposal for
Long-Lived Assets”. If the carrying value of the asset
cannot be recovered from estimated future cash flows,
undiscounted and without interest, the fair value of the asset
is calculated using the present value of estimated net future
cash flows. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair
value a loss is recorded.

Goodwill

—
Goodwill represents the excess of cost over net assets acquired
in connection with the acquisition of certain businesses.
Beginning January 1, 2002, in accordance with SFAS
No. 142, “Goodwill



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share
data)

and Other Intangible Assets”
(“SFAS 142”), goodwill amortization ceased. Prior
to January 1, 2002, goodwill was amortized, using the
straight-line method over an estimated useful life of
20 years.

In accordance with SFAS 142, goodwill is
required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Goodwill
was tested for impairment during 2003 and 2002 and no impairment
charge resulted. SFAS 142 also requires that transitional
goodwill (goodwill recorded prior to the adoption of
SFAS 142) be tested for impairment within six months of the
adoption of SFAS 142. Accordingly, MasterCard tested its
existing goodwill (see Note 8), prior to the acquisition of
MasterCard Europe, which was recorded in connection with the
acquisition of certain businesses, and no impairment was
required.

Intangible
assets

— Intangible assets
consist of capitalized software costs, franchise rights,
trademarks, tradenames and other intangible assets, which have
finite lives, and customer relationships, which have indefinite
lives. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized
over their estimated useful lives under the straight-line method.

Capitalized software, which includes internal and
external costs incurred in developing or obtaining computer
software for internal use, is capitalized in other intangible
assets on the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with
Statement of Position 98-1, “Accounting for the Costs
of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal
Use” and related guidance. Development costs are expensed
during the preliminary project management phase until it is
probable that the project will be completed and the software
will be used to perform the function intended. Thereafter, all
qualifying direct internal and external costs related to the
design, development and testing phase are capitalized, and upon
the project being substantially complete and ready for its
intended use, are amortized using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful life of the software, not to exceed three
years. Costs related to post-implementation activities for
software that is developed or purchased for internal use are
expensed as incurred. In determining whether to capitalize
software or impair previously capitalized software, MasterCard
makes judgments to determine if each project will satisfy its
intended use and the phase of each project. The average internal
costs incurred for payroll and payroll related expenses by
department for the employees who directly devote time relating
to the design, development and testing phases of the project are
estimated.

SFAS 142 requires intangible assets with
finite lives to be reviewed for impairment when events or
changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may
not be recoverable. During 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded
an impairment charge for finite lived intangible assets. This
impairment charge is discussed in Note 9. In addition,
SFAS 142 requires intangible assets with indefinite lives
to be tested for impairment at least annually. Customer
relationships were tested for impairment during 2003 and 2002
and no impairment charge resulted.

Litigation
accrual

— The Company is
party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a
variety of matters. Except as described in Notes 3
and 16, MasterCard does not believe that any legal or
regulatory proceedings to which it is a party would have a
material adverse impact on its business or prospects. We
evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of the legal
or regulatory proceedings to which we are party in accordance
with SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for
Contingencies” (“SFAS No. 5”). Our judgments
are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory
proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with
in-house and outside legal counsel.

Settlement and travelers cheque
risk

— MasterCard has global
risk management policies and procedures, which include risk
standards to provide a framework for managing the Company’s
settlement exposure. Settlement risk is the legal exposure due
to the difference in timing between the payment transaction date
and subsequent settlement. MasterCard International’s rules
generally guarantee the payment of MasterCard transactions and
certain Cirrus and Maestro transactions between principal
members. In the event that MasterCard International effects a
payment on behalf of a failed member, MasterCard International
may seek



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share
data)

an assignment of the underlying receivables.
Subject to approval by the Board of Directors, members may be
assessed for the amount of any settlement loss. MasterCard has
also guaranteed the payment of MasterCard-branded travelers
cheques in the event of issuer default. The term and amount of
these guarantees are unlimited.

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company
adopted the accounting recognition and measurement provisions of
FASB Interpretation No. 45 “Guarantors Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (“FIN 45”).
FIN 45 requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the
entity (guarantor) must recognize a liability for the fair
value of the obligation it assumes. The accounting recognition
and measurement provisions of this pronouncement are effective
for guarantees that are issued or modified after
December 31, 2002.

Derivative financial
instruments

— The Company
accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with
SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 133”).
SFAS 133, as amended and interpreted, establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. SFAS 133 requires
that all derivatives, whether designated in hedging
relationships or not, be recorded on the balance sheet at fair
value in other assets and other liabilities, regardless of the
purpose or intent for holding them.

Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is
highly effective and that is designated and qualifies as a
foreign-currency cash flow hedge are recorded in other
comprehensive income until earnings are affected by the
variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction (e.g., until
periodic settlements of a variable-rate asset or liability are
recorded in earnings). Any hedge ineffectiveness (which
represents the amount by which the changes in the fair value of
the derivative exceeds the variability in the cash flows of the
forecasted transaction) is recorded in current-period earnings.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments which are
foreign currency fair value hedges or which do not qualify for
hedge accounting or when not designated as hedge accounting
under SFAS 133 are reported in current-period earnings.

The Company formally documents all relationships
between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its
risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various
hedge transactions for all derivatives which qualify for hedge
accounting under SFAS 133. This process includes linking
all derivatives that are designated as foreign-currency cash
flow hedges to forecasted transactions. The Company also
formally assesses (both at the hedge’s inception and on an
ongoing basis) whether the derivatives that are used in hedging
transactions have been highly effective in offsetting changes in
the fair value or cash flows of hedged items and whether those
derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future
periods. If and when it is determined that a derivative is no
longer expected to be highly effective hedge accounting is
discontinued.

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 149,
“Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 149”).
SFAS 149 improves financial reporting by requiring that
contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for
similarly. The provisions of SFAS 149 are effective for
contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. The
impact of adopting this accounting pronouncement was negligible.

Income
taxes

— The Company provides
for income taxes under the provisions of SFAS No. 109
“Accounting for Income Taxes”
(“SFAS 109”). SFAS 109 requires an asset and
liability based approach in accounting for income taxes.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future years of
temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts and income tax bases of assets and liabilities.
Valuation allowances are provided against assets which are not
likely to be realized.



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share
data)

Revenue
recognition

— The
Company’s revenue is comprised principally of operations
fees and assessments. Revenues are generally based upon
transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported
by our customers. Certain revenues are estimated based upon
aggregate transaction information, historical and projected
customer performance.

The Company adopted EITF Issue No. 00-21,
“Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables”,
(“EITF 00-21”), for revenue arrangements entered
into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003.
EITF 00-21 addresses how to determine when a revenue
arrangement for multiple deliverables should be divided into
separate units of accounting and, if separation is appropriate,
how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to the
identified accounting units. The Company has entered into
contracts with its customers that provide for free or discounted
services that are required to be separately identified under
EITF 00-21. The discount from the fair value of the
services is recorded as a reduction of revenue related to other
elements of the contract using the residual method as allowed
under the provisions of EITF 00-21. The impact of adopting
this accounting pronouncement was negligible for the year ended
December 31, 2003.

Operations fees represent fees for authorization,
clearing, settlement and other products and services that
facilitate transaction and information management among the
Company’s customers on a global basis. These fees are
recognized as revenue in the same period as the related
transactions occur or services are rendered. Operations fees
also include net foreign exchange gains on settlement activities
and excessive chargeback violation fees which are recognized
when assessed against acquirers and collectibility is reasonably
assured. Other revenues included within operations fees include
sales of holograms, paper warning bulletins, manuals and
publications. Revenues from these sales are recognized when
persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred or services have been rendered, the seller’s price
to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is
reasonably assured. Also included are consulting revenues which
are generated by the MasterCard Advisors group and are
recognized as revenue as services are rendered either on the
percentage of completion or completed contract method, depending
on the nature of the consulting arrangement.

Assessments predominantly represent payments made
by members of MasterCard International with respect to their
card programs carrying the marks of one or more of the brands
within the MasterCard family of brands, principally the
MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus brands. Assessments are based
principally upon daily, monthly or quarterly gross dollar
volumes (“GDV”), which represent gross usage (purchase
and cash disbursements) on MasterCard-branded cards for goods
and services, including balance transfers and convenience
checks. Assessments are recorded as revenue in the period they
are earned, which is when the related GDV is generated on the
cards. Assessments are based on management’s estimate of
the customers’ performance in a given period and actual
results may differ from these estimates.

MasterCard has business agreements with certain
customers that provide for fee rebates when the customers meet
certain hurdles. Such rebates are calculated on a monthly basis
based upon estimated performance and the contracted discount
rates for the services provided. MasterCard also enters into
agreements with certain customers to provide volume-based and
support incentives. Rebates and incentives are recorded as a
reduction of revenue in the same period as the revenue is earned
in accordance with EITF Issue No. 01-9, “Accounting
for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a
Reseller of the Vendor’s Products)”
(“EITF 01-9”). Rebates and incentives are based
on management’s estimate of the customers’ performance
in a given period, and actual results may differ from these
estimates.

Pension and other postretirement
plans

— The compensation
cost of an employee’s pension benefit is recognized on the
projected unit credit method over the employee’s
approximate service period. The unit credit cost method is
utilized for funding purposes. Prior to 2003, the expected
return on plan assets was based on a calculated asset value.
Beginning in 2003, the expected return on plan assets is based
on the current fair value of the plan assets; this change in
accounting principle is discussed in Note 10.



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share
data)

In December 2003, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 132 (revised 2003), “Employers’ Disclosures
about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, an amendment
of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106, and a revision
of FASB Statement No. 132”
(“SFAS 132”). This Statement revises
employers’ disclosures about pension plans and other
postretirement benefit plans. It does not change the measurement
or recognition of those plans required by FASB Statements
No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for
Pensions”, No. 88, “Employers’ Accounting
for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension
Plans and for Termination Benefits”, and No. 106,
“Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions”. SFAS 132 requires additional
disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows, and net
periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other
postretirement benefit plans. The Company has adopted those
aspects of SFAS 132 which are required for fiscal year
ended 2003 and will fully implement the revised standard in
fiscal year ending 2004.

In January 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff
Position No. FAS 106, “Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003”
(“FSP 106-1”). FSP 106-1 permits employers
that sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide
prescription drug benefits to retirees to make a one-time
election to defer accounting for any effects of the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003
(the “Act”). Without FSP 106-1, plan sponsors
would be required under SFAS No. 106, “Employers”
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions”, to account for the effects of the Act in the
fiscal period that includes December 8, 2003, the date the
President of the United States signed the Act into law. If
deferral is elected, the deferral must remain in effect until
the earlier of (a) the issuance of guidance by the FASB on
how to account for the federal subsidy to be provided to plan
sponsors under the Act or (b) the remeasurement of plan

MasterCard made the one-time election to defer accounting for
any effects of the Act in fiscal 2003 and will determine the
impact, if any, that the Act will have on the financial position
and results of operations of the Company.

Advertising
expense

— Cost of media
advertising is generally expensed when the advertising takes
place. Production costs are expensed as costs are incurred.
Promotional items are expensed at the time the promotional event
occurs.

Foreign currency
translation

— The
U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the majority of
the Company’s businesses except for MasterCard
Europe’s operations for which the functional currency is
the euro. Where the U.S. dollar is considered the
functional currency, monetary assets and liabilities are
remeasured to U.S. dollars using current exchange rates in
effect at the balance sheet date; non-monetary assets and
liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates; and
revenue and expense accounts are remeasured at a weighted
average exchange rate for the period. Resulting exchange gains
and losses are included in net income (loss). For MasterCard
Europe, translation from the euro to U.S. dollars is
performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange
rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and
expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate for the
period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a
component of other comprehensive income (loss).

Net income (loss) per
share

— MasterCard computes
basic and diluted net income (loss) per share by dividing
net income (loss) applicable to common stock by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the
period.

Note 3.     U.S. Merchant
Lawsuit and Other Legal Settlements

During 2003, MasterCard settled the U.S. merchant
lawsuit described in Note 16 herein and contract disputes
with certain customers. MasterCard International signed a
Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with plaintiffs in
the U.S. merchant lawsuit on April 30, 2003. On
June 4, 2003, MasterCard and plaintiffs signed a settlement
agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) embodying the
terms originally set forth in the MOU. The Settlement Agreement
requires the Company to pay $125,000 in 2003 and $100,000
annually from 2004 through 2012. In addition, the Company is
required to adopt rules which will permit U.S. merchants to
elect not to accept MasterCard branded debit or credit cards,
implement programs to allow merchants to identify debit cards,
provide signage to merchants and establish a separate debit
interchange rate. For a description of interchange, see the text
under the heading “Global Interchange Proceedings” in
Note 16.

In addition, as described in Note 16,
several lawsuits have been commenced by merchants who have opted
not to participate in the plaintiff class in the
U.S. merchant lawsuit. On December 31, 2003,
MasterCard entered into an agreement to settle claims of one of
these lawsuits. The “opt out” merchant lawsuits are
not covered by the terms of the Settlement Agreement.

For the year ended December 31, 2003 , the
total pre-tax charge recorded for the U.S. merchant lawsuit
and other legal settlements was $763,460. The primary component
of this charge was made in connection with the signing of the
MOU, for which MasterCard recorded a pre-tax charge of $721,000
($469,000 after-tax) in the three month period ended
March 31, 2003, consisting of (i) the monetary amount
of the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement (discounted at
8 percent over the payment term), (ii) certain
additional costs in connection with, and in order to comply
with, other requirements of the U.S. merchant lawsuit
settlement, and (iii) costs to address the merchants who
opted not to participate in the plaintiff class in the
U.S. merchant lawsuit. This amount was an estimate, which
was revised during the three months ended December 31, 2003
based on approval of the settlement agreement by the court, and
other factors. The Company will continue to review these
estimates and, if necessary, future refinements will be made. In
addition, MasterCard settled contract

disputes with certain customers and incurred
costs in connection with the conclusion of certain litigation
discussed in Note 16, which resulted in the recording of
additional charges during 2003. These charges are included in
the total amount of legal settlements in 2003 set forth above.
Relating to these settlements, cash payments of $133,680 were
made in the year ended December 31, 2003. Additionally,
$42,686 of imputed interest on the U.S. merchant lawsuit was
included in interest expense in the year ended December 31,
2003.

Conversion to a Stock Company and Acquisition
    of Europay International (“EPI”)

Conversion

On June 28, 2002, pursuant to an Agreement
and Plan of Merger dated as of February 13, 2002,
MasterCard International merged with a subsidiary of MasterCard
Incorporated (the “Conversion”). In the Conversion,
each principal member of MasterCard International received
shares of class A redeemable common stock and class B
convertible common stock of MasterCard Incorporated,
representing that member’s equity interest in the Company.
Additionally, each principal member of MasterCard International
received a class A membership interest in MasterCard
International, representing that member’s continued rights
as a licensee to use MasterCard’s brands, programs,
products and services. MasterCard Incorporated owns the sole
class B membership interest in MasterCard International,
entitling MasterCard Incorporated to exercise all economic
rights and substantially all voting rights in MasterCard
International. MasterCard International is the Company’s
principal operating subsidiary.

In connection with the Conversion, MasterCard
acquired, directly and indirectly, 100% of the shares of EPI not
previously owned by MasterCard International pursuant to a Share
Exchange and Integration Agreement, dated as of
February 13, 2002, entered into by MasterCard, MasterCard
International and EPI (the “Integration Agreement”).
EPI, now MasterCard Europe, is the Company’s principal
operating subsidiary in Europe.



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share

The authorized capital stock of MasterCard
consists of 275,000 shares of class A redeemable common stock,
par value $.01 per share (of which 84,000 shares are issued and
outstanding); 25,000 shares of class B convertible common stock,
par value $.01 per share (of which 16,000 shares are issued and
outstanding); and 75,000 shares of class C common stock, par
value $.01 per share (of which no shares are issued or
outstanding).

If a stockholder of MasterCard Incorporated
ceases to be a principal member of MasterCard International
before July 1, 2005, the common stock will be redeemed at
par value. After July 1, 2005, MasterCard may, at its
option, redeem the common stock of a stockholder that ceases to
be a principal member of MasterCard International for the book
value of the shares, based on MasterCard’s financial
statements most recently filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

If MasterCard does not redeem the
stockholder’s shares, a stockholder ceasing to be a member
of MasterCard International after July 1, 2005 will be
required to offer the unredeemed shares to the other
stockholders of MasterCard Incorporated in accordance with
procedures to be established by the board of directors.

Under the terms of the Integration Agreement,
class B convertible common stock will automatically be
converted into class A redeemable common stock on or about
July 1, 2005, except for certain class B shares
attributable to the ec Pictogram brand in Europe
(“ec Picto shares”). In accordance with the
Integration Agreement, the class A shares will then be
reallocated among the stockholders of MasterCard Incorporated on
that date. The ec Picto shares will automatically be
converted into class A shares and reallocated on or about
July 1, 2007, in accordance with the terms of the
Integration Agreement.

Class C common stock may be issued from time
to time with voting powers, designations, preferences and other
rights to be determined by the MasterCard board of directors, in
compliance with certain limitations, set forth in the
certificate of incorporation of MasterCard Incorporated.

Transfer of shares of common stock and assignment
of the right to receive shares is not permitted, except under
specific circumstances, until July 1, 2005. After
July 1, 2005, each stockholder must maintain an ownership
percentage of common stock that is no less than 75% and no more
than 125% of the most recent global proxy calculation, which is
the formula set forth in the Company’s bylaws to determine
the allocation of shares to stockholders based on their business
contributions to the Company. Stockholders may be required to
purchase or sell shares of MasterCard in order to satisfy these
requirements.

Acquisition of EPI
(“Integration”)

In connection with the Integration Agreement,
each shareholder of EPI (other than MasterCard International and
MasterCard Europay U.K. Limited (“MEPUK”))
entered into a separate share exchange agreement pursuant to
which it exchanged its EPI shares for shares of class A
redeemable and class B convertible common stock of
MasterCard Incorporated. In addition, the shareholders of MEPUK
entered into an agreement pursuant to which they exchanged their
MEPUK shares for class A and class B shares of
MasterCard Incorporated. As a result of the Integration, EPI and
MEPUK became wholly-owned subsidiaries of MasterCard
Incorporated. MEPUK’s sole asset is shares of EPI (now
MasterCard Europe).

MasterCard Europe’s primary business is to
license a full range of payment programs and services to
financial institutions in the European region and to provide a
set of information processing and transaction delivery services
to these institutions. The Integration has allowed MasterCard
International and MasterCard Europe to form an integrated,
global payments company with a single management team and
governance structure that is able to address customer needs.



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share
data)

The results of EPI’s operations have been
included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company
from June 28, 2002.

Purchase Price for EPI

MasterCard Incorporated issued 23,760 shares
to the shareholders of EPI and MEPUK in the Integration, in
return for directly and indirectly acquiring 100% of the shares
of EPI not previously owned by MasterCard International.
However, of the 23,760 shares issued, only 17,610 were
considered to be issued unconditionally. As discussed more fully
below, the purchase price for EPI was based on the estimated
value of the unconditional shares only, and this estimated value
was determined on the basis of an independent valuation.
Considering this valuation and the 17,610 unconditional shares
issued, the purchase price of EPI was $267,856, excluding
estimated acquisition costs of $10,486 that were incurred by the
Company.

In calculating the purchase price of EPI, the
Company considered only the unconditional shares issued to the
former shareholders of EPI and MEPUK because the Integration
Agreement provides that the number of shares allocated to these
shareholders will potentially increase or decrease at the end of
a three-year transition period as a result of the application of
a global proxy formula for the third year of the transition
period. Of the 23,760 shares attributable to the exchange
of EPI and MEPUK shares, 6,150 shares are conditional
shares subject to reallocation at the end of the transition
period. EPI and MEPUK shareholders therefore received 17,610
unconditional shares at closing.

Since former EPI and MEPUK shareholders would
retain or receive additional shares of MasterCard Incorporated
at the end of the transition period without remitting any
additional consideration, any shares retained or received by
them that are above their minimum allocation at that time would
constitute a part of the purchase price. Any such additional
shares would be valued at that time based upon the fair value of
the stock of MasterCard Incorporated. Any such reallocation of
shares to former EPI and MEPUK shareholders will increase the
purchase price for EPI and, accordingly, the amount of goodwill
and additional paid-in capital recorded.

Fair Value of EPI Assets Acquired and
Liabilities Assumed

The following table summarizes the estimated fair
values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at
June 28, 2002, the date of the acquisition of EPI in the
Integration, as determined based on an independent appraisal,
and also reflects subsequent refinements to the estimated fair
values through June 30, 2003 as discussed below. Certain
balances for assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been
reclassified to conform to MasterCard presentation for
consistency:



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share

Subsequent to the acquisition date of EPI, the
purchase price allocation was refined and amounts were
reallocated among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
The table above has been adjusted to reflect these refinements;
which include an $8,171 increase to the exit cost liability
estimate, a $5,178 decrease to the deferred tax estimate, a
$4,911 decrease to the value assigned to certain
capitalized software technologies and a $7,903 increase to
goodwill. Changes to the exit cost liability through
June 30, 2003 are discussed below and the changes to
goodwill are provided in Note 8.

Pursuant to the Integration Agreement, the bylaws
of MasterCard International adopted on June 28, 2002
provide that the Company will assume the first $7,000 of losses
or liabilities that relate to any breach of EPI’s
representations or warranties in the Integration Agreement; any
such losses or liabilities in excess of $7,000 could, under
MasterCard International’s bylaws, be levied against
MasterCard International’s European members as an
assessment. MasterCard anticipates that certain former
EPI liabilities could trigger this bylaw provision. The
$7,000 is included in total liabilities assumed above.

Exit Costs Relating to the
Integration

Included in the total liabilities assumed above
are estimates of exit costs relating to the Integration. The
changes in the liability for exit costs are summarized as
follows:

During the years ended December 31, 2003 and
2002, the Company adjusted its preliminary estimate of exit
costs related to the Integration. In 2003 the estimate of exit
costs was increased by $6,199 due to the identification of an
additional redundant system and incremental costs which were not
included in the preliminary estimate. In 2002, the estimate was
adjusted by $2,583 to reflect external consulting services
relating to the redundant computer systems. The workforce
reduction liability was decreased by $69 and $542 in the years
ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, due to the
redeployment of certain employees. These changes in estimate
resulted in a corresponding net increase in goodwill, net of
taxes. No further changes to the exit cost liability are
anticipated.

plant and equipment was $52,953, $42,068 and $43,015 for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

In January 2003, MasterCard purchased a building
in Kansas City, Missouri for approximately $23,572. The
building is a co-processing data center which replaced the
back-up data center in Lake Success, New York. During
2003, MasterCard entered into agreements with the City of
Kansas City for (i) the sale-leaseback of the building
and related equipment which totaled $36,382 and (ii) the
purchase of municipal bonds for the same amount which have been
classified as municipal bonds held-to-maturity. The agreements
enabled MasterCard to secure state and local financial benefits.
No gain or loss was recorded in connection with the agreements.
The leaseback has been accounted for as a capital lease as the
agreement contains a

bargain purchase option at the end of the
ten-year lease term on April 1, 2013. The building and
related equipment are being depreciated over their estimated
economic life in accordance with the Company’s policy. Rent
of $1,819 is due annually and is equal to the interest due on
the municipal bonds. The future minimum lease payments are
$54,371 and are included in the future commitment schedule in
Note 14. A portion of the building was subleased to the
original building owner for a five-year term with a renewal
option. As of December 31, 2003, the future minimum
sublease rental income is $3,668.

Note
8.     Goodwill

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill
for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 are as
follows (see Note 5):

In 2003, the Company increased its preliminary
estimate of exit costs by $3,792 net of tax, primarily due to
the identification of an additional redundant system and
incremental costs which were not included in the preliminary
estimate. In 2002, changes in the estimate of exit costs
relating to the Integration were $1,221, net of tax. The exit
costs relating to redundant computer systems/technology were
increased to reflect external consulting services in excess of
the preliminary estimate and exit costs relating to the
workforce reduction liability were decreased due to the
redeployment of certain employees. The purchase price allocation
for certain capitalized software technologies was refined in
2002 after the values of the assets were finalized, which
resulted in a $2,890 increase to goodwill, net of tax.

The following table sets forth the impact of the
adoption of SFAS 142 on the Company’s earnings:

Other Intangible Assets

The following table sets forth net intangible
assets, other than goodwill:

Additions to capitalized software primarily
relate to internal projects associated with system enhancements
or infrastructure improvements. Both capitalized software and
trademarks include assets which are denominated in foreign
currency; as such a component of the increase in these
intangible assets is attributable to foreign currency
translation.

In connection with the acquisition of EPI on
June 28, 2002 the Company assumed customer relationships.
During 2003 these customer relationships increased by $30,333
solely due to foreign currency translation.

Amortization and impairment expense on the assets
above amounted to the following:

During the years 2003, 2002 and 2001, impairment
charges of $3,371, $6,370 and $891, respectively, were taken
primarily in connection with decisions to discontinue the use of
various technologies. The Company performed an impairment
analysis on the related technology licenses and concluded that
the carrying value of these assets was in excess of fair value.
Fair value was estimated as zero due to discontinued future use
of the underlying technology. Impairment charges were recorded
in general and administrative expense on the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations for each of the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.

During 2001, the Company evaluated the
recoverability of certain franchise rights and recorded
impairment charges of $3,224. Government restrictions and slower
than expected development in certain countries limited future
cash streams in the foreseeable future. As a result, the Company
adjusted the carrying value of franchise rights associated with
its consolidated subsidiaries Mondex Asia, Mondex China and
Mondex India to the estimated net present value of future cash
flows from those entities. On December 20, 2001, Mondex
Asia sold franchise rights with a carrying value of $1,100 for
$1,100. At December 31, 2001, the entire remaining balance
of shareholder franchise rights had been fully amortized,

Pension, Savings Plan and Other
    Benefits

The Company maintains a noncontributory defined
benefit pension plan with a cash balance feature covering
substantially all of its U.S. employees. This pension plan
credits participants annually with an amount equal to a
percentage of eligible pay based on age and service, as well as
providing earnings credits based on each participant’s
account balance. Additionally, the company has an unfunded
nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plan that
provides certain key employees with supplemental retirement
benefits in excess of limits imposed on qualified plans by
federal tax laws.

On July 31, 2003, the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Illinois (the “District
Court”) ruled that the formula used in the International
Business Machines Corporation’s (“IBM”) cash
balance pension plan violated the age discrimination provisions
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The
District Court’s decision, however, conflicts with
decisions from two other district courts as well as the Internal
Revenue Service’s proposed regulations for cash balance
plans. Our cash balance formula does not meet the criteria used
by the District Court to reach its decision against IBM. Any
effect of the District Court’s decision in regard to our
qualified pension plan cannot be determined at this time.

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company
changed its method of calculating the market-related value of
plan assets used in determining the expected return on asset
component of its annual pension cost. Under the previous method,
80 percent of the gains and losses on plan assets were
deferred and recognized in the calculated market-related value
over the following four years. Under the new method, the
market-related value equals the current fair value of the plan
assets. The new method is considered preferable because annual
pension expense will reflect changes in the market performance
of plan assets on a timelier basis.

The cumulative effect of this change in
accounting principle related to periods prior to 2003 is a
benefit to earnings for the year ended December 31, 2003,
in the amount of $7,768, less income taxes of $2,819, for a net
benefit of $4,949. The company’s net periodic pension cost
would have been reduced by $1,928 for 2003 if it had not changed
its valuation method. Applying the new methodology retroactively
to January 1, 2002 would have had a negligible impact on
net income and net income per share for the years ended
December 31, 2002 and 2001.

In 2001, the Company eliminated the early
retirement supplement under the cash balance plan, which
provided supplemental monthly benefits provided that certain
criteria were met.

On June 28, 2002, in connection with its
acquisition of MasterCard Europe, the Company assumed a defined
benefit plan (“European Plan”) covering substantially
all employees affiliated with MasterCard Europe. On
December 31, 2002, the Company settled the benefit
obligations and terminated the European Plan. All excess assets
are being transferred to a new defined contribution plan.

2003, 2002, and 2001.

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine
net periodic pension cost (benefit) for years ended
December 31:

The expected return on plan assets is primarily
based on long-term historical returns in equity and fixed income
markets. Based on estimated returns of 10 percent on equity
investments and 6 percent on fixed income investments and
the portfolio targeted asset allocation, the weighted average
expected return of the qualified pension plan assets is
8.5 percent.



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share

The Company’s qualified pension plan’s
weighted-average asset allocations at December 31, 2003 and
2002 by asset category were as follows:

Plan assets are managed with a long-term
perspective to ensure that there is an adequate level of assets
to support benefit payments to participants over the life of the
qualified plan. Plan assets are managed within the asset
allocation ranges above, toward targets of 40% large cap U.S.
equity, 15% small cap U.S. equity, 15% non-U.S. equity and 30%
fixed income, with periodic rebalancing to maintain plan assets
within the asset allocation range. Plan assets are managed by
external investment managers. Investment manager performance is
measured against benchmarks for each asset class and peer group
on quarterly, one-, three- and five-year periods. An independent
consultant assists management with investment manager selections
and performance evaluations. Approximately 8% and 12% of plan
assets at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, which
are classified as fixed income, are invested in cash equivalents
supporting obligations to purchase fixed income securities at
future dates. The other category includes cash that is available
to meet expected benefit payments and expenses.

The funded status of the qualified plan exceeds
minimum funding requirements. The Company does not expect to
make any significant contributions to its pension plans in 2004.

The majority of the Company’s
U.S. employees are eligible to participate in a savings and
profit sharing plan sponsored by the Company. Participants can
invest contributions among several fund alternatives. Effective
January 1, 2003, the Company amended its former savings
plan to incorporate a new profit sharing component. The new plan
retains most of the characteristics of the former plan. The
former plan allowed employees to contribute a portion of their
base compensation on a pre-tax and after-tax basis in accordance
with specified guidelines. The new plan allows employees to
continue to contribute a portion of their base compensation on a
pre-tax and after-tax basis. In addition to matching a
percentage of employee contributions, the Company may contribute
a discretionary profit sharing component linked to its
performance each year. The Company has several defined
contribution plans outside of the United States. The
Company’s contribution aggregated $31,349, $24,285 and
$19,905 for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The Company has a Value Appreciation Program
(“VAP”), which is a frozen incentive plan established
in 1995. Annual awards were granted to VAP participants from
1995 through 1998, which entitled participants to the net
appreciation on a portfolio of securities of MasterCard members.
In 1999, the VAP was replaced by an Executive Incentive Plan
(“EIP”). Although contributions to the VAP have been
discontinued, plan assets remain and participants are entitled
to the net appreciation on the portfolio of securities in
accordance with plan provisions. The Company’s liability
related to the VAP at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $9,589 and
$5,026 respectively, and the expense/(income) was $8,497,
($3,854) and ($6,114) for the years ending December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

MasterCard’s EIP is a performance unit plan,
in which participants receive grants of units with a target
value contingent on the achievement of the Company’s
long-term performance goals. Employees who are designated Senior
Vice President or higher are eligible for participation in any
performance period, provided they have met certain performance
criteria. The Compensation Committee and/or the President and
Chief Executive Officer may also designate other employees as
eligible to participate in the plan.

The final value of the units under the EIP is
calculated based on the Company’s performance over a
three-year period. The performance units vest over three- and
five-year periods. Awards are paid in the form of cash over a
five-year vesting period. Upon completion of the three-year
performance period, participants receive a payment equal to
80 percent of the award earned. The remaining
20 percent of the award is paid upon completion of two
additional years of service. The Company’s liability
related to EIP at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002
was $79,179 and $85,551 respectively, and the expense was
$27,764, $36,545 and $31,536 for the years ending
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Both the VAP and the EIP are accounted for in
accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 28,
“Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other
Variable Stock Option or Award Plans” (“FIN 28”).
In accordance with FIN 28, compensation is accrued as a charge
to expense over the periods the employee performs the related
services.

Note 11.

Postretirement Health and Life Insurance
    Benefits

The Company maintains a postretirement plan
providing health coverage and life insurance benefits for
substantially all of its U.S. employees and retirees.

In 2001, MasterCard modified certain provisions
of its postretirement plan based on certain business objectives.
The new plan is better aligned with the Company’s qualified
pension plan by providing annual contributions for medical
benefits based upon employee service. The life insurance
benefits under the plan remained unchanged. The new program does
not alter benefits applicable to grandfathered participants.

On December 8, 2003, the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003
(the “Act”) became effective. The Act introduces a
prescription drug benefit under Medicare as well as providing a
federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans
that provide prescription drug benefits. The Company has elected
to make a one-time election to defer accounting for the effects
of the Act until guidance is issued by the FASB as allowed by
FASB Staff Position No. FAS 106-1. The Company’s
disclosures regarding the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligations and net periodic postretirement benefit cost do not
reflect the effects of the Act. Since specific authoritative
guidance on the accounting of the Act is pending, the
Company’s cost and financial disclosures could change and
require amending previously reported information.

Debt

On June 20, 2003, the Company entered into a
$1,200,000 revolving credit facility (the “Credit
Facility”) with certain financial institutions which
expires on June 18, 2004. The purpose of the Credit
Facility is to provide liquidity in the event of one or more
settlement failures by MasterCard members. The Credit Facility
replaced MasterCard Incorporated’s prior $1,200,000 credit
facility, which expired on June 3, 2003. The lenders under
the prior facility had agreed to extend its term through
July 3, 2003. Interest on borrowings under the Credit
Facility is charged at the London Interbank Offered Rate
(“LIBOR”) plus 28 basis points. An additional 10
basis points would be applied if the aggregate borrowings exceed
33% of the commitments. MasterCard agreed to pay a facility fee
equal to 7 basis points on the total commitment under the
Credit Facility. The Company also agreed to pay upfront fees of
$556 and administrative fees of $255 for the Credit Facility,
which are being amortized straight-line over one year. Facility
and other fees associated with the Credit Facility or prior
facilities totaled $1,742, $1,636 and $1,513 for each of the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. MasterCard
was in compliance with the Credit Facility covenants as of
December 31, 2003 and was in compliance with the covenants
for the previous facility at December 31, 2002. There were
no borrowings under the Credit Facility at December 31,
2003 or the previous facility at December 31, 2002. The
lenders under the Credit Facility are members or affiliates of
members of MasterCard International.

On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the
provisions of FIN 46, as discussed in Note 13. As a
result of the consolidation of the variable interest entity,
$149,380 in long-term debt was recorded on the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet.

In June 1998, MasterCard International issued
ten-year unsecured, subordinated notes (the “Notes”)
paying a fixed interest rate of 6.67% per annum. The terms of
the Notes require MasterCard to repay the principal amount on
June 30, 2008. The Company has the option to prepay the
principal amount of the Notes at anytime prior to the repayment
date, however an additional “make-whole” amount must
also be calculated and paid to investors at that time. The
“make whole” amount represents the discounted value of
the remaining principal and interest. The interest on the Notes
was $5,336 for each of the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001. The Company was in compliance with the covenants
of the Notes as of December 31, 2003 and 2002. The
principal amount of the Notes outstanding at December 31,
2003 and 2002 was $80,000. The fair value of the Notes was
estimated at $88,440 and $88,581 at December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively.

MasterCard Europe and European Payment System

requirements. There were no borrowings under this
facility at December 31, 2003; however at December 31,
2003, the facility supported 12 bank-issued guarantees for a
total of 742 euros, which reduced the amount of funds available
under the facility. For bank guarantees, a guarantee fee is paid
at a rate of 1.5% per annum.

MasterCard Europe has two additional uncommitted
credit agreements totaling 130,000 euros. There were no
borrowings under these agreements at December 31, 2003.

Note 13.

Consolidation of Variable Interest
    Entity

On August 31, 1999, MasterCard International
entered into a ten-year synthetic lease agreement for a global
technology and operations center located in O’Fallon,
Missouri, called Winghaven. The lessor under the lease agreement
is MasterCard International O’Fallon 1999 Trust (the
“Trust”). The variable interest entity
(“VIE”) was established for a single discrete purpose,
is not an operating entity, has a limited life and has no
employees. The Trust financed the operations center through a
combination of a third party equity investment and the issuance
of 7.36 percent Series A Senior Secured Notes (the
“Secured Notes”) in the amount of $149,380 due
September 1, 2009.

Annual rent of $11,390 is payable by MasterCard
International and is equal to interest payments on the Secured
Notes and a return to equity-holders. The future minimum lease
payments are $68,342 and are included in the future commitment
schedule in Note 14. In conjunction with the lease agreement,
MasterCard International executed a guarantee of
85.15 percent of the Secured Notes outstanding totaling
$127,197 at December 31, 2003. Additionally, upon the
occurrence of specific events of default, MasterCard
International guarantees repayment of the total outstanding
principal and interest on the Secured Notes and would take
ownership of the facility.

The lease agreement permits MasterCard
International to purchase the facility upon 180 days notice
at a purchase price equal to the aggregate outstanding principal
amount of the Secured Notes, including any accrued and unpaid
interest and investor equity, along with any accrued and unpaid
amounts due to the investor under the lease agreement after
August 31, 2006.

On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the
provisions of FIN 46 and consolidated the Trust on the
Company’s consolidated balance sheet, which resulted in
recording $154,000 in municipal bonds held by the Trust,
$149,380 in long-term debt and $4,620 of minority interest
relating to the equity in the Trust held by a third party. The
redemption value of the minority interest approximates its
carrying value and will be redeemed by the minority interest
holders upon the maturity of the Secured Notes. For the year
ended December 31, 2003, the consolidation had no impact on net
loss. However, interest income and interest expense were each
increased by $11,390 for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Commitments and Contingent
    Liabilities

The future minimum payments under non-cancelable
operating leases for office buildings and equipment,
sponsorships, licensing and other agreements at
December 31, 2003 are as follows:

Included in the table above are capital leases
with imputed interest expense of $18,741 and a net present value
of minimum lease payments of $50,267. In addition, at
December 31, 2003, $16,106 of the future minimum payments
in the table above for operating leases, sponsorship, licensing
and other agreements was accrued. Consolidated rental expense
for the Company’s office space was approximately $28,298,
$25,651 and $21,412 for the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively. Consolidated lease expense for
automobiles, computer equipment and office equipment was $9,019,
$5,061 and $2,537 for the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively.

MasterCard licenses certain software to its
customers. The license agreements contain guarantees under which
the Company indemnifies licensees from any adverse judgments
arising from claims of intellectual property infringement by
third parties. The terms of the guarantees are equal to the
terms of the license to which they relate. The amount of the
guarantees are limited to damages, losses, costs, expenses or
other liabilities incurred by the licensee as a result of any
intellectual property rights claims. The Company does not
generate significant revenues from software licensing. The fair
value of the guarantees is estimated to be negligible.

Income Tax

The total income tax provision (benefit) for
the years ended December 31 is comprised of the following
components:

The domestic and foreign components of earnings
(losses) before income taxes for the years ended
December 31, are as follows:

MasterCard has not provided for U.S. federal
income and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $4,000 of
undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2003 because such earnings are intended to be
reinvested indefinitely outside of the United States. If these
earnings were distributed, foreign tax credits may become
available under current law to reduce or eliminate the resulting
U.S. income tax liability.

The provision (benefit) for income taxes
differs from the amount of income tax (benefit) determined
by applying the appropriate statutory U.S. federal income tax
rate to pretax income (loss) for the years ended
December 31, as a result of the following:

The effective income tax (benefit) rate for
the year ended December 31, 2003 was (36.1)% versus an
effective income tax rate of 26.5% for the year ended
December 31, 2002. The 2003 tax benefit is primarily



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share
data)

driven by the merchant lawsuit settlement. The
2002 rate was primarily attributable to a one-time revaluation
of the 2002 MasterCard Europe deferred tax liabilities due to
the reduction in the Belgium statutory tax rate from 40.2% to
34.0% in December 2002.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the
expected future tax consequences of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and
liabilities. The net deferred tax asset at December 31 is
comprised of the following:

The current portion of the net deferred tax asset
is included in other current assets on the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet.

The valuation allowance relates to the
Company’s ability to recognize tax benefits associated with
carry-forward capital losses and carry-forward losses for state
income tax purposes. The valuation allowance was $593 at
December 31, 2001. The valuation allowance increased in
years in which losses and capital losses were incurred but tax
benefits could not be recognized and decreased in years in which
losses were recognized.

If not utilized, the carry-forwards will expire
in 2006 and 2007. The carry-forward foreign operating losses
have no expiration date.

Note 16.

Legal Proceedings

MasterCard is a party to legal proceedings with
respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of
business. Except as described below, MasterCard does not believe
that any legal proceedings to which it is a party would have a
material impact on its results of operations, financial
position, or cash flows.

Department of Justice Antitrust
Litigation

In October 1998, the United States Department of
Justice (“DOJ”) filed suit against MasterCard
International, Visa U.S.A., Inc. and Visa International Corp. in
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York
alleging that both MasterCard’s and Visa’s governance
structure and policies violated U.S. federal antitrust laws.
First, the DOJ claimed that “dual
governance” — the situation where a financial
institution has a representative on the board of directors of
MasterCard or Visa while a portion of its card



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share
data)

portfolio is issued under the brand of the other
association — was anti-competitive and acted to limit
innovation within the payment card industry. At the same time,
the DOJ conceded that “dual issuance” — a
term describing the structure of the bank card industry in the
United States in which a single financial institution can issue
both MasterCard and Visa-branded cards — was
pro-competitive. Second, the DOJ challenged MasterCard’s
Competitive Programs Policy (“CPP”) and a Visa bylaw
provision that prohibit financial institutions participating in
the respective associations from issuing competing proprietary
payment cards (such as American Express or Discover). The DOJ
alleged that MasterCard’s CPP and Visa’s bylaw
provision acted to restrain competition.

MasterCard denied the DOJ’s allegations.
MasterCard believes that both “dual governance” and
the CPP are pro-competitive and fully consistent with U.S.
federal antitrust law.

A bench trial concerning the DOJ’s
allegations was concluded on August 22, 2000. On
October 9, 2001, the District Court judge issued an opinion
upholding the legality and pro-competitive nature of dual
governance. In so doing, the judge specifically found that
MasterCard and Visa have competed vigorously over the years,
that prices to consumers have dropped dramatically, and that
MasterCard has fostered rapid innovations in systems, product
offerings and services.

However, the judge also held that
MasterCard’s CPP and the Visa bylaw constitute unlawful
restraints of trade under the federal antitrust laws. The judge
found that the CPP and Visa bylaw weakened competition and
harmed consumers by preventing competing proprietary payment
card networks such as American Express and Discover from
entering into agreements with banks to issue cards on their
networks. In reaching this decision, the judge found that two
distinct markets — a credit and charge card issuing
market and a network services market — existed in the
United States, and that both MasterCard and Visa had market
power in the network market. MasterCard strongly disputes these
findings and believes that the DOJ failed, among other things,
to demonstrate that U.S. consumers have been harmed by the CPP.

On November 26, 2001, the judge issued a
final judgment that orders MasterCard to repeal the CPP insofar
as it applies to issuers and enjoins MasterCard from enacting or
enforcing any bylaw, rule, policy or practice that prohibits its
issuers from issuing general purpose credit or debit cards in
the United States on any other general purpose card network. The
judge also concluded that during the period in which the CPP was
in effect, MasterCard was able to “lock up” certain
members by entering into long-term agreements with them pursuant
to which the members committed to maintain a certain percentage
of their general purpose card volume, new card issuance or total
number of cards in force in the United States on
MasterCard’s network. Accordingly, the final judgment
provides that there will be a period (commencing on the
effective date of the judgment and ending on the later of two
years from that date or two years from the resolution of any
final appeal) during which MasterCard will be required to permit
any issuer with which it entered into such an agreement prior to
the effective date of the final judgment to terminate that
agreement without penalty, provided that the reason for the
termination is to permit the issuer to enter into an agreement
with American Express or Discover. MasterCard would be free to
apply to the District Court to recover funds paid but not yet
earned under any terminated agreement. The final judgment
imposes parallel requirements on Visa. The judge explicitly
provided that MasterCard and Visa would be free to enter into
new partnership or member business agreements in the future.

MasterCard appealed the judge’s ruling with
respect to the CPP and on February 6, 2002, the judge
issued an order granting MasterCard’s and Visa’s
motion to stay the final judgment pending appeal. On
September 17, 2003 a three-judge panel of the Second
Circuit issued its decision upholding the District Court’s
decision. On January 9, 2004, the Second Circuit denied
MasterCard’s petition for a rehearing en banc.
MasterCard’s time in which to file a petition for
certiorari with the Supreme Court is currently running. The
District Court’s final judgment remains stayed pending
MasterCard’s petition for a writ of certiorari to the
Supreme Court.



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share
data)

In addition, on September 18, 2003,
MasterCard filed a motion before the District Court judge in
this case seeking to enjoin Visa, pending completion of the
appellate process, from enforcing a newly-enacted bylaw
requiring Visa’s 100 largest issuers of debit cards in the
United States to pay a so called “settlement service”
fee if they reduce their Visa debit volume by more than 10%.
This bylaw was later modified to clarify that the settlement
service fee would only be imposed if an issuer shifted its
portfolio of debit cards to MasterCard. Visa implemented this
bylaw provision following the settlement of the U.S. merchant
lawsuit described under the heading “U.S. Merchant Opt Out
and Consumer Litigations” below. MasterCard believes that
this bylaw is punitive and inconsistent with the status quo that
the District Court judge in the DOJ case sought to preserve in
her decision to stay her final judgment pending appeal, and
would be inconsistent with the final judgment if it is preserved
on appeal. On December 8, 2003, the District Court judge
ruled that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to issue an
injunction, but held that the court would have the authority to
rescind contracts entered into by issuers with Visa because of
the settlement service fee if the court’s final judgment is
upheld on appeal and the court finds that the settlement service
fee violates the final judgment. At this time it is not possible
to determine the ultimate resolution of this matter.
Consequently, no provision for losses is necessary at this time
with respect to this litigation.

Currency Conversion Litigations

MasterCard International, together with Visa
U.S.A., Inc. and Visa International Corp., are defendants in a
state court lawsuit in California. The lawsuit alleges that
MasterCard and Visa wrongfully imposed an asserted one percent
currency conversion “fee” on every credit card
transaction by U.S. MasterCard and Visa cardholders involving
the purchase of goods or services in a foreign country, and that
such alleged “fee” is unlawful. This action, titled
Schwartz v. Visa Int’l Corp., et al., was brought in
the Superior Court of California in February 2000, purportedly
on behalf of the general public. Trial of the Schwartz matter
commenced on May 20, 2002 and concluded on
November 27, 2002. The Schwartz action claims that the
alleged “fee” grossly exceeds any costs the defendants
might incur in connection with currency conversions relating to
credit card purchase transactions made in foreign countries and
is not properly disclosed to cardholders. Plaintiffs seek to
prevent defendants from continuing to engage in, use or employ
the alleged practice of charging and collecting the asserted one
percent currency conversion “fee” and from charging
any type of purported currency conversion “fee”
without providing a clear, obvious and comprehensive notice that
a fee will be charged. Plaintiffs also request an order
(1) requiring defendants to fund a corrective advertising
campaign; and (2) awarding restitution of the monies
allegedly wrongfully acquired by imposing the purported currency
conversion “fee”. MasterCard denies these allegations.

On April 8, 2003, the trial court judge
issued a final decision in the Schwartz matter. In his decision,
the trial judge found that MasterCard’s currency conversion
process does not violate the Truth In Lending Act or
regulations, nor is it unconscionably priced under California
law. However, the judge found that the practice is deceptive
under California state law, and ordered that MasterCard mandate
that members disclose the currency conversion process to
cardholders in cardholder agreements, applications,
solicitations and monthly billing statements. As to MasterCard,
the judge also ordered unspecified restitution to California
cardholders. The judge issued a decision on restitution on
September 19, 2003, which requires a traditional notice and
claims process in which consumers have approximately six months
to submit their claims. MasterCard cannot determine the outcome
of the restitution process at this time. The court issued its
final judgment on October 31, 2003. On December 29,
2003, MasterCard filed a notice of appeal and, with respect to
restitution, believes it is likely to prevail on such appeal. On
January 20, 2004, plaintiffs filed an application for an
award of attorneys’ fees and reimbursement of expenses.

In addition, MasterCard has been served with
complaints in state courts in New York, Arizona, Texas, Florida,
Arkansas, Kentucky, Illinois and Tennessee seeking to, in
effect, extend the judge’s decision in the Schwartz matter
to MasterCard cardholders outside of California. Some of these
cases have been transferred

to the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York and combined with the federal complaints in
MDL No. 1409 discussed below. In other state court cases,
MasterCard has moved to dismiss the claims. On December 12,
2003, the action in Kentucky was dismissed; however, plaintiff
in that case has moved for a rehearing.

MasterCard International, Visa U.S.A., Inc., Visa
International Corp., several member banks including Citibank
(South Dakota), N.A., Citibank (Nevada), N.A., Chase Manhattan
Bank USA, N.A., Bank of America, N.A. (USA), MBNA, and Diners
Club are also defendants in a number of federal putative class
actions that allege, among other things, violations of federal
antitrust laws based on the asserted one percent currency
conversion “fee”.

Pursuant to an order of the Judicial Panel on
Multidistrict Litigation, the federal complaints have been
consolidated in MDL No. 1409 before Judge William H.
Pauley III in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York. In January 2002, the federal plaintiffs
filed a Consolidated Amended Complaint (“MDL
Complaint”) adding MBNA Corporation and MBNA America Bank,
N.A. as defendants. This pleading asserts two theories of
antitrust conspiracy under Section 1 of the Sherman Act,
15 U.S.C. §1: (i) an alleged
“inter-association” conspiracy among MasterCard
(together with its members), Visa (together with its members)
and Diners Club to fix currency conversion “fees”
allegedly charged to cardholders of “no less than 1% of the
transaction amount and frequently more;” and (ii) two
alleged “intra-association” conspiracies, whereby each
of Visa and MasterCard is claimed separately to have conspired
with its members to fix currency conversion “fees”
allegedly charged to cardholders of “no less than 1% of the
transaction amount” and “to facilitate and encourage
institution — and collection — of second
tier currency conversion surcharges.” The MDL Complaint
also asserts that the alleged currency conversion
“fees” have not been disclosed as required by the
Truth In Lending Act and Regulation Z.

Defendants have moved to dismiss the MDL
Complaint. On July 3, 2003, Judge Pauley issued a decision
granting MasterCard’s motion to dismiss in part. Judge
Pauley dismissed the Truth in Lending claims in their entirety
as against MasterCard, Visa and several of the member bank
defendants. Judge Pauley did not dismiss the antitrust claims.
Discovery in this matter is expected to continue. On
November 12, 2003 plaintiffs filed a motion for class
certification. Oral argument on the motion is currently
scheduled for May 7, 2004. A trial date has been set for
October 10, 2005. At this time, it is not possible to
determine the ultimate resolution of this matter.

For the reasons set forth above, no provision for
losses has been provided in connection with these currency
conversion litigations.

Merchant Chargeback-Related
Litigations

On May 12, 2003, a complaint alleging
violations of federal and state antitrust laws, breach of
contract, fraud and other theories was filed in the U.S.
District Court for the Central District of California (Los
Angeles) against MasterCard by a merchant aggregator whose
customers include businesses selling adult entertainment content
over the Internet. MasterCard has assessed the plaintiff’s
merchant bank (acquirer) for exceeding excessive chargeback
standards in connection with the plaintiff’s transaction
activity. Prior to MasterCard filing any motion or responsive
pleading, the plaintiff filed a voluntary notice of dismissal
without prejudice on December 5, 2003. On the same date,
the plaintiff filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for
the Eastern District of New York making similar allegations to
those made in its initial California complaint. On
January 28, 2004, MasterCard requested a pre-motion
conference with the court in the New York to discuss its
intention to file a motion to dismiss the complaint.

In addition, on June 6, 2003, an action
titled California Law Institute v. Visa U.S.A, et al.
was initiated against MasterCard and Visa U.S.A., Inc. in the
Superior Court of California, purportedly on behalf of the



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

general public. Plaintiffs seek disgorgement,
restitution and injunctive relief for unlawful and unfair
business practices in violation of California Unfair Trade
Practices Act Section 17200, et. seq. Plaintiffs
purportedly allege that MasterCard’s (and Visa’s)
chargeback fees are unfair and punitive in nature. Plaintiffs
seek injunctive relief preventing MasterCard from continuing to
engage in its chargeback practices and requiring MasterCard to
provide restitution and/or disgorgement for monies improperly
obtained by virtue of them. On August 13, 2003, MasterCard
made motions seeking to dismiss the complaint in its entirety
or, in the alternative, to narrow the scope of the proceeding
and add necessary parties. Oral argument on the motions was held
on October 27, 2003. The Court denied the motions. Initial,
but limited, discovery is now proceeding in this matter.

At this time it is not possible to determine the
outcome of the merchant chargeback-related litigations.
Consequently, no provision for losses is necessary at this time
with respect to these litigations.

U.S. Merchant Opt Out and Consumer
Litigations

Commencing in October 1996, several class action
suits were brought by a number of U.S. merchants against
MasterCard International and Visa U.S.A., Inc. challenging
certain aspects of the payment card industry under U.S. federal
antitrust law. Those suits were later consolidated in the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The
plaintiffs challenged MasterCard’s “Honor All
Cards” rule (and a similar Visa rule), which requires
merchants who accept MasterCard cards to accept for payment
every validly presented MasterCard card. Plaintiffs claimed that
MasterCard and Visa unlawfully tied acceptance of debit cards to
acceptance of credit cards. In essence, the merchants desired
the ability to reject off-line, signature-based debit
transactions (for example, MasterCard card transactions) in
favor of other payment forms including on-line, PIN-based debit
transactions (for example, Maestro or regional ATM network
transactions) which generally impose lower transaction costs for
merchants. The plaintiffs also claimed that MasterCard and Visa
conspired to monopolize what they characterized as the
point-of-sale debit card market, thereby suppressing the growth
of regional networks such as ATM payment systems. Plaintiffs
alleged that the plaintiff class had been forced to pay
unlawfully high prices for debit and credit card transactions as
a result of the alleged tying arrangement and monopolization
practices. On June 4, 2003, MasterCard International signed
the Settlement Agreement to settle the claims brought by the
plaintiffs in this matter, which the Court approved on
December 19, 2003. For a further description of the U.S.
merchant lawsuit settlement, see Note 3.

Several lawsuits have been commenced by merchants
who have opted not to participate in the plaintiff class in the
U.S. merchant lawsuit, including Best Buy Stores, CVS, Giant
Eagle, Home Depot, Toys “R” Us and Darden Restaurants.
The majority of these cases were filed in the U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of New York and we expect that
all of these cases will be tried in that Court for, at a
minimum, pretrial issues. On December 31, 2003, MasterCard
entered into an agreement to settle claims brought by an
“opt out” merchant.

In addition, there are currently actions against
MasterCard International in 18 different state courts and the
District of Columbia. In a number of state courts there are
multiple complaints against MasterCard International brought
under state unfair competition statutes on behalf of putative
classes of consumers. The claims in these actions mirror the
allegations made in the U.S. merchant lawsuit and assert that
merchants, faced with excessive merchant discount fees, have
passed these overcharges to consumers in the form of higher
prices on goods and services sold. While these actions are in
their early stages, MasterCard has filed motions to dismiss the
complaints in a number of state courts for failure to state a
cause of action. There have been no decisions on any of these
motions. At this time it is not possible to determine the
outcome of these consumer cases. Neither the consumer class
actions nor the “opt out” merchant litigations are
covered by the terms of the Settlement Agreement in the U.S.
merchant lawsuit.

Global Interchange Proceedings

Interchange fees represent a sharing of payment
system costs among the financial institutions participating in a
four-party payment card system such as MasterCard’s.
Generally, interchange fees are paid by the merchant bank (the
“acquirer”) to the cardholder bank (the
“issuer”) in connection with transactions initiated
with the payment system’s cards. These fees reimburse the
issuer for a portion of the costs incurred by it in providing
services which are of benefit to all participants in the system,
including acquirers and merchants. MasterCard establishes a
multilateral interchange fee (“MIF”) in certain
circumstances as a default fee that applies when there is no
other interchange fee arrangement between the issuer and the
acquirer. MasterCard establishes a variety of MIF rates
depending on such considerations as the location and the type of
transaction, and collects the MIF on behalf of the institutions
entitled to receive it. As described more fully below, MIFs are
subject to regulatory or legal review and/or challenges in a
number of jurisdictions.

European Union.

In
September 2000, the European Commission issued a “Statement
of Objections” challenging Visa International’s
cross-border MIF under European Community competition rules. On
July 24, 2002, the European Commission announced its
decision to exempt the Visa MIF from these rules based on
certain changes proposed by Visa to its MIF. Among other things,
in connection with the exemption order, Visa agreed to adopt a
cost-based methodology for calculating its MIF similar to the
methodology employed by MasterCard, which considers the costs of
certain specified services provided by issuers, and to reduce
its MIF rates for debit and credit transactions to amounts at or
below certain specified levels.

On September 25, 2003, the European
Commission issued a Statement of Objections challenging
MasterCard Europe’s cross-border MIF. MasterCard Europe
filed its response to this Statement of Objections on
January 5, 2004. MasterCard Europe is engaged in
discussions with the European Commission in order to determine
under what conditions, if any, the European Commission would
grant a formal exemption for MasterCard Europe’s MIF. If
MasterCard is unsuccessful in obtaining an exemption, the
European Commission could issue a prohibition decision ordering
MasterCard to change the manner in which it calculates its
cross-border MIF. MasterCard could appeal such a decision to the
European Court of Justice. Because the cross-border MIF
constitutes an essential element of MasterCard Europe’s
operations, changes to it could significantly impact MasterCard
International’s European members and the MasterCard
business in Europe. At this time, it is not possible to
determine the ultimate resolution of this matter.

United Kingdom Office of Fair Trading.

On September 25, 2001, the Office
of Fair Trading of the United Kingdom (“OFT”) issued a
Rule 14 Notice under the U.K. Competition Act 1998
challenging the MasterCard MIF, the fee paid by acquirers to
issuers in connection with point of sale transactions, and
multilateral service fee (“MSF”), the fee paid by
issuers to acquirers when a customer uses a MasterCard-branded
card in the United Kingdom either at an ATM or over the counter
to obtain a cash advance. The MIF and MSF are established by
MasterCard U.K. Members Forum Limited (formerly MEPUK)
(“MMF”) for domestic credit card transactions in the
United Kingdom. The notice contained preliminary conclusions to
the effect that the MasterCard U.K. MIF and MSF may infringe
U.K. competition law and do not qualify for an exemption in
their present forms. In January 2002, MasterCard, MEPUK and
several MasterCard U.K. members responded to the notice, and an
oral hearing concerning the matter was held on February 5,
2002. On February 11, 2003, the OFT issued a supplemental
notice, which also contained preliminary conclusions challenging
MasterCard’s U.K. MIF under the Competition Act. On
May 2, 2003, MasterCard and MMF responded to the
supplemental notice, and a hearing was held on May 21,
2003. The OFT has informed MasterCard that it will issue yet
another notice, thereby delaying any decision by the OFT.

Because the MIF and MSF constitute essential
elements of MasterCard’s U.K. operations, a negative
decision by the OFT could have a significant adverse impact on
MasterCard’s U.K. members and on MasterCard’s
competitive position and overall business in the U.K. In the
event of a negative decision by the



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share
data)

OFT, MasterCard intends to appeal to the relevant
competition tribunal in the U.K. and to seek interim relief if
the negative decision adversely impacts MasterCard’s U.K.
business. At this time, it is not possible to determine the
ultimate resolution of this matter.

Australia.

On
August 27, 2002, the Reserve Bank of Australia
(“RBA”) announced regulations under the Payments
Systems (Regulation) Act 1998 (the “Act”) applicable
to four-party credit card payment systems in Australia,
including MasterCard’s. The RBA regulations, which are
presently in effect, impose a number of changes on the operation
of four-party credit card systems that could significantly
impact MasterCard International’s Australian members and
the MasterCard business in Australia. Among other things, the
RBA regulations permit non-deposit-taking institutions to issue
credit cards and acquire credit card transactions in Australia,
mandate a formula for calculating interchange fees that fails to
account for certain costs incurred by issuers (such as credit
losses) and effectively requires a reduction in domestic
interchange fees, and prohibit MasterCard and other four-party
credit card systems from enforcing their respective “no
surcharge” and “net issuer” rules. The no
surcharge rule generally prevents merchants from charging
supplemental fees for the use of payment cards at the point of
sale, and the net issuer rule requires institutions
participating in the relevant system to issue payment cards in
addition to conducting merchant acquiring activities.

On September 20, 2002, MasterCard filed an
application with the Federal Court of Australia seeking to
overturn the RBA regulations. MasterCard believes that in
implementing the regulations the RBA failed to comply with the
obligations imposed upon it by the Act. On September 19,
2003, the Federal Court of Australia issued its decision
rejecting MasterCard’s claims. Thereafter, MasterCard
appealed the decision on the grounds that the Federal Court made
a number of reversible errors. Subsequently, MasterCard withdrew
its appeal. As a result of the RBA’s decision, MasterCard
expects that it may be at a competitive disadvantage to
competitors that do not operate in a four-party system, such as
American Express and Diners Club, in Australia.

United States.

In
July 2002, a purported class action lawsuit was filed by a group
of merchants in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of California against MasterCard International, Visa
U.S.A., Inc., Visa International Corp. and several member banks
in California (collectively “defendants”) alleging,
among other things, that MasterCard’s and Visa’s
interchange fees contravene the Sherman Act. The suit seeks
treble damages in an unspecified amount, attorney’s fees
and injunctive relief, including the divestiture of bank
ownership of MasterCard and Visa, and the elimination of
MasterCard and Visa marketing activities. On April 21,
2003, the court issued a decision that dismissed several of
plaintiffs’ claims and significantly narrowed the scope of
the remaining claims in the case. Plaintiffs filed an amended
complaint shortly thereafter. On September 16, 2003,
MasterCard filed a combined motion to dismiss and an expedited
motion for summary judgment on the issue of whether member banks
have the ability to opt out of MasterCard’s interchange
structure and enter into bilateral or other interchange
arrangements. A decision on the motion is pending. On
January 16, 2004, the court issued an order to show cause
requiring plaintiffs to show why the matter should not be
dismissed without prejudice in light of the approval of the U.S.
merchant lawsuit settlement. In approving the U.S. merchant
lawsuit settlement, the judge in that case held that the present
matter was extinguished by the settlement and release provided
by the U.S merchants in that lawsuit. Plaintiffs responded to
the Court’s order to show cause. In addition, on
January 8, 2004, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in the
Second Circuit Court of Appeals of their intention to appeal the
order approving the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement release. At
this time it is not possible to determine the outcome of this
matter.

Other Jurisdictions.

MasterCard is aware that regulatory
authorities in certain other jurisdictions, including Poland,
Spain, New Zealand and Switzerland, are reviewing
MasterCard’s and/or its members

interchange fee practices and may seek to
regulate the establishment of such fees. At this time it is not
possible to determine the outcome of these proceedings.

Note 17.

Settlement and Travelers Cheque Risk
    Management

Settlement risk is the legal exposure due to the
difference in timing between the payment transaction date and
subsequent settlement. Settlement risk is estimated using the
average daily card charges during the quarter multiplied by the
estimated number of days to settle. The Company has global risk
management policies and procedures, which include risk standards
to provide a framework for managing the Company’s
settlement exposure. MasterCard International’s rules
generally guarantee the payment of MasterCard transactions and
certain Cirrus and Maestro transactions between principal
members. The term and amount of the guarantee are unlimited.
Member-reported transaction data and the transaction clearing
data underlying the settlement risk exposure calculation may be
revised in subsequent reporting periods.

In the event that MasterCard International
effects a payment on behalf of a failed member, MasterCard
International may seek an assignment of the underlying
receivables. Subject to approval by the Board of Directors,
members may be assessed for the amount of any settlement loss.

MasterCard requires certain members that are not
in compliance with the Company’s risk standards in effect
at the time of review to post collateral, typically in the form
of letters of credit and bank guarantees. This requirement is
based on management review of the individual risk circumstances
for each member that is out of compliance. In addition to these
amounts, MasterCard holds collateral to cover: variability and
future growth in member programs; the possibility that it may
choose to pay merchants to protect brand integrity in the event
of merchant bank (acquirer) failure, although it is not
contractually obligated to do so; and Cirrus and Maestro related
risk. MasterCard monitors its credit risk portfolio on a regular
basis to estimate potential concentration risks and the adequacy
of collateral on hand.

Estimated settlement exposure utilizing the
aforementioned methodology at December 31 was as follows:

The Company currently cannot quantify the
collateral held for Cirrus and Maestro transactions, as legal
settlement exposure is calculated on a regional level as opposed
to the member level. In addition, at December 31, 2002, the
Company guaranteed certain Cirrus- and Maestro-branded
transactions in Europe and certain Maestro-branded transactions
in Latin America that are processed outside of the Cirrus and
Maestro settlement systems. These guarantees were revoked in
Europe and Latin America in December and June 2003, respectively.

MasterCard’s estimated settlement exposure
under the MasterCard brand, net of collateral, had
concentrations of 58% and 62% in North America and 22% and 21%
in Europe at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

A portion of the Company’s uncollateralized
settlement exposure for MasterCard-branded transactions relates
to members that are deemed not to be in compliance with, or that
are under review in connection with,



MASTERCARD INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except per share
data)

the Company’s risk management standards. At
December 31, 2003 and 2002, these amounts were estimated at
$250,984 and $1,053,091, respectively. A significant portion of
this amount ($157,955 and $437,325 for December 31, 2003
and 2002, respectively) is concentrated in three members. The
decrease in uncollateralized exposure for non-compliant members
is mainly attributable to certain members providing collateral,
portfolio transfers to other compliant members, and the
strengthening of member risk profiles due to new risk standards.

For potential uncollateralized member risk
losses, the Company also considers the appropriateness of
establishing reserves for non-payment. MasterCard International
has established such a reserve in the amount of $863 and $1,254
at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

MasterCard guarantees the payment of
MasterCard-branded travelers cheques in the event of issuer
default. These estimates are based on all outstanding
MasterCard-branded travelers cheques, reduced by an actuarial
determination of cheques that are not anticipated to be
presented for payment. The term and amount of the guarantee are
unlimited.

MasterCard calculated its MasterCard-branded
travelers cheques exposure under this guarantee as $1,205,921
and $1,218,429 at December 31, 2003 and December 31,
2002, respectively. The December 31, 2002 amount previously
reported as $1,377,933 has been revised to reflect the cheques
that are not anticipated to be presented for payment pursuant to
the actuarial determination mentioned above.

A significant portion of the Company’s
credit risk is concentrated in one MasterCard travelers cheque
issuer. MasterCard has obtained an unlimited guarantee estimated
at $996,927 and $1,019,739 at December 31, 2003 and
December 31, 2002, respectively, from a financial
institution that is a member, to cover all of the exposure of
outstanding travelers cheques with respect to that issuer. In
addition, MasterCard has obtained guarantees estimated at
$32,101 and $31,594 at December 31, 2003 and
December 31, 2002, respectively, from financial
institutions that are members in order to cover the exposure of
outstanding travelers cheques with respect to another issuer.
These guarantee amounts have also been reduced by an actuarial
determination of cheques that are not anticipated to be
presented for payment. The guarantee amounts were previously
reported as $1,153,233 and $35,731, respectively, as of
December 31, 2002. MasterCard holds approximately $2,579 in
cash in order to meet travelers cheques obligations of certain
issuers that have discontinued their MasterCard travelers
cheques programs.

Based on the Company’s ability to assess its
members for settlement and travelers cheque losses, the
effectiveness of the Company’s global risk management
policies and procedures, and the historically low level of
losses that the Company has experienced, management believes the
probability of future payments for settlement and travelers
cheque losses in excess of existing reserves is negligible.
Accordingly, adoption of the accounting recognition and
measurement provisions of FIN 45 did not have an impact on
the financial position and results of operations of MasterCard
for the year ended December 31, 2003. However,
circumstances in the future may change, which would require the
Company to record an obligation for the fair value of some or
all of its settlement and travelers cheque guarantees.

Note 18.     Foreign
Exchange Risk Management

The Company enters into foreign exchange
contracts to minimize the risk associated with anticipated
receipts and disbursements, and assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies and the possible changes in
value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. MasterCard’s
forward contracts are listed below, classified by functional
currency:

U.S. Dollar Functional
Currency

Euro Functional Currency

The currencies underlying the foreign currency
forward contracts consist primarily of euro, Japanese yen, U.K.
pounds sterling, Swiss francs, Australian dollar, Canadian
dollar and Korean won. The fair value of the foreign currency
forward contracts generally reflects the estimated amounts that
the Company would receive or (pay) to terminate the contracts at
the reporting date based on broker quotes for the same or
similar instruments. The terms of the foreign currency forward
contracts are generally less than 18 months. The Company
has deferred $4,807 and $2,498 of net losses in accumulated
other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively, all of which is expected to be reclassified
to earnings within the next twelve months to provide an economic
offset to the earnings impact of the anticipated cash flows
hedged.

The Company’s derivative financial
instruments are subject to both credit and market risk. Credit
risk is the risk of loss due to failure of a counterparty to
perform its obligations in accordance with contractual terms.
Market risk is the potential change in an investment’s
value caused by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange
rates, credit spreads or other variables. Credit and market risk
related to derivative instruments were not material at
December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002.

Generally, the Company does not obtain collateral
related to forward contracts because of the high credit ratings
of the counter-parties that are members. The amount of
accounting loss the Company would incur if the counterparties
failed to perform according to the terms of the contracts is not
considered material.

Note 19.     Segment
Reporting

In accordance with SFAS No. 131,
“Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information,” MasterCard has one reportable segment,
“Payment Services.” All of the Company’s
activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent upon
and supportive of the other. Accordingly, all significant
operating decisions are based upon analyses of MasterCard as one
operating segment. The CEO has been identified as the chief
operating decision-maker.
