                 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS OR INFORMATION
                                     
      This  Form 10-K includes certain statements that may be deemed to  be
"forward-looking  statements" within the meaning of the Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform  Act  of 1995. Statements included  or  incorporated  by
reference   in  this  Form  10-K  which  address  activities,   events   or
developments that the Company expects or anticipates will or may  occur  in
the future, including such things as future capital expenditures (including
the  amount and nature thereof), expansion and other development trends  of
industry  segments  in  which  the Company is  active,  business  strategy,
expansion  and  growth of the Company's business and operations  and  other
such  matters are forward-looking statements. Although the Company believes
the expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements are based  on
reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its  business,
a  number  of factors could cause actual results to differ materially  from
those expressed in any forward-looking statements, whether oral or written,
made  by or on behalf of the Company. Many of these factors have previously
been  identified  in  filings or statements made by or  on  behalf  of  the
Company.

     All  phases  of  the  Company's operations are subject  to  influences
outside  its  control. Any one, or a combination, of  these  factors  could
materially  affect the results of the Company's operations.  These  factors
include: the cost of goods, competitive pressures, inflation, consumer debt
levels,  currency  exchange fluctuations, trade  restrictions,  changes  in
tariff  and freight rates, Year 2000 issues, unemployment levels,  interest
rate fluctuations and other capital market and economic conditions. Forward-
looking  statements  made by or on behalf of the Company  are  based  on  a
knowledge  of  its business and the environment in which it  operates,  but
because  of the factors listed above, actual results may differ from  those
in the forward-looking statements. Consequently, all of the forward-looking
statements made are qualified by these and other cautionary statements  and
there  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  actual  results  or  developments
anticipated  by  the  Company will be realized or,  even  if  substantially
realized,  that they will have the expected consequences to or  effects  on
the Company or its business or operations.

                          FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT
                    FOR THE YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 1999
                                     
                                  PART I
                                     
ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

      Wal-Mart  Stores,  Inc.  (together with its subsidiaries  hereinafter
referred  to as the "Company") is the world's largest retailer measured  by
total revenues.  During the fiscal year ended January 31, 1999, the Company
had net sales of $137,634,000,000.

          (a)  Development of Business

           Domestically,  at January 31, 1999, the Company  operated  1,869
discount  stores  and  564  Supercenters,  and  451  SAM'S  Clubs.   Tables
summarizing  information concerning additions of units and  square  footage
for  domestic  discount stores, Supercenters and SAM'S Clubs since  January
31, 1994, are included as Schedules A and B to Item 1 found on pages 10 and
11 of this annual report.

           In fiscal 1999, the Company took possession of 74 units from the
Interspar hypermarket chain in Germany.  The units were acquired from  Spar
Handels  AG,  a  German  company  that owns  multiple  retail  formats  and
wholesale  operations  throughout  Germany.   The  transaction  closed   on
December  29,  1998, Interspar's fiscal year end.  Therefore, the  acquired
assets  are  included  in the Company's consolidated balance  sheet  as  of
January  31, 1999, and the results of operations will be included beginning
in fiscal 2000.

          In fiscal 1999, the Company extended its presence in Asia with an
investment  in  Korea.  The Company acquired a majority  interest  in  four
existing  units as well as six undeveloped sites.  The four acquired  units
were  previously operated by Korea Makro.  The results of operations  since
the  effective date of the acquisition have been included in the  Company's
results of operations.

           See  Note  6  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements
incorporated  by reference in Item 8 of Part II found on page  17  of  this
annual report for additional information regarding our acquisitions.

           Internationally, at January 31, 1999, the Company operated units
in  Argentina(13), Brazil(14), Canada(154), Germany(95),  Mexico(416),  and
Puerto  Rico(15),  and,  under joint venture agreements,  in  China(5)  and
Korea(4).   A table summarizing information concerning additions  of  units
and  square footage for international units operated since fiscal 1994,  is
included as Schedule C to Item 1 found on page 12 of this annual report.





          (b)  Financial information about the Company's industry segments

           The  Company  is  principally engaged in the operation  of  mass
merchandising  stores,  which  serve our customers  primarily  through  the
operation of three segments.

            The   Company   identifies   segments   based   on   management
responsibility  within  the  United  States  and  geographically  for   all
international  units.  The Wal-Mart Stores segment includes  the  Company's
discount  stores  and  Supercenters in the United States.  The  SAM'S  Club
segment  includes the warehouse membership clubs in the United States.  The
International segment includes all operations in Argentina, Brazil, Canada,
China,  Germany, Korea, Mexico and Puerto Rico.  For the financial  results
of  the  Company's operating segments, see Note 9 of Notes to  Consolidated
Financial Statements incorporated by reference in Item 8 of Part  II  found
on page 17 of this annual report.

          (c)  Narrative Description of Business

          The Company, a Delaware corporation, has its principal offices in
Bentonville,  Arkansas.  Although the Company was incorporated  in  October
1969,  the businesses conducted by its predecessors began in 1945 when  Sam
M.  Walton  opened  a  franchise Ben Franklin  variety  store  in  Newport,
Arkansas.  In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in
Versailles,  Missouri.   Until  1962, the Company's  business  was  devoted
entirely to the operation of variety stores.  In that year, the first  Wal-
Mart  Discount  City  (discount store) was opened.   In  fiscal  1984,  the
Company  opened its first three SAM'S Clubs, and in fiscal 1988, its  first
Wal-Mart   Supercenter  (combination  full-line  supermarket  and  discount
store).   In  fiscal  1992,  the  Company  began  its  first  international
initiative when the Company entered into a joint venture in which it had  a
50%  interest with Cifra S.A. de C.V. (Cifra).  The Company's international
presence  has continued to expand and at January 31, 1999, the Company  had
operations in seven countries and Puerto Rico.

WAL-MART STORES OPERATING SEGMENT

           The  Wal-Mart  Stores  segment,  which  includes  the  Company's
discount  stores  and  Supercenters in the  United  States,  had  sales  of
$95,395,000,000, $83,820,000,000 and $74,840,000,000 for the  three  fiscal
years ended January 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. During the most
recent  fiscal  year,  no  single discount store  or  Supercenter  location
accounted for as much as 1% of total Company sales or net income. See  Note
9  of  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference
in  Item 8 of Part II found on page 17 of this annual report for additional
information regarding our segments.

          General.  The Company operates Wal-Mart discount stores in all 50
states.   The  average  size of a discount store  is  approximately  94,300
square feet. Wal-Mart Supercenters are located in 29 states and the average
size  of  a  Supercenter is 181,200 square feet. The Supercenter prototypes
range in size from 110,000 square feet to 234,000 square feet.




            Merchandise.    Wal-Mart  discount  stores  and   the   general
merchandise  area  of  the  Supercenters are generally  organized  with  40
departments and offer a wide variety of merchandise, including apparel  for
women,  girls,  men, boys and infants.  Each store also carries  domestics,
fabrics  and  notions,  stationery and books, shoes, housewares,  hardware,
electronics,  home  furnishings, small appliances, automotive  accessories,
horticulture   and  accessories,  sporting  goods,  toys,  pet   food   and
accessories,  cameras and supplies, health and beauty aids, pharmaceuticals
and  jewelry.  In  addition,  the stores offer  an  assortment  of  grocery
merchandise,  with  the  assortment  in  Supercenters  being  broader   and
including meat, produce, deli, bakery, dairy, frozen foods and dry grocery.

           Nationally  advertised merchandise accounts for  a  majority  of
sales  in the stores. The Company markets lines of merchandise under  store
brands  including but not limited to "Sam's American Choice", "One Source",
"Great  Value", "Ol' Roy" and "Equate". The Company also markets  lines  of
merchandise  under  licensed brands; some of which include  "Faded  Glory",
"Kathie  Lee", "White Stag", "Puritan", "Better Homes & Gardens",  "Popular
Mechanics", "Catalina", "McKids", "Basic Equipment" and "House Beautiful".

           During the fiscal year ended January 31, 1999, sales in discount
stores and Supercenters (which are subject to seasonal variance) by product
category were as follows:
                                              PERCENTAGE
          CATEGORY                             OF SALES

                                                  100%

           Operations.  Hours of operations vary by location, but generally
range from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. six days a week, and from 10:00 a.m.  to
8:00 p.m. on Sunday for discount stores and Supercenters.  In addition,  an
increasing number of discount stores and almost all of the Supercenters are
open 24 hours each day.  Wal-Mart discount stores and Supercenters maintain
uniform  prices,  except  where lower prices are necessary  to  meet  local
competition.   Sales are primarily on a self-service, cash-and-carry  basis
with  the objective of maximizing sales volume and inventory turnover while
minimizing expenses.  Bank credit card programs, operated without  recourse
to the Company, are available in all stores.

           Seasonal  Aspects of Operations.  The Wal-Mart Stores  operating
segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent.  Generally, the highest




volume  of sales occurs in the fourth fiscal quarter and the lowest  volume
occurs during the first fiscal quarter.

            Competition.   Wal-Mart  discount  stores  compete  with  other
discount, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, many of which are
national chains.  Wal-Mart Supercenters compete with other supercenter-type
stores,  discount stores, supermarkets and specialty stores, many of  which
are national or regional chains.  The Company also competes with others for
new  club  sites.  As of January 31, 1999, based on net sales, the Wal-Mart
Stores  segment ranked first among all retail department store  chains  and
among all discount department store chains.

          The Company's competitive position within the industry is largely
determined by its ability to offer value and service to its customers.  The
Company  has  many programs designed to meet the competitive needs  of  its
industry.  These include "Everyday Low Price", "Item Merchandising", "Store-
Within-a-Store"  and  "Price  Rollbacks" programs.   Although  the  Company
believes  it  has  had a major influence in most of the retail  markets  in
which  its  stores  are  located, there is  no  assurance  that  this  will
continue.

           Distribution.  During the 1999 fiscal year, approximately 84% of
the Wal-Mart discount stores' and Supercenters' purchases were shipped from
Wal-Mart's  43 distribution centers, nine of which are grocery distribution
centers,  and two of which are import distribution centers. The balance  of
merchandise  purchased was shipped directly to the stores  from  suppliers.
The  43 centers are located throughout the continental United States.  Five
distribution  centers are located in each of Arkansas and Texas;  three  in
South  Carolina;  two  in  each of California, Florida,  Georgia,  Indiana,
Mississippi,  New  York  and Pennsylvania; and  one  in  each  of  Alabama,
Arizona,  Colorado,  Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, New  Hampshire,  New
Mexico,  North  Carolina,  Ohio,  Oregon,  Tennessee,  Utah,  Virginia  and
Wisconsin.

SAM'S CLUB OPERATING SEGMENT

           The  SAM'S Club segment, which includes the warehouse membership
clubs  in  the United States, had sales of $22,881,000,000, $20,668,000,000
and  $19,785,000,000  for the three fiscal years ended  January  31,  1999,
1998,  and  1997,  respectively.  During the most recent  fiscal  year,  no
single club location accounted for as much as 1% of total Company sales  or
net  income.  See  Note  9  of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements
incorporated  by reference in Item 8 of Part II found on page  17  of  this
annual report for additional information regarding our segments.

           General.  The  Company operates SAM'S Clubs in 48  states.   The
average size of a SAM'S Club is approximately 121,200 square feet, and club
sizes  generally range between 90,000 and 150,000 square feet  of  building
area.

           Merchandise.  SAM'S  Clubs offer bulk  displays  of  name  brand
hardgood merchandise, some softgoods and institutional size grocery  items,
and  selected items under the "Member's Mark" store brand.  Generally  each




SAM'S  Club  also carries software and electronic goods, jewelry,  sporting
goods,  toys,  tires,  stationery and books.  Most clubs  have  fresh  food
departments,  which  include bakery, meat and produce.  In  addition,  some
clubs offer one-hour photo, embroidery departments, pharmaceuticals and gas
stations.

          During the fiscal year ended January 31, 1999, sales in the clubs
(which  are  subject  to  seasonal variance) by product  category  were  as
follows:

                                              PERCENTAGE
          CATEGORY                             OF SALES

          Sundries..........................       31.6
          Food .............................       32.8
          Hardlines ........................       22.1
          Softlines ........................        5.7
          Service Businesses................        7.8
                                                  100.0%

          Operations.  Operating hours vary among SAM'S Clubs, but they are
generally  open  Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:30  p.m.   Most
SAM'S  Clubs  are open Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and  on  Sunday
from 11:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.

           SAM'S  Clubs  are  membership only,  cash-and-carry  operations.
However,  a  financial  service  credit card  program  (Discover  Card)  is
available  in  all clubs and the "SAM'S Direct" commercial finance  program
and  "Business  Revolving  Credit"  are available  to  qualifying  business
members.  Also, a "Personal Credit" program is available to qualifying club
members.  Any credit issued under these programs is without recourse to the
Company.   Club  members include businesses and those individuals  who  are
members  of certain qualifying organizations, such as government and  state
employees and credit union members.  In fiscal 1999, business members  paid
an  annual  membership fee of $30 for the primary membership  card  with  a
spouse card available at no additional cost.  The annual membership fee for
an  individual member is $35 for the primary membership card with a  spouse
card available at no additional cost.

            Seasonal  Aspects  of  Operations.  The  SAM'S  Club  operating
segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent.  Generally, the highest
volume  of sales occurs in the fourth fiscal quarter and the lowest  volume
occurs during the first fiscal quarter.

           Competition.  SAM'S Clubs compete with warehouse clubs, as  well
as  with  discount  retailers, wholesale grocers  and  general  merchandise
wholesalers and distributors. The Company also competes with others for new
club sites.  As of January 31, 1999, based on domestic U.S. net sales,  the
SAM'S Club segment ranked first among all warehouse clubs.

          Distribution.  During fiscal 1999, approximately 61% of the SAM'S
Club  purchases were shipped from distribution facilities. The balance  was
shipped directly to the clubs from suppliers.  Operationally, the principle




focus  is  on  crossdocking product, while maintaining stored inventory  is
minimized.   A  combination of Company owned and  operated  facilities  and
third-party facilities comprise the overall distribution structure.


INTERNATIONAL OPERATING SEGMENT

           The Company's International Segment is comprised of wholly owned
operations  in  Argentina, Canada, Germany and Puerto Rico;  through  joint
ventures  in  China and Korea; and through majority-owned  subsidiaries  in
Brazil and Mexico. Sales for the three fiscal years ended January 31, 1999,
1998,  and  1997  were $12,247,000,000, $7,517,000,000 and  $5,002,000,000,
respectively.   During  the  most recent fiscal year,  no  single  location
accounted for as much as 1% of total Company sales or net income. See  Note
9  of  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference
in  Item 8 of Part II found on page 17 of this annual report for additional
information regarding our segments.

          General.  Operating formats vary by country, but include Wal-Mart
discount  stores  in  Canada  and Puerto Rico; Supercenters  in  Argentina,
Brazil,  China, Korea and Mexico; SAM'S Clubs in Argentina, Brazil,  China,
Mexico, and Puerto Rico; Hypermarkets in Germany and Superamas (traditional
supermarket,)  Bodegas  (discount  store,)  Aurreras  (combination  store,)
Suburbias (specialty department store) and Vips (restaurant) in Mexico.

           Merchandise.    The merchandising strategy in the  International
operating  segment is similar to that of domestic segments in  the  breadth
and  scope  of merchandise offered for sale.  While brand name  merchandise
accounts  for  a majority of sales, several store brands not found  in  the
United  States  have  been developed to serve customers  in  the  different
markets  in  which the International segment operates.  In addition,  steps
have been taken to develop relationships with local vendors in each country
to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise.

           Operations.  The hours of operation for operating units  in  the
international  division  vary by country and by individual  markets  within
countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours  of
operation.   While  sales are primarily on a cash-and-carry  basis,  credit
cards  or  other  consumer finance programs exist  in  certain  markets  to
facilitate the purchase of goods by the customer.

           Seasonal  Aspects  of  Operations.  The International  operating
segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent.  Generally, the highest
volume  of  sales occurs in the fourth fiscal quarter.  The seasonality  of
the  business  varies  by country due to different national  and  religious
holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different climatic conditions.

          Competition.  The International operating segment competes with a
variety  of  local,  national and international  chains  in  the  discount,
department,  drug, variety, specialty and wholesale sectors of  the  retail
market.   The  segment's  competitive position is determined,  to  a  large
extent,  by  its  ability  to offer its customers  low  prices  on  quality
merchandise that offers exceptional value.  In Supercenters, our ability to




effectively  operate  the  food departments  has  a  major  impact  on  the
segment's  competitive position in the markets where we operate.

            Distribution.    The  International  segment  operates   export
consolidation facilities in Jacksonville, Florida; Seattle, Washington; and
Laredo,  Texas in support of product flow to its Mexican, Asian, and  Latin
American  markets.   In addition, distribution facilities  are  located  in
Argentina,  Brazil, Canada, China and Mexico which process  and  flow  both
imported  and domestic product to the operating units.  Operationally,  the
principle  focus  is  on  crossdocking product,  while  maintaining  stored
inventory  is  minimized.   During fiscal 1999, approximately  50%  of  the
International  merchandise  purchases  flowed  through  these  distribution
facilities.  The balance was shipped directly to the stores from suppliers.
A  combination  of  Company owned and operated facilities  and  third-party
facilities  comprises the overall distribution structure for  International
logistics.

to  the  table  under  the caption "Fiscal 1999 End of  Year  Store  Counts"  on
Page  17  of  the Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended  January  31,
1999.

            The  Company  owns  1,488  properties  on  which  domestic  discount
stores  and  Supercenters  are  located and  214  of  the  properties  on  which
domestic  SAM'S  are  located.   In  some  cases,  the  Company  owns  the  land
associated  with  leased  buildings.   New buildings,  both  leased  and  owned,
are constructed by independent contractors.

           The  remaining  buildings  in which its  present  domestic  locations
are  located  are  either  leased from a commercial property  developer,  leased
pursuant   to   a   sale/leaseback  arrangement   or   leased   from   a   local
governmental  entity  through an industrial revenue bond  transaction.   All  of
the  Company's  leases  for  its stores provide for fixed  annual  rentals  and,
in   many  cases,  the  leases  provide  for  additional  rent  based  on  sales
volume.

            Domestically,   the   Company  operated  43  Wal-Mart   distribution
facilities  and  19  McLane  distribution  facilities  at  January   31,   1999.
These   distribution  facilities  are  primarily  owned  by  the  Company,   and
several  are  subject  to  mortgage secured loans.   Some  of  the  distribution
facilities   are   leased   under   industrial   development   bond    financing
arrangements  and  provide  the option of purchasing  these  facilities  at  the
end of the lease term for nominal amounts.

           The  Company  owns  office facilities in Bentonville,  Arkansas  that
serve  as  the  home  office  for the Company and owns  an  office  facility  in
Temple, Texas which serves as the home office for McLane.

            Internationally,  the  Company  has  a  combination  of  owned   and
leased  properties  in each country in which the operating  units  are  located.

seven  properties  in  Canada, one property in China  under  joint  venture,  21
properties  in  Germany,  four  properties in Korea  under  joint  venture,  242
properties  in  Mexico,  and  four  properties  in  Puerto  Rico  in  which  the
operating  units  are located, with the remaining units in  each  country  being

facilities in each country in which we conduct business.

ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

            The   Company  is  not  a  party  to  any  material  pending   legal
proceedings  and  no  properties of the Company  are  subject  to  any  material
pending  legal  proceeding,  other than routine  litigation  incidental  to  its
business.




            The   Company   recently   opened  a   Supercenter   in   Honesdale,
Pennsylvania.   In  February of 1999, the Company settled  claims  made  by  the
Pennsylvania  Department  of  Environmental  Protection  that  the  construction
activities  led  to  excess erosion and sedimentation of  a  nearby  creek.   In
the  settlement,  Wal-Mart  agreed to pay a fine of $25,000  and  to  perform  a
$75,000  community  environmental project in the Honesdale  area.   The  Company
is  negotiating  settlement  of  a claim by the  United  States  Army  Corps  of
Engineers  that  the  construction  resulted in  the  filling  of  approximately
0.76  acres  in  excess  of the permitted fill area of waters  and  wetlands  at
the  site.   The  proposed settlement with the Corps will  require  Wal-Mart  to
pay  $200,000  to  a non-profit corporation for the purchase of  local  wetlands
conservation  areas  and  easements.  Under   contracts   with  third   parties,
Wal-Mart  has received  reimbursement  for the $75,000  community  environmental
project and the $25,000  fine.  Wal-Mart  also  expects to be  reimbursed  under
third  party contracts for the $200,000 proposed settlement amount.
