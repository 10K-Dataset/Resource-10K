expansion and growth of the Company’s business and operations and other such matters
are forward-looking statements. Although the Company believes the expectations expressed

results of ASDA operations are included in the Company’s consolidated statements of
income for the year ended January 31, 2000. ASDA reports on a December 31 year-end,
therefore ASDA results are consolidated on a trailing month reporting basis.

operations in Korea from its joint venture partner. The Company anticipates that the
remaining minority interest will be acquired in early fiscal 2001.

Narrative Description of Business

The Company, a Delaware
corporation, has its principal offices in Bentonville, Arkansas. Although the Company was
incorporated in October 1969, the businesses conducted by its predecessors began in 1945
when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In
1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until
1962, the Company’s business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores.
In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City (discount store) was opened. In fiscal
1984, the Company opened its first three SAM’S Clubs, and in fiscal 1988, its first
Wal-Mart Supercenter (combination full-line supermarket and discount store). In fiscal
1992, the Company began its first international initiative when the Company entered into a
joint venture in which it had a 50% interest with Cifra S.A. de C.V. (Cifra). The
Company’s international presence has continued to expand and at January 31, 2000, the
Company had international operations in eight countries and Puerto Rico. In February 2000,
Cirfa officially changed its name to Wal-Mart de Mexico, S.A. de C.V.

WAL-MART STORES OPERATING SEGMENT

The Wal-Mart Stores segment,
which includes the Company’s discount stores and Supercenters in the United States,
had sales of $108,721,000,000, $95,395,000,000 and $83,820,000,000 for the three fiscal
years ended January 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. During the most recent fiscal
year, no single discount store or Supercenter location accounted for as much as 1% of
total Company sales or net income. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial

Page 4 of 25 (Form 10-K)

Statements incorporated by reference in Item 8 of Part II, found on
page 19 of this annual report for additional information regarding our operating segments.

General.

The Company operates Wal-Mart discount stores in all 50 states. The average size of a
discount store is approximately 94,800 square feet. Wal-Mart Supercenters are located in
34 states and the average size of a Supercenter is 181,300 square feet. The Supercenter
prototypes range in size from 110,000 square feet to 241,000 square feet.

Merchandise.

Wal-Mart discount stores and the general merchandise area of the Supercenters are
generally organized with 40 departments and offer a wide variety of merchandise, including
apparel for women, girls, men, boys and infants. Each store also carries domestics,
fabrics and notions, stationery and books, shoes, housewares, hardware, electronics, home
furnishings, small appliances, automotive accessories, horticulture and accessories,
sporting goods, toys, pet food and accessories, cameras and supplies, health and beauty
aids, pharmaceuticals and jewelry. In addition, the stores offer an assortment of grocery
merchandise, with the grocery assortment in Supercenters being broader and including meat,
produce, deli, bakery, dairy, frozen foods and dry grocery.

Nationally advertised
merchandise accounts for a majority of sales in the stores. The Company markets lines of
merchandise under store brands including but not limited to "Sam’s American
Choice", "One Source", "Great Value", "Ol’ Roy"
and "Equate". The Company also markets lines of merchandise under licensed
brands, some of which include "Faded Glory", "Kathie Lee", "White
Stag", "Puritan", "Better Homes & Gardens", "Popular
Mechanics", "Catalina", "McKids", and "Basic
Equipment".

During the fiscal year ended
January 31, 2000, sales in discount stores and Supercenters (which are subject to seasonal
variance) by product category were as follows:

Operations.

Hours
of operation for nearly all Supercenters and an increasing number of discount stores are
24 hours each day. Hours of operation

Page 5 of 25 (Form 10-K)

for the remaining discount stores vary by location, but generally range
from 7:00a.m. to 11:00 p.m., six days a week, and from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. on Sundays.
Wal-Mart discount stores and Supercenters maintain uniform prices, except where lower
prices are necessary to meet local competition. Sales are primarily on a self-service,
cash-and-carry basis with the objective of maximizing sales volume and inventory turnover
while minimizing expenses. Bank credit card programs, operated without recourse to the
Company, are available in all stores.

Seasonal Aspects of
Operations.

The Wal-Mart Stores operating segment’s business is seasonal to a
certain extent. Generally, the highest volume of sales occurs in the Company’s fourth
fiscal quarter and the lowest volume occurs during its first fiscal quarter.

Competition.

Wal-Mart discount stores compete with other discount, department, drug, variety and
specialty stores, many of which are national chains. Wal-Mart Supercenters compete with
other supercenter-type stores, discount stores, supermarkets and specialty stores, many of
which are national or regional chains. The Company also competes with others for new store
sites. As of January 31, 2000, based on net sales, the Wal-Mart Stores segment ranked
first among all retail department store chains and among all discount department store
chains.

The Company’s
competitive position within the industry is largely determined by its ability to offer
value and service to its customers. The Company has many programs designed to meet the
competitive pressures within its industry. These include the Company’s "Everyday
Low Price", "Item Merchandising", "Store-Within-a-Store" and
"Price Rollbacks" programs. Although the Company believes it has had a major
influence in most of the retail markets in which its stores are located, there is no
assurance that this influence will continue.

Distribution.

During fiscal 2000, approximately 83% of the Wal-Mart discount stores’ and
Supercenters’ purchases were shipped from Wal-Mart’s 45 distribution centers,
ten of which are grocery distribution centers, and two of which are import distribution
centers. The balance of merchandise purchased was shipped directly to the stores from
suppliers. The 45 distribution centers are located throughout the continental United
States. Five distribution centers are located in each of Arkansas and Texas; three in each
of South Carolina and New York; two in each of California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana,
Mississippi, and Pennsylvania; and one in each of Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Iowa,
Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon,
Tennessee, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin.

SAM’S CLUB OPERATING SEGMENT

The SAM’S Club segment,
which includes the warehouse membership clubs in the United States, had sales of
$24,801,000,000, $22,881,000,000 and $20,668,000,000 for the three fiscal years ended
January 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no
single club location accounted for as much as 1% of total Company sales or net income. See
Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference in Item 8
of

Page 6 of 25 (Form 10-K)

Part II found on page 19 of this annual report for additional
information regarding our segments.

General.

The
Company operates SAM’S Clubs in 48 states. The average size of a SAM’S Club is
approximately 121,700 square feet, and club sizes generally range between 90,000 and
154,000 square feet of building area.

Merchandise

.

SAM’S
Clubs offer bulk displays of name brand hardgood merchandise, some softgoods and
institutional size grocery items, and selected items under the "Member's Mark"
store brand. Generally each SAM’S Club also carries software, electronic goods,
jewelry, sporting goods, toys, tires, stationery and books. Most clubs have fresh food
departments, which include bakery, meat and produce. In addition, some clubs offer
one-hour photo, embroidery departments, pharmaceuticals, optical departments and gas
stations.

During the fiscal year ended
January 31, 2000, sales in the clubs (which are subject to seasonal variance) by product
category were as follows:

Operations.

Operating
hours vary among SAM’S Clubs, but they are generally open Monday through Friday from
10:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Sunday from 11:00 a.m. to
6:00 p.m.

SAM’S Clubs are
membership only, cash-and-carry operations. However, a financial service credit card
program (Discover Card) is available in all clubs and the "SAM’S Direct"
commercial finance program and "Business Revolving Credit" are available to
qualifying business members. Also, a "Personal Credit" program is available to
qualifying club members. Any credit extended to members under these programs is without
recourse to the Company. Club members include businesses and those individuals who are
members of certain qualifying organizations, such as government and state employees and
credit union members. In fiscal 2000, business members paid an annual membership fee of
$30 for the primary membership card with a spouse card available at no additional cost.
The annual membership fee for an individual member is $35 for the primary membership card
with a spouse card available at no additional cost. During fiscal 2000, SAM’S Clubs
launched an Elite Membership program which offers additional benefits such as long
distance service, roadside assistance, internet access, home improvement, Telebank,
business insurance and financial planning, auto brokering, pharmacy discounts, and
entertainment savings guides to Elite Members. The annual membership fee for an Elite
Member is $100.

Seasonal Aspects of
Operations.

The SAM’S Club operating segment’s business is seasonal to a
certain extent. Generally, the highest volume of sales occurs in the Company’s fourth
fiscal quarter and the lowest volume occurs during its first fiscal quarter.

Competition.

SAM’S Clubs compete with other warehouse clubs, as well as with discount retailers,
wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors. The Company also
competes with others for new club sites. As of January 31, 2000, based on domestic U.S.
net sales, the SAM’S Club segment ranked first among all warehouse clubs.

Distribution.

During fiscal 2000, approximately 57% of the SAM’S Club purchases were shipped from
the Segment’s distribution facilities. The balance was shipped directly to the clubs
location from suppliers. Operationally, the principal focus is on crossdocking product,
while maintaining stored inventory is minimized. A combination of 6 Company owned and
operated facilities and 19 third-party owned and operated facilities comprise the overall
distribution structure for the SAM’s Club segment. Two of the Company owned and
operated facilities are located in Texas with one located in each of Arkansas, Colorado,
Minnesota and Indiana. Of the third party owned and operated facilities, two are located
in each of Illinois, Ohio and Texas and one in each of Arizona, Arkansas, California,
Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania and Washington.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATING SEGMENT

The Company’s
International Segment is comprised of wholly owned operations in Argentina, Canada,
Germany, Korea, Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom; of operations through joint ventures
in China; and of opertions through majority-owned subsidiaries in Brazil and Mexico. Sales
for the three fiscal years ended January 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, were $22,728,000,000,
$12,247,000,000 and $7,517,000,000, respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no
single location accounted for as much as 1% of total Company sales or net income. See Note
9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference in Item 8 of
Part II found on page 19 of this annual report for additional information regarding our
segments.

General.

Operating formats vary by country, but include Wal-Mart discount stores in Canada and
Puerto Rico; Supercenters in Argentina, Brazil, China, Korea and Mexico; SAM’S Clubs
in Brazil, China, Mexico, and Puerto Rico; Hypermarkets in Germany; Superamas (traditional
supermarket), Bodegas (discount store), Aurreras (combination store), Suburbias (specialty
department store) and Vips (restaurant) in Mexico and ASDA stores (combination grocery and
apparel store) in the United Kingdom. In March 2000, the Company announced the sale of

Page 8 of 25 (Form 10-K)

all three of the Company’s SAM’S Clubs in Argentina. The sale
is being made so that the Company can concentrate on expanding its Supercenter business
within Argentina.

Merchandise.

The merchandising strategy in the International operating segment is similar to that of
domestic segments in the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand
name merchandise accounts for a majority of sales, several store brands not found in the
United States have been developed to serve customers in the different markets in which the
International segment operates. In addition, steps have been taken to develop
relationships with local vendors in each country to ensure reliable sources of quality
merchandise.

Operations.

The hours of operation for operating units in the international division vary by country
and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances
governing hours of operation. While sales are primarily on a cash-and-carry basis, credit
cards or other consumer finance programs exist in certain markets to facilitate the
purchase of goods by the customer.

Seasonal Aspects of
Operations.

The International operating segment’s business is seasonal to a
certain extent. Generally, the highest volume of sales occurs in the Company’s fourth
fiscal quarter. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different
national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different climatic
conditions.

Competition.

The International operating segment competes with a variety of local, national and
international chains in the discount, department, drug, variety, specialty and wholesale
sectors of the retail market. The segment’s competitive position is determined, to a
large extent, by its ability to offer its customers low prices on quality merchandise that
offers exceptional value. In Supercenters, our ability to effectively operate the food
departments has a major impact on the segment’s competitive position in the markets
where we operate.

Distribution.

The International segment operates export consolidation facilities in Los Angeles,
California; Jacksonville, Florida; Seattle, Washington; and Laredo, Texas in support of
product flow to its Mexican, Asian, and Latin American markets. Distribution facilities
are located in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom
and Mexico which process and distribte both imported and domestic product to the operating
units. Operationally, the principal focus is on crossdocking product, while maintaining
stored inventory is minimized. During fiscal 2000, approximately 80% of the International
merchandise purchases flowed through these distribution facilities. The balance was
shipped directly to the stores from suppliers. A combination of Company owned and operated
facilities and third-party facilities comprises the overall distribution structure for
International logistics.

The sales reported in the
"Other" category included in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements incorporated by reference in Item 8 of Part II found on page 19 of this annual
report, result from sales to third parties by McLane Company, Inc. (McLane). McLane is a
wholly-owned wholesale distributor that sells its merchandise to a variety of retailers,
primarily in the convenience store industry. McLane also services Wal-Mart discount
stores, Supercenters and SAM’S Clubs. Sales to third parties for the three fiscal
years ended January 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 were $8,763,000,000, $7,111,000,000 and
$5,953,000,000 respectively. McLane offers a wide variety of grocery and non-grocery
products, including perishable and non-perishable items. The non-grocery products consist

stationery.

During fiscal 2000, McLane

leaving 16 distribution centers from which its customers, including the Company, are
served. The distribution centers are located in the continental United States with two
located in each of California and Texas, and one each in Arizona, Alabama, Colorado,
Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and
Washington.

Employees (Associates).

associates worldwide, with approximately 885,000 in the United States and 255,000
internationally. Most associates participate in incentive programs, which provide the
opportunity to receive additional compensation based upon the Company’s productivity
or profitability.

PROPERTIES

The number and location of
domestic and international Wal-Mart discount stores, Supercenters and SAM’S Clubs is
incorporated by reference to the table under the caption "Fiscal 2000 End of Year
Store Counts" on page 6 of the Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended
January 31, 2000.

The Company owns 1,352 of
the properties on which domestic discount stores and Supercenters are located and 295 of
the properties on which domestic SAM’S Clubs are located. In some cases, the Company
owns the land associated with leased buildings. New buildings, both leased and owned, are
constructed by independent contractors.

The remaining buildings in
which its present domestic locations are located are either leased from a commercial
property developer, leased pursuant to a sale/leaseback arrangement or leased from a local
governmental entity through an industrial revenue bond transaction. All of the
Company’s leases for its stores provide for fixed annual rentals and, in many cases,
the leases provide for additional rent based on sales volume.

Domestically, the Company
operated 45 Wal-Mart distribution facilities and 16 McLane distribution facilities as of
January 31, 2000. These distribution facilities are primarily owned by the Company, and
several are subject to mortgages granted to secure loans. Some of the distribution
facilities are leased under industrial development bond financing arrangements and provide
the option of purchasing these facilities at the end of the lease term for nominal
amounts.

The Company owns office
facilities in Bentonville, Arkansas that serve as the home office for the Company and an
office facility in Temple, Texas which serves as the home office for McLane.

Internationally, the Company
has a combination of owned and leased properties in each country in which the operating
units are located. The Company owns seven properties in Argentina, nine properties in
Brazil, 11 properties in Canada, one property in China through joint venture, 19
properties in Germany, five properties in Korea, 186 properties in Mexico, two properties
in Puerto Rico  and 83 properties in the Undited Kingdom in which the operating units

business.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is not a party
to any material pending legal proceedings. Neither the Company nor any of its properties
is subject to any material pending legal proceeding, other than routine litigation
incidental to the Company’s business.

Page 15 of 25 (Form 10-K)

The Company recently opened
a Supercenter in Honesdale, Pennsylvania. In February of 1999, the Company settled claims
made by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PDEP) that a
subcontractor’s acts and omissions relating to the construction of the Supercenter
led to excess erosion and sedimentation of a nearby creek. In the settlement, Wal-Mart
agreed to pay a fine of $25,000 and to perform a $75,000 community environmental project
in the Honesdale area. The Company is negotiating settlement of a claim by the United
States Army Corps of Engineers that the construction resulted in the filling of
approximately 0.76 acres in excess of the permitted fill area of waters and wetlands at
the site. The proposed settlement with the Corps will require Wal-Mart to pay $200,000 to
a non-profit corporation for the purchase of local wetlands conservation areas and
easements. The Company has been reimbursed for these amounts by the contractor on the
project.

The United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is threatening to bring suit against the Company and
five of its contractors over alleged violations of a 1992 storm water permit issued with
respect to various Wal-Mart development sites in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. The EPA
has presented the Company with penalty calculations of $5.6 million.
