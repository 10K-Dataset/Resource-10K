                 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS OR INFORMATION
                                     
This  Form  10-K  includes certain statements that  may  be  deemed  to  be
"forward-looking  statements" within the meaning of the Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform Act of 1995. Statements in this Form 10-K which  address
activities,  events or developments that the Company expects or anticipates
will  or  may occur in the future, including such things as future  capital
expenditures (including the amount and nature thereof), expansion and other
development  trends  of industry segments in which the Company  is  active,
business  strategy,  expansion and growth of  the  Company's  business  and
operations and other such matters are forward-looking statements.  Although
the  Company  believes  the expectations expressed in such  forward-looking
statements  are based on reasonable assumptions within the  bounds  of  its
knowledge  of its business, a number of factors could cause actual  results
to   differ   materially  from  those  expressed  in  any   forward-looking
statements,  whether oral or written, made by or on behalf of the  Company.
Many  of  these  factors  have previously been  identified  in  filings  or
statements made by or on behalf of the Company.

All phases of the Company's operations are subject to influences outside
its control. Any one, or a combination, of these factors could materially
affect the results of the Company's operations. These factors include:
competitive pressures, inflation, consumer debt levels, currency exchange
fluctuations, trade restrictions, changes in tariff and freight rates,
interest rate fluctuations and other capital market conditions. Forward-
looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company are based on a
knowledge of its business and the environment in which it operates, but
because of the factors listed above, actual results may differ from those
in the forward-looking statements. Consequently, all of the forward-looking
statements made are qualified by these cautionary statements and there can
be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by the
Company will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will
have the expected consequences to or effects on the Company or its business
or operations.

ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

          (a)  General Development of Business

                Wal-Mart  Stores,  Inc.  (together  with  its  subsidiaries
hereinafter  referred  to as the "Company") is America's  largest  retailer
measured by total revenues.  During the fiscal year ended January 31, 1997,
the  Company  had  net  sales  of  $104,859,000,000.   The  Company  serves
customers  primarily  through the operation of  Wal-Mart  stores  (discount
department  stores), Sam's Clubs (warehouse membership clubs) and  Wal-Mart
Supercenters  (combination full-line supermarket  and  discount  department
stores).  Domestically, at January 31, 1997, the Company operated 1,960 Wal-
Mart  stores,  436  Sam's Clubs, and 344 Wal-Mart  Supercenters.   A  table
summarizing  information concerning domestic Wal-Mart stores, Sam's  Clubs,
Wal-Mart Supercenters and other stores operated since January 31,  1992  is
set forth in Schedule A to Item I found on page 9 of this annual report.

                In fiscal 1992, the Company entered into a joint venture in
which  it has a 50% interest with CIFRA S.A. de C.V. to develop and  expand
retailing  services  in  Mexico.   This was  the  beginning  of  Wal-Mart's
initiative  outside  of the United States.  Today,  our  joint  venture  is
Mexico's largest retailer.  At January 31, 1997, the joint venture operated
28 warehouse clubs and 18 Wal-Mart Supercenters, along with 106 CIFRA joint
venture units throughout Mexico.

                In  fiscal  1993, the Company entered Puerto  Rico  and  at
January 31, 1997, operated seven Wal-Mart stores and four Sam's Clubs.

                In  fiscal  1995, the Company acquired 122 Canadian  Woolco
department  stores from Woolworth Canada, Inc., a subsidiary  of  Woolworth
Corporation.   The acquisition included all inventory, leasehold  interests
and  other  assets  at each location.  Today Wal-Mart is  Canada's  leading
discount  retailer.  At January 31, 1997, the Company operated 136 Canadian
Wal-Mart stores.

                In  fiscal 1996, the Company entered Brazil through a joint
venture  in  which it has a 60% interest with Lojas Americanas. At  January
31,  1997,  the joint venture operated two Wal-Mart Supercenters and  three
warehouse clubs in the greater-Sao Paulo area.

                Also  in fiscal 1996, the Company entered Argentina and  at
January  31, 1997, operated three Wal-Mart Supercenters and three warehouse
clubs in the greater-Buenos Aires region.

               In fiscal 1997, the Company entered the People's Republic of
China.  At  January 31, 1997, the Company operated one Wal-Mart Supercenter
along  with joint-venture partner Shenzhen International Trust & Investment
Company  and one warehouse club along with joint-venture partner,  Shenzhen
Economic Zone Development Company.

                In  fiscal  1997, the Company entered Indonesia  through  a
franchise  agreement. At January 31, 1997, Wal-Mart operated  two  Wal-Mart
Supercenters in the Jakarta area.

                A  table  summarizing information concerning  international
units operated since fiscal 1992 is set forth in Schedule B to Item 1 found
on page 10 of this annual report.


          (b)  Financial Information About Industry Segments

                Sales  of merchandise through stores which include Wal-Mart
stores,  Sam's  Clubs  and Wal-Mart Supercenters is  the  only  significant
industry segment of which the Company is a part.  For the financial results
of  the Company's operations, see the information incorporated by reference
in Item 7 and Item 8 of Part II found on page 14 of this annual report.


          (c)  Narrative Description of Business

                The  Company,  a  Delaware corporation, has  its  principal
offices in Bentonville, Arkansas.  Although the Company was incorporated in
October  1969, the businesses conducted by its predecessors began  in  1945
when  Sam  M.  Walton  opened  a franchise Ben Franklin  variety  store  in
Newport, Arkansas.  In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar
store  in  Versailles,  Missouri.  Until 1962, the Company's  business  was
devoted  entirely to the operation of variety stores.  In  that  year,  the
first  Wal-Mart  Discount  City was opened.  In fiscal  1984,  the  Company
opened  its first three Sam's Clubs, and in fiscal 1988, its first Wal-Mart
Supercenter.   Through  the years, the Company has made  certain  strategic
acquisitions  that have supported the growth of the Wal-Mart stores,  clubs
and  Supercenters;  such as the acquisition of ten  full-service  and  four
specialty distribution centers through the purchase of McLane Company, Inc.
which  sells and distributes merchandise to the convenience store  industry
and  a  variety of other retailers; the acquisition of selected  assets  of
Pace  Membership  Warehouse, Inc. and the acquisition  of  selected  assets
related  to  122  Canadian  Woolco stores from Woolworth  Canada,  Inc.,  a
subsidiary of Woolworth Corporation.

           General.  The Company operates Wal-Mart stores in all 50 states.
The  average  size of a Wal-Mart store is approximately 92,600 square  feet
with  store sizes generally ranging between 30,000 and 150,000 square  feet
of  building area.  The Company operates Wal-Mart Supercenter stores in  23
states, and the average size of a Supercenter store is 183,300 square feet.

           The Company operates Sam's Clubs in 48 states.  The average size
of  a  Sam's  Club  is approximately 121,200 square feet,  and  club  sizes
generally range between 90,000 and 150,000 square feet of building area.

           The  Company operates Wal-Mart stores, Sam's Clubs and  Wal-Mart
Supercenters in Argentina, Canada and Puerto Rico, and under joint  venture
or franchise agreements in Brazil, China, Indonesia and Mexico.

           During  the  last fiscal year, no single store or club  location
accounted for as much as 1% of sales or net income.

           Merchandise.   Wal-Mart stores are generally organized  with  40
departments and offer a wide variety of merchandise, including apparel  for
women,  girls,  men, boys and infants.  Each store also  carries  curtains,
fabrics  and  notions,  candy,  stationery and  books,  shoes,  housewares,
hardware,  electronics,  home  furnishings,  small  appliances,  automotive
accessories,  horticulture and accessories, sporting goods,  toys,  cameras
and supplies, health and beauty aids, pharmaceuticals and jewelry.

           Nationally  advertised merchandise accounts for  a  majority  of
sales  in  the stores.  The Company markets lines of merchandise under  the
store  brands  "Sam's  American  Choice",  "Great  Value",  "Ol'  Roy"  and
"Equate".   The  Company also markets lines of merchandise  under  licensed
brands; some of which include "Faded Glory", "Kathie Lee", "Better Homes  &
Gardens", "White Stag", "McKids", "Popular Mechanics" and "Catalina".

           During the fiscal year ended January 31, 1997, domestic sales of
general  merchandise at Wal-Mart stores and Supercenters (which are subject
to  seasonal variance), including licensed departments, by product category
were as follows:


                                              PERCENTAGE
          CATEGORY                             OF SALES

          Softgoods/domestics..............        25%
          Hardgoods........................        25
          Stationery and candy.............        11
          Pharmaceuticals..................        10
          Records and electronics..........         9
          Sporting goods and toys..........         8
          Health and beauty aids...........         8
          Shoes............................         2
          Jewelry..........................         2
                                                  100%


           Sales in pharmaceuticals are a combination of owned and licensed
departments.    While   these  percentages  include   sales   of   licensed
departments,  the  Company  records only  the  rentals  received  from  the
licensee as other income.

           Sam's  offers bulk displays of name brand hardgood  merchandise,
some  softgoods  and  institutional size grocery items.   Each  Sam's  also
carries  jewelry, sporting goods, toys, tires, stationery and books.   Most
clubs have fresh food departments which include bakery, meat and produce.

          McLane offers a wide variety of grocery and non-grocery products,
including  perishable  and non-perishable items.  The non-grocery  products
consist  primarily  of tobacco products, hardgood merchandise,  health  and
beauty  aids, toys and stationery.  McLane is a wholesale distributor  that
sells  its  merchandise to a variety of retailers, including the  Company's
Wal-Mart stores, Supercenters and Sam's Clubs.

           Operations.   Except for extended hours during  certain  holiday
seasons,  the  majority of the Wal-Mart stores are open from 9:00  a.m.  to
9:00  p.m.  six days a week, and from 12:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.  on  Sundays,
with  the  remainder of the stores being closed on Sunday.   An  increasing
number of Wal-Mart stores and almost all of the Supercenter stores are open
24  hours each day.  Wal-Mart stores maintain uniform prices, except  where
lower  prices are necessary to meet local competition.  Sales are primarily
on  a  self-service, cash-and-carry basis with the objective of  maximizing
sales volume and inventory turnover while minimizing expenses.  Bank credit
card  programs, operated without recourse to the Company, are available  in
all stores.  During the year, the Company launched a co-branded credit card
program  through Chase Manhattan Bank.  This card is also operated  without
recourse  to  the  Company.  Wal-Mart stores and  Supercenters  maintain  a
"satisfaction  guaranteed"  program  to  promote  customer   goodwill   and
acceptance.

           Sam's  Clubs  are  membership only,  cash-and-carry  operations.
However,  a  financial  service  credit card  program  (Discover  Card)  is
available  in  all clubs and the "Sam's Direct" commercial finance  program
and  "Business  Revolving  Credit"  are available  to  qualifying  business
members.  Also, a "Personal Credit" program is available to qualifying club
members.   Any credit issued under these programs are without  recourse  to
the Company.  Club members include businesses and those individuals who are
members  of certain qualifying organizations, such as government and  state
employees  and credit union members.  Both business and individual  members
have an annual membership fee of $25 for the primary membership card.

           Operating  hours vary among Sam's Clubs, but they are  generally
open  Monday  through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.  Most  Sam's  are
open Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and on Sunday from 11:00 a.m.  to
6:00 p.m.

           Distribution.  During the 1997 fiscal year, approximately 84% of
the  Wal-Mart  stores' and Supercenters' purchases were shipped  from  Wal-
Mart's  34  distribution centers, five located in both Arkansas and  Texas;
two  in  California,  Florida, Indiana, Mississippi,  New  York  and  South
Carolina;  and  one  each  in  Alabama, Colorado,  Georgia,  Iowa,  Kansas,
Kentucky,  New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin.
The  balance  was  shipped  directly to the stores  from  suppliers.   Each
distribution  center  is  designed  to  serve  the  distribution  needs  of
approximately 80 to 140 stores, depending on the size of the  center.   The
size  of  these distribution centers ranges from approximately  700,000  to
1,600,000  square  feet.   Sam's  Clubs  receive  the  majority  of   their
merchandise  via  direct  shipment from  suppliers  rather  than  from  the
Company's distribution centers.

            The  McLane  distribution  centers  buy,  sell  and  distribute
merchandise,  primarily  to the convenience store industry  and  they  also
service  Wal-Mart stores, Supercenters and Sam's Clubs.  The McLane Company
has  19 distribution centers with two located in Arizona, California, Texas
and  Virginia,  and  one  each  in Colorado,  Florida,  Georgia,  Illinois,
Kentucky,  Mississippi,  Missouri,  New  York,  North  Carolina,  Utah  and
Washington.

           Merchandising.   Substantially all purchasing and  merchandising
for  all  stores is controlled from the home offices of the Company through
centralized buying and planning practices.  During the fiscal year 1997, no
single supplier accounted for more than 4.6% of the Company's purchases.

           Store  Management.  Every retail outlet is managed  by  a  store
manager  or  club general manager and one or more assistant store  or  club
managers.  The  Company  is  committed to  ongoing  training  programs  for
managers, assistant managers and department managers in an effort to assure
well trained future store management.

           Fiscal 1998 Expansion Plans. Domestically, the Company plans  to
open   approximately   50  new  Wal-Mart  stores  and   100   Supercenters.
Approximately  70  of  the new Supercenters will come from  relocations  or
expansions  of  existing Wal-Mart stores.  The Company also plans  to  open
five  to  ten  new Sam's Clubs and four distribution centers. International
expansion  includes  30 to 35 new Wal-Mart stores, Supercenters  and  Sam's
Clubs  in  Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Indonesia, Mexico  and  Puerto
Rico.  The Company expenses its start-up costs for each new unit during the
first  full  month  of operation.  Delays may be experienced  in  projected
opening  dates because of construction problems, weather and other reasons.
There can be no assurance that planned expansion will proceed as scheduled.

           Seasonal  Aspects  of  Operations.  The  Company's  business  is
seasonal  to  a  certain extent.  Generally, the highest  volume  of  sales
occurs in the fourth fiscal quarter and the lowest volume occurs during the
first fiscal quarter.

           Competition.  The Company's Wal-Mart stores compete  with  other
discount, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, many of which are
national chains.  Sam's Clubs compete with wholesale clubs, as well as with
discount  retailers, wholesale grocers and general merchandise  wholesalers
and distributors.  The Wal-Mart Supercenters compete with other supercenter-
type  stores, discount stores, supermarkets and specialty stores,  many  of
which are national or regional chains.  The Company also competes with  the
other  stores  for new store sites.  As of January 31, 1997, based  on  net
sales,  the  Company ranked first among all retail department store  chains
and among all discount department store chains.

          The Company's competitive position within the industry is largely
determined by its ability to offer value and service to its customers.  The
Company  has  many programs designed to meet the competitive needs  of  its
industry.   These  include the "Everyday Low Price", "Item  Merchandising",
"Store-Within-a-Store", "Our Business is Saving Your  Business  Money"  and
"Buy  America" programs.  Although the Company believes it has had a  major
influence  in  most of the retail markets in which its stores are  located,
there is no assurance that this will continue.

           Employees (Associates).  As of January 31, 1997, the Company had
approximately  728,000  associates, an  increase  of  approximately  53,000
associates  for  the  year.   Part-time  associates  are  primarily   sales
personnel.  Most associates participate in incentive programs which provide
the  opportunity to receive addition compensation based upon the  Company's
productivity or profitability.

          The Company maintains profit sharing plans under which most full-
and  many part-time associates participate following one year of employment
with the Company.  Annual contributions, based on the profitability of  the
Company,  are made at the sole discretion of the Company.  For  the  fiscal
years  ended  January  31, 1992 through 1997, the Company  has  contributed
approximately   $130,000,000,  $166,000,000,  $166,000,000,   $175,000,000,
$204,000,000 and $247,000,000, respectively.

           The  Company also offers an associate stock ownership plan  that
provides  for the voluntary purchase of the Company's common stock  with  a
15% match by the Company on up to $1,800 of annual stock purchases.

The  Company  also  has stock option plans that provide certain  management
associates an opportunity to share in the long-term success of the Company.
At  January  31, 1997, approximately 7,000 management associates  had  been
awarded stock options by the Company.

ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES

            The  number  and  location  of  Wal-Mart  stores,  Supercenters  and
Sam's  Clubs  is  incorporated  by reference to  the  table  under  the  caption
"Fiscal  1997  End  of  Year Store Counts" on Page 19 of the  Annual  Report  to
Shareholders for the year ended January 31, 1997.

            The  Company  owns  1,232  properties  on  which  domestic  Wal-Mart
stores  and  Supercenters  are  located and  280  of  the  properties  on  which
domestic  Sam's  are  located.   In  some  cases,  the  Company  owns  the  land
associated  with  leased  buildings.   New buildings,  both  leased  and  owned,
are constructed by independent contractors.

           The  remaining  buildings  in which its present  stores  are  located
are  either  leased  from a commercial property developer,  leased  pursuant  to
a  sale/leaseback  arrangement  or  leased  from  a  local  governmental  entity
through   an  industrial  revenue  bond  transaction.   All  of  the   Company's
leases  for  its  stores provide for fixed annual rentals and,  in  many  cases,
the leases provide for additional rent based on sales volume.

           The  Company  operated  34 Wal-Mart distribution  facilities  and  19
