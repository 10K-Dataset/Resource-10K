                 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS OR INFORMATION
                                     
      This  Form 10-K includes certain statements that may be deemed to  be
"forward-looking  statements" within the meaning of the Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform  Act  of 1995. Statements included  or  incorporated  by
reference   in  this  Form  10-K  which  address  activities,   events   or
developments that the Company expects or anticipates will or may  occur  in
the future, including such things as future capital expenditures (including
the  amount and nature thereof), expansion and other development trends  of
industry  segments  in  which  the Company is  active,  business  strategy,
expansion  and  growth of the Company's business and operations  and  other
such  matters are forward-looking statements. Although the Company believes
the expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements are based  on
reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its  business,
a  number  of factors could cause actual results to differ materially  from
those expressed in any forward-looking statements, whether oral or written,
made  by or on behalf of the Company. Many of these factors have previously
been  identified  in  filings or statements made by or  on  behalf  of  the
Company.

     All  phases  of  the  Company's operations are subject  to  influences
outside  its  control. Any one, or a combination, of  these  factors  could
materially  affect the results of the Company's operations.  These  factors
include: the cost of goods, competitive pressures, inflation, consumer debt
levels,  currency  exchange fluctuations, trade  restrictions,  changes  in
tariff  and  freight rates, interest rate fluctuations  and  other  capital
market  conditions. Forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of  the
Company  are  based on a knowledge of its business and the  environment  in
which  it operates, but because of the factors listed above, actual results
may  differ from those in the forward-looking statements. Consequently, all
of  the  forward-looking statements made are qualified by these  and  other
cautionary statements and there can be no assurance that the actual results
or  developments anticipated by the Company will be realized  or,  even  if
substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequences to or
effects on the Company or its business or operations.





                           WAL-MART STORES, INC.
                          FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT
                    FOR THE YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 1998
                                     
                                  PART I
                                     
ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

      Wal-Mart  Stores,  Inc.  (together with its subsidiaries  hereinafter
referred  to  as  the  "Company") is the United  States'  largest  retailer
measured by total revenues.  During the fiscal year ended January 31, 1998,
the Company had net sales of $117,958,000,000.

          (a)  Historical Development of Business

           Domestically,  at January 31, 1998, the Company  operated  1,921
discount  stores  and  441  Supercenters, and 443  Sam's  Clubs.   A  table
summarizing  information concerning additions of units and  square  footage
for  domestic  discount stores, Supercenters and Sam's Clubs since  January
31,  1993,  is included as Schedule A to Item I found on page  11  of  this
annual report.

           During  fiscal  1998,  a  merger of the  Mexican  joint  venture
companies owned by the Company and Cifra, S.A. de C.V. ("Cifra")  with  and
into  Cifra  was consummated with an effective merger date of September  1,
1997.   The  Company received voting shares of Cifra equaling approximately
33.5%  of  the  outstanding  voting shares of Cifra  in  exchange  for  the
Company's  joint venture interests.  The Company then acquired  593,100,000
shares  of  the  Series "A" Common Shares and Series "B" Common  Shares  of
Cifra  in a cash tender offer. As a result of the merger and tender  offer,
the  Company  holds approximately 51% of the outstanding voting  shares  of
Cifra.  The results of operations for Cifra since the effective merger date
are  included  in  the Company's results.  Prior to the merger,  the  joint
venture units controlled by the Company were consolidated while those units
controlled by Cifra were accounted for under the equity method.  See Note 6
of  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference in
Item  8  of  Part II found on page 16 of this annual report for  additional
information  regarding  our  acquisitions.   At  January  31,  1998,  Cifra
operated  28  warehouse  clubs, 27 Supercenters, 36 Superamas  (traditional
supermarkets),  62  Bodegas  (discount stores),  33  Aurreras  (combination
stores  including  both  general merchandise  and  grocery),  38  Suburbias
(specialty department stores) and 178 Vips (restaurants) throughout Mexico.

           In  fiscal  1998,  the  Company's  subsidiary,  Wal-Mart  Brasil
Participacoes S.A. acquired the 40% interest of its minority joint  venture
partner,  Lojas Americanas S.A.(Lojas). On the same day that  the  minority
interest  was  acquired, a 5% minority interest was sold to Carlos  Alberto
Sicupira,  a  principal  in  Banco de Investimentos  Garantia  S.A.,  which
indirectly controls Lojas, at the same price per share at which Lojas  sold
its  minority  interest.  Because the transaction closed  on  December  30,
1997,  which was the joint venture's fiscal year end, the Company's results
of  operations  for fiscal 1998 include only the financial results  of  the
joint  venture attributable to the Company's original ownership percentage.
See  Note  6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated  by





reference  in Item 8 of Part II found on page 16 of this annual report  for
additional information regarding our acquisitions.

           In  fiscal  1998, the Company along with joint-venture  partner,
Dongguan  Donghu  Industrial Corporation, added one unit  in  the  People's
Republic of China.  With the addition of this unit, at January 31, 1998, we
operated three units under various joint venture agreements in the People's
Republic of China.

           In  fiscal  1998, the Company acquired the Wertkauf  hypermarket
chain  in  Germany,  as  well  as certain real  estate.   The  21  acquired
hypermarkets are one-stop shopping centers that offer a broad assortment of
high  quality general merchandise and food and are similar to the  Wal-Mart
Supercenter format in the United States. The transaction closed on December
30,  1997,  Wertkauf's fiscal year end. Therefore, the acquired assets  are
included  in  the  January 31, 1998, consolidated  balance  sheet  and  the
results of operations will be included beginning in fiscal 1999. See Note 6
of  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference in
Item  8  of  Part II found on page 16 of this annual report for  additional
information  regarding our acquisitions. At January 31, 1998,  the  Company
operated 21 hypermarkets in Germany.

           Internationally, at January 31, 1998, we operated nine units  in
Argentina,  eight  units  in Brazil, 144 units in Canada,  three  units  in
China,  21  units  in Germany, 402 units in Mexico and 14 units  in  Puerto
Rico.   A  table summarizing information concerning additions of units  and
square  footage  for  international units operated  since  fiscal  1993  is
included as Schedule B to Item 1 found on page 12 of this annual report.

          (b)  Financial information about the Company's industry segments

           The  Company  is  principally engaged in the operation  of  mass
merchandising  stores  which  serve our  customers  primarily  through  the
operation of three segments.

           In  June  1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board  (FASB)
issued Statement No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise  and
Related  Information," which the Company has adopted in the  current  year.
We  identify  our  segments based on management responsibility  within  the
United States and geographically for all international units.  The Wal-Mart
Stores  segment includes the Company's discount stores and Supercenters  in
the United States. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership
clubs  in  the  United  States.  The  international  segment  includes  all
operations in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Mexico and  Puerto
Rico.   For the financial results of the Company's operating segments,  see
Note  9  of  Notes  to  Consolidated Financial Statements  incorporated  by
reference in Item 8 of Part II found on page 16 of this annual report.

          (c)  Narrative Description of Business

          The Company, a Delaware corporation, has its principal offices in
Bentonville,  Arkansas.  Although the Company was incorporated  in  October
1969,  the businesses conducted by its predecessors began in 1945 when  Sam
M.  Walton  opened  a  franchise Ben Franklin  variety  store  in  Newport,





Arkansas.  In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in
Versailles,  Missouri.   Until  1962, the Company's  business  was  devoted
entirely to the operation of variety stores.  In that year, the first  Wal-
Mart  Discount  City  (discount store) was opened.   In  fiscal  1984,  the
Company  opened its first three Sam's Clubs, and in fiscal 1988, its  first
Wal-Mart   Supercenter  (combination  full-line  supermarket  and  discount
store).   In  fiscal  1992,  the  Company  began  its  first  international
initiative when the Company entered into a joint venture in which it had  a
50%  interest  with  Cifra.  Our international presence  has  continued  to
expand  and  at  January 31, 1998, we had operations in six  countries  and
Puerto Rico.

WAL-MART STORES OPERATING SEGMENT

          The Wal-Mart Stores segment which includes the Company's discount
stores  and Supercenters in the United States had sales of $83,820,000,000,
$74,840,000,000 and $66,271,000,000 for the three years ended  January  31,
1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively. During the most recent fiscal year,  no
single discount store or Supercenter location accounted for as much  as  1%
of  total  Company sales or net income. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements incorporated by reference in Item 8 of Part  II  found
on  page 16 of this annual report for additional information regarding  our
segments.

           General.  We operate Wal-Mart discount stores in all 50  states.
The  average size of a discount store is approximately 93,400 square  feet.
Wal-Mart  Supercenters are located in 28 states and the average size  of  a
Supercenter  is  182,200 square feet. Our Supercenter prototypes  range  in
size from 110,000 square feet to 234,000 square feet.

            Merchandise.    Wal-Mart  discount  stores  and   the   general
merchandise  area  of  the  Supercenters are generally  organized  with  40
departments and offer a wide variety of merchandise, including apparel  for
women,  girls,  men, boys and infants.  Each store also carries  domestics,
fabrics  and  notions,  stationery and books, shoes, housewares,  hardware,
electronics,  home  furnishings, small appliances, automotive  accessories,
horticulture   and  accessories,  sporting  goods,  toys,  pet   food   and
accessories,  cameras and supplies, health and beauty aids, pharmaceuticals
and  jewelry.  In  addition,  the stores offer  an  assortment  of  grocery
merchandise,  with  the  assortment  in  Supercenters  being  broader   and
including meat, produce, deli, bakery, dairy, frozen foods and dry grocery.

           Nationally  advertised merchandise accounts for  a  majority  of
sales  in the stores. The Company markets lines of merchandise under  store
brands  including but not limited to "Sam's American Choice", "One Source",
"Great  Value", "Ol' Roy" and "Equate". The Company also markets  lines  of
merchandise  under  licensed brands; some of which include  "Faded  Glory",
"Kathie  Lee", "White Stag", "Better Homes & Gardens", "Popular Mechanics",
"Catalina", "McKids", "Basic Equipment" and "House Beautiful".





           During the fiscal year ended January 31, 1998, sales in discount
stores and Supercenters (which are subject to seasonal variance) by product
category were as follows:
                                              PERCENTAGE
          CATEGORY                             OF SALES

                                                  100%

           Operations.  Hours of operations vary by location, but generally
range from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. six days a week, and from 10:00 a.m.  to
8:00 p.m. on Sunday for discount stores and Supercenters.  In addition,  an
increasing number of discount stores and almost all of the Supercenters are
open 24 hours each day.  Wal-Mart discount stores and Supercenters maintain
uniform  prices,  except  where lower prices are necessary  to  meet  local
competition.   Sales are primarily on a self-service, cash-and-carry  basis
with  the objective of maximizing sales volume and inventory turnover while
minimizing expenses.  Bank credit card programs, operated without  recourse
to the Company, are available in all stores.

           Seasonal  Aspects of Operations.  The Wal-Mart Stores  operating
segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent.  Generally, the highest
volume  of sales occurs in the fourth fiscal quarter and the lowest  volume
occurs during the first fiscal quarter.

           Competition.   Our discount stores compete with other  discount,
department, drug, variety and specialty stores, many of which are  national
chains.  The  Wal-Mart  Supercenters compete  with  other  supercenter-type
stores,  discount stores, supermarkets and specialty stores, many of  which
are  national  or regional chains.  As of January 31, 1998,  based  on  net
sales, the Wal-Mart Stores segment ranked first among all retail department
store chains and among all discount department store chains.

          The Company's competitive position within the industry is largely
determined by its ability to offer value and service to its customers.  The
Company  has  many programs designed to meet the competitive needs  of  its
industry.  These include "Everyday Low Price", "Item Merchandising", "Store-
Within-a-Store" and "Buy America" programs.  Although the Company  believes
it  has  had a major influence in most of the retail markets in  which  its
stores are located, there is no assurance that this will continue.

           Distribution.  During the 1998 fiscal year, approximately 83% of
the Wal-Mart discount stores' and Supercenters' purchases were shipped from





Wal-Mart's 38 distribution centers, seven of which are grocery distribution
centers. The balance of merchandise purchased was shipped directly  to  the
stores   from  suppliers.  The  38  centers  are  located  throughout   the
continental United States. Five distribution centers are located in each of
Arkansas  and  Texas; three in South Carolina; two in each  of  California,
Florida,  Indiana, Mississippi and New York; and one in  each  of  Alabama,
Colorado,  Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, New Hampshire,  North
Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin. Each
distribution  center serves the distribution needs of approximately  80  to
100  stores,  depending  on  the size of the  center.  The  size  of  these
distribution centers ranges from approximately 600,000 to 1,700,000  square
feet.

SAM'S CLUB OPERATING SEGMENT

           The  Sam's  Club segment which includes the warehouse membership
clubs  in  the  United States had sales of $20,668,000,000, $19,785,000,000
and  $19,068,000,000 for the three years ended January 31, 1998, 1997,  and
1996,  respectively.  During the most recent fiscal year,  no  single  club
location accounted for as much as 1% of total Company sales or net  income.
See  Note  9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated  by
reference  in Item 8 of Part II found on page 16 of this annual report  for
additional information regarding our segments.

           General.  The  Company operates Sam's Clubs in 48  states.   The
average size of a Sam's Club is approximately 120,900 square feet, and club
sizes  generally range between 90,000 and 150,000 square feet  of  building
area.

           Merchandise.  Sam's offers bulk displays of name brand  hardgood
merchandise,  some  softgoods and institutional size grocery  items.   Each
Sam's  also carries software and electronic goods, jewelry, sporting goods,
toys,  tires, stationery and books.  Most clubs have fresh food departments
which include bakery, meat and produce.

          Operations.  Operating hours vary among Sam's Clubs, but they are
generally  open  Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:30  p.m.   Most
Sam's  are  open  Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and on  Sunday  from
11:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.

           Sam's  Clubs  are  membership only,  cash-and-carry  operations.
However,  a  financial  service  credit card  program  (Discover  Card)  is
available  in  all clubs and the "Sam's Direct" commercial finance  program
and  "Business  Revolving  Credit"  are available  to  qualifying  business
members.  Also, a "Personal Credit" program is available to qualifying club
members.  Any credit issued under these programs is without recourse to the
Company.   Club  members include businesses and those individuals  who  are
members  of certain qualifying organizations, such as government and  state
employees  and  credit union members.  In fiscal 1998,  both  business  and
individual  members paid an annual membership fee of $25  for  the  primary
membership  card  with  a  spouse card available  for  an  additional  $10.
Beginning  in fiscal 1999, the annual membership fee for a business  member
increased  to  $30  for  the primary membership card  with  a  spouse  card





available  at  no  additional  cost.  The  annual  membership  fee  for  an
individual member increased to $35 for the primary membership card  with  a
spouse card available at no additional cost.

            Seasonal  Aspects  of  Operations.  The  Sam's  Club  operating
segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent.  Generally, the highest
volume  of sales occurs in the fourth fiscal quarter and the lowest  volume
occurs during the first fiscal quarter.

           Competition.  Sam's Clubs compete with warehouse clubs, as  well
as  with  discount  retailers, wholesale grocers  and  general  merchandise
wholesalers and distributors. The Company also competes with others for new
store  sites.  As of January 31, 1998, based on net sales, the  Sam's  Club
segment ranked second among all warehouse clubs.

          Distribution.  During fiscal 1998, approximately 60% of the Sam's
Club  purchases were shipped from distribution facilities, eight  of  which
are  food distribution facilities. The balance was shipped directly to  the
clubs  from  suppliers.   A  combination  of  Company  owned  and  operated
facilities  and  third-party facilities comprises the overall  distribution
structure.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATING SEGMENT

           The  International Segment includes operations of the  Company's
wholly-owned  subsidiaries in Argentina, Canada, Germany and  Puerto  Rico,
joint  ventures  in  China and majority-owned subsidiaries  in  Brazil  and
Mexico.   Sales for the three years ended January 31, 1998, 1997, and  1996
were   $7,517,000,000,  $5,002,000,000  and  $3,712,000,000,  respectively.
During  the  most recent fiscal year, no single location accounted  for  as
much  as  1% of total Company sales or net income. See Note 9 of  Notes  to
Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference in  Item  8  of
Part  II  found on page 16 of this annual report for additional information
regarding our segments.

          General.  Operating formats vary by country, but include Wal-Mart
discount  stores  in  Canada  and Puerto Rico; Supercenters  in  Argentina,
Brazil, Mexico and under joint venture agreements in China; Sam's Clubs  in
Argentina,  Brazil, Mexico, Puerto Rico and under joint venture  agreements
in  China;  Hypermarkets  in  Germany  and  Superamas,  Bodegas,  Aurreras,
Suburbias and Vips in Mexico.

           Merchandise.    The merchandising strategy in the  International
operating  segment is similar to that of domestic segments in  the  breadth
and  scope  of merchandise offered for sale.  While brand name  merchandise
accounts  for  a majority of sales, several store brands not found  in  the
United  States  have  been developed to serve customers  in  the  different
markets  in  which the International segment operates.  In addition,  steps
have been taken to develop relationships with local vendors in each country
to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise.

          Operations.  The hours of operation for operating units in the
international division vary by country and by individual markets within





countries depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of
operation.  While sales are primarily on a cash-and-carry basis, credit
cards or other consumer finance programs exist in certain markets to
facilitate the purchase of goods by the customer.

           Seasonal  Aspects  of  Operations.  The International  operating
segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent.  Generally, the highest
volume  of  sales occurs in the fourth fiscal quarter.  The seasonality  of
the  business  varies  by country due to different national  and  religious
holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different climatic conditions.

          Competition.  The International operating segment competes with a
variety of local national and international chains in the discount,
department, drug, variety, specialty and wholesale sectors of the retail
market.  The segment's competitive position is determined, to a large
extent, by its ability to offer its customers everyday low prices on
quality merchandise that offers exceptional value.  In Supercenters, our
ability to effectively operate the food departments has a major impact on
the segment's  competitive position in the markets where we operate.

            Distribution.    The  International  segment  operates   export
consolidation  facilities  in  Miami,  Florida;  Seattle,  Washington;  and
Laredo,  Texas in support of product flow to its Mexican, Asian, and  Latin
American  markets.   In addition, distribution facilities  are  located  in
Argentina,  Brazil, Canada, China and Mexico which process  and  flow  both
imported  and domestic product to the operating units.  Operationally,  the
principle  focus  is  on  crossdocking product,  while  maintaining  stored
inventory  is  minimized.   During fiscal 1998, approximately  70%  of  the
International  merchandise  purchases  flowed  through  these  distribution
facilities.  The balance was shipped directly to the stores from suppliers.
A  combination  of  Company owned and operated facilities  and  third-party
facilities  comprises the overall distribution  structure for International
logistics.
