WAL-MART STORES, INC.

ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2002

PART I

ITEM 1

.

BUSINESS

General.

We are the world’s largest retailer as measured by total revenues.
During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2002, we had net sales of $217.8 billion. We
maintain our principal offices at 702 S.W. 8

th

Street, Bentonville, Arkansas
72716.

Although Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in October
1969, the businesses conducted by our predecessors began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened
a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James
L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our
predecessors’ business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In
that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, was opened. In
fiscal 1984, we opened our first three SAM’S Clubs, and in fiscal 1988, our first
Wal-Mart Supercenter, a format that combines a full-line supermarket with a general
merchandise discount store. We currently operate in all 50 states in the United States.

In fiscal 1992, we began our first international initiative when we
entered into a joint venture in Mexico, in which we had a 50% interest, with Cifra S.A. de
C.V. In fiscal 1998, we acquired the controlling interest in Cifra as described below, and
in February 2000, Cifra officially changed its name to Wal-Mart de Mexico, S.A. de C.V.
Since fiscal 1992, our international presence has continued to expand and at January 31,
2002, we had international operations in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Germany, South Korea,
Mexico, Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom and, through joint venture agreements, in
China.

The Development of Our Company in Recent Years.

At January 31, 2002, we operated in the United States, 1,647 discount
stores, 1,066 Supercenters, 500 SAM’S Clubs and 31 Neighborhood Markets.
Internationally, at January 31, 2002, the Company operated units in Argentina (11), Brazil
(22), Canada (196), Germany (95), South Korea (9) Mexico (551), Puerto Rico (17) and the
United Kingdom (250), and, under joint venture agreements, in China (19). Our growth,
measured both by our net sales and net income, occurs in large measure as a result of the
increase in the number of stores we have, both in the United States and internationally,
and the increase from year to year of the sales in our existing stores. The following
tables provide summary information concerning the additions of units and square footage
for domestic discount stores, Supercenters, SAM’S Clubs, Neighborhood Markets and
international units in each of our fiscal years from 1997 through 2002.

INTERNATIONAL NET SQUARE FOOTAGE GROWTH

YEARS ENDED JANUARY 31, 1997 THROUGH 2002

Fiscal 2002 net additions contain an adjustment to the previously
reported square footage based on a reassessment of the various foreign country totals.
This adjustment has been made to state the total square footage amounts at January 31,
2002. The adjustments made on an individual country basis are: for Canada a reduction of
21,506 square feet, for China an increase of 27,849 square feet, for Germany an increase
of 4,419,932 square feet, for South Korea an increase of 300,645 square feet, for Mexico
an increase of 4,293,932 square feet and for the United Kingdom an increase of 134,088
square feet. No adjustments were made to the square footage previously reported in
Argentina, Brazil and Puerto Rico as a result of the reassessment.

Much of our growth internationally in recent years has resulted from
our acquisition of existing operations in various countries. In the third quarter of
fiscal 1998, we acquired approximately 51% of the voting shares in Wal-Mart de Mexico,
which was formerly known as "Cifra," by means of a tender offer pursuant to
which we acquired a total of 593,100,000 shares of Wal-Mart de Mexico’s voting stock
and a merger of certain joint ventures between us and Wal-Mart de Mexico into Wal-Mart de
Mexico. We acquired another 1,609,000,000 shares of Wal-Mart de Mexico’s voting stock
pursuant to that merger. We paid a total of approximately US$1.2 billion for the shares of
Cifra voting stock acquired in the tender offer. In fiscal 2001, we purchased an
additional 271.3 million shares of stock in Wal-Mart de Mexico from other shareholders of
Wal-Mart de Mexico at a cost of approximately $587 million. As a result of that
acquisition and Wal-Mart de Mexico’s share repurchase program, we hold approximately
61.4% of the outstanding voting shares of Wal-Mart de Mexico at the end of fiscal 2002.

Page 8 of 23

In the third quarter of fiscal, 2000, we acquired all of the stock of
ASDA Group PLC, the third largest retailer in the United Kingdom, for a purchase price of
approximately US$11 billion. ASDA had 229 stores at the time of the acquisition. The
acquisition of ASDA marked our entry into the United Kingdom.

We announced on March 14, 2002, that we intend to acquire 6.1% of the
stock of The Seiyu Ltd., a Japanese retail chain, for 6 billion yen, or approximately $46
million based on an exchange rate of 130 yen per United States dollar. Under the terms of
the proposed acquisition, we will also have the right to contribute up to 260 billion yen,
or approximately $2 billion, based on the exchange rate discussed above, for additional
shares of stock in Seiyu. If we contribute the full 260 billion yen to Seiyu, we will own
approximately 66.7% of the stock of Seiyu. This transaction is subject to the approval of
Seiyu’s stockholders and other approvals. In addition, in February 2002, we also
announced that we intend to acquire 35 Supermercado Amigo supermarkets in Puerto Rico.
That acquisition is subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals.

We have provided additional information regarding the accounting
treatment of certain of the acquisitions discussed above in Note 6 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, which appear in our Annual Report to Shareholders, are
incorporated by reference herein and have been included as an exhibit to this annual
report.

Our Industry Segments

Our mass merchandising operations serve our customers primarily through
the operation of three segments. We identify those segments based on management
responsibility within the United States and geographically for all international units.
The Wal-Mart Stores segment includes our discount stores, Supercenters and Neighborhood
Markets in the United States. The SAM’S Club segment includes the warehouse
membership clubs in the United States. The International segment includes all of our
operations in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Korea, Mexico, Puerto Rico and
the United Kingdom. We do not treat the operations of our subsidiary, McLane Company, Inc.
("McLane"), as a separate operating segment as a result of the size of its
operations relative to the other segments of our business, but show its results of
operations under the heading "Other" in our segment financial data. McLane
provides products and distribution services to retail industry and institutional food
services customers. You will find information concerning the financial results of our
operating segments and the total assets of each of those segments in Note 9 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have incorporated our Consolidated Financial
Statements as of January 31, 2002 and for the year then ended and the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements by reference herein to our Annual Report to our
Shareholders and included them as an exhibit to this annual report.

Wal-Mart Stores Operating Segment.

The Wal-Mart Stores segment had
net sales of $139.1 billion, $121.9 billion and $108.7 billion for the three fiscal years
ended January 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. During the most recent fiscal year,
no single discount store or Supercenter location accounted for as much as 1% of total
Company sales or net income. We have provided additional information about the Wal-Mart
Stores segment in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations,
which we have incorporated by reference herein and has been included as an exhibit to this
annual report. In addition, you should read Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, which we have incorporated by reference herein and which contain additional
information regarding our operating segments.

General.

The Company operates Wal-Mart discount stores in all
50 states. Discount stores range in size from 30,000 square feet to 158,000 square feet,
with the average size of a discount store being approximately 95,741 square feet. Wal-Mart
Supercenters are located in 43 states. Supercenters range in size from 90,000 square feet
to 246,000 square feet, with the average size of a Supercenter being approximately 185,218
square feet.. The Company operates Neighborhood Market stores in Arkansas, Oklahoma and
Texas. Neighborhood Market stores range in size from 40,000 square feet to 64,000 square
feet, with the average size being 45,742 square feet.

Merchandise

.

Wal-Mart discount stores and the general
merchandise area of the Supercenters are generally organized with 40 departments and offer
a wide variety of merchandise, including apparel for women, girls, men, boys and infants.
Each store also carries domestics, fabrics and notions, stationery and books, shoes,
housewares, hardware, electronics, home furnishings, small appliances, automotive
accessories, horticulture and accessories, sporting goods, toys, pet food and accessories,
cameras and supplies, health and beauty aids, pharmaceuticals and jewelry. In addition,
the stores offer an assortment of grocery merchandise, with the grocery assortment in
Supercenters being broader and including meat, produce, deli, bakery, dairy, frozen foods
and dry grocery.

Page 9 of 23

Nationally advertised merchandise accounts for a majority of sales in
the stores. We market lines of merchandise under store brands including "Sam’s
American Choice," "One Source," "Great Value," "Ol’
Roy," "Puritan," and "Equate." The Company also markets lines of
merchandise under licensed brands, some of which include "Faded Glory,"
"General Electric," "Stanley," "White Stag,"
"Catalina" and "McKids."

During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2002, sales in discount stores
and Supercenters (which are subject to seasonal variance) by product category were as
follows:

Operations

.

Hours of operation for nearly all
Supercenters and an increasing number of discount stores are 24 hours each day. Hours of
operation for the remaining discount stores vary by location, but generally range from
7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m., six days a week, and from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. on Sundays.
Wal-Mart discount stores and Supercenters maintain uniform prices, except where lower
prices are necessary to meet local competition. Sales are primarily on a self-service,
cash-and-carry basis with the objective of maximizing sales volume and inventory turnover
while minimizing expenses. Bank credit card programs, operated without recourse to the
Company, are available in all stores.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations

.

The Wal-Mart Stores
operating segment’s business is seasonal to a certain extent. Generally, our highest
volume of sales occurs in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday season,
and the lowest volume occurs during its first fiscal quarter.

Competition

.

Our Wal-Mart discount stores compete with
other discount, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, many of which are national
chains. Our Wal-Mart Supercenters compete with other supercenter-type stores, discount
stores, supermarkets and specialty stores, many of which are national or regional chains.
We also compete with others for new store sites. As of January 31, 2002, based on net
sales, the Wal-Mart Stores segment ranked first among all retail department store chains
and among all discount department store chains.

Our ability to offer value and service to our customers largely
determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We employ many programs
designed to meet the competitive pressures within our industry. These include our
"Everyday Low Price", "Item Merchandising",
"Store-Within-a-Store" "Price Rollbacks", and "Store of the
Community" programs. Although we believe we have had a major influence in most of the
retail markets in which our stores are located, we cannot assure you that this influence
will continue.

Distribution

.

During fiscal 2002, approximately 84% of
the Wal-Mart discount stores’ and Supercenters’ purchases of merchandise were
shipped from Wal-Mart’s 72 distribution centers of which 32 are general merchandise
distribution centers, 20 are grocery distribution centers, eight are clothing distribution
centers, and nine are specialty distribution centers. The specialty distribution centers
ship items such as jewelry, tires and optical. The balance of merchandise purchased was
shipped directly to the stores from suppliers. Additionally, the Company operates three
import distribution centers in the United States. The 72 distribution centers are located
throughout the continental United States. Eight distribution centers are located in each
of Arkansas and Georgia; seven in Texas; five in Indiana; four in California; three in
each of New York and South Carolina; two in each of Alabama, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Montana, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Wisconsin; and one in each of
Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Mexico,
North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon and Virginia. During fiscal 2002, Wal-Mart.com
utilized two third-party distribution centers and one located in Utah and one in Ohio to
fulfill orders for goods placed through its website.

Sam’s Club Operating Segment.

The SAM’S Club segment had
net sales of $29.4 billion, $26.8 billion and $24.8 billion for the three fiscal years
ended January 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. During the most recent fiscal year,
no single club location accounted for as much as 1% of total Company sales or net income.
We have provided additional information the SAM’S Club segment in Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations, which appears in our Annual Report to
Shareholders, is incorporated by reference herein and has been included as an exhibit to
this annual report. In addition, you should read Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, which we have incorporated by reference herein, which contain
additional information regarding each of our operating segments.

General

.

We operate SAM’S Clubs in 48 states.
SAM’S Clubs facility sizes generally range between 90,000 and 190,000 square feet of
building area, with the average SAM’S Club facility being approximately 123,558
square feet.

Merchandise

.

SAM’S Clubs offer bulk displays of name
brand hardgood merchandise, some softgoods and institutional size grocery items, and
selected items under the "Member’s Mark" store brand. Generally, each
SAM’S Club also carries software, electronic goods, jewelry, sporting goods, toys,
tires, stationery and books. Most clubs have fresh food departments, which include bakery,
meat and produce. In addition, some clubs offer one-hour photo, embroidery departments,
pharmaceuticals, optical departments and gasoline stations.

During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2002, sales in the SAM’s
Clubs segment, which are subject to seasonal variance, by product category were as
follows:

Operations

.

Operating hours vary among SAM’S Clubs,
but are generally Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., Saturday from 9:30
a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Sunday from 11:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.

SAM’S Clubs are membership only, cash-and-carry operations.
However, a financial service credit card program, the Discover Card, is available in all
clubs and we make the "SAM’S Direct" commercial finance program and
"Business Revolving Credit" available to qualifying business members. Also, we
make a "Personal Credit" program available to qualifying club members. All
credit extended to members under these programs is without recourse to us. Club members
include businesses and those individuals who are members of certain qualifying
organizations, such as federal and state government employees and credit union members. In
fiscal 2002, business members paid an annual membership fee of $30 for the primary
membership card with a spouse card available at no additional cost. The annual membership
fee for an individual member is $35 for the primary membership card with a spouse card
available at no additional cost. SAM’S Clubs Elite Membership program offers
additional benefits and services such as automotive extended service contracts, roadside
assistance, home improvement, auto brokering, and pharmacy discounts in addition to the
regular suite of benefits including SAM'S CLUB Travel Services, Boat and RV Program and
Mail Order Pharmacy. The annual membership fee for an Elite Member is $100.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations

.

The SAM’S Club operating
segment’s business is seasonal to a certain extent. Generally, its highest volume of
sales occurs in the Company’s fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday
season, and the lowest volume occurs during its first fiscal quarter.

Competition

.

SAM’S Clubs compete with other
warehouse clubs, as well as with discount retailers, wholesale grocers and general
merchandise wholesalers and distributors. We also compete with others for new club sites.
As of January 31, 2002, based on domestic U.S. net sales, the SAM’S Club segment
ranked first among all warehouse clubs. Our ability to offer low prices and quality
merchandise determines our competitive position in the warehouse club industry.

Page 11 of 23

Distribution

.

During fiscal 2002, approximately 62.2% of
the SAM’S Club purchases were shipped from the SAM’S Clubs segment’s
dedicated distribution facilities. Suppliers shipped the balance of the SAM’s Club
purchases directly to the SAM’S Clubs’ locations. The principal focus of our
SAM’s Clubs’ distribution operations is on crossdocking product, while stored
inventory is minimized. A combination of six Company owned and operated facilities and 13
third-party owned and operated facilities constitute the overall distribution structure
for the SAM’s Club segment. Two of the Company owned and operated facilities are
located in Texas with one located in each of Arkansas, Colorado, Minnesota and Indiana. Of
the third party owned and operated facilities, one of each is located in each of Arizona,
California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, North
Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington. Additionally, the SAM’S Club segment is
serviced by 12 Wal-Mart owned freezer/cooler facilities which service both Wal-Mart stores
and SAM’S Clubs, two Wal-Mart owned specialty distribution facilities which service
both Wal-Mart stores and SAM’S Clubs and one third-party owned freezer/cooler
facility.

International Operating Segment.

Our International Segment
comprises our operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries in Argentina, Canada, Germany,
South Korea, Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom; our operations through majority-owned
subsidiaries in Brazil and Mexico and our operations through joint ventures in China. The
International segment’s net sales for the three fiscal years ended January 31, 2002,
2001 and 2000, were $35.5 billion, $32.1 billion and $22.7 billion, respectively. During
the most recent fiscal year, no single location accounted for as much as 1% of total
Company sales or net income. We have provided additional information about the
International segment in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of
Operations, which appears in our Annual Report to Shareholders, is incorporated by
reference herein and has been included as an exhibit to this annual report. In addition,
you should read Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which we have
incorporated by reference herein, which contains additional information regarding our
operating segments.

General

.

Operating formats vary by country, but include
Wal-Mart discount stores in Canada and Puerto Rico; Supercenters in Argentina, Brazil,
China, Germany, South Korea, Mexico and the United Kingdom; SAM’S Clubs in Brazil,
China, Mexico, and Puerto Rico; Superamas (traditional supermarket), Bodegas (discount
store), Suburbias (specialty department store) and Vips (restaurant) in Mexico; Todo Dias
(traditional supermarket) in Brazil; Neighborhood Markets (traditional supermarkets) in
South Korea and ASDA stores (combination grocery and apparel store) in the United Kingdom.

Merchandise

.

The merchandising strategy for the
International operating segment is similar to that of domestic segments in the breadth and
scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a
majority of sales, several store brands not found in the United States have been developed
to serve customers in the different markets in which the International segment operates.
In addition, steps have been taken to develop relationships with local suppliers in each
country to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise.

Operations

.

The hours of operation for operating units in
the International segment vary by country and by individual markets within countries,
depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. While sales are
primarily on a cash-and-carry basis, credit cards or other consumer finance programs exist
in certain markets to facilitate the purchase of goods by the customer.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations

.

The International
operating segment’s business is seasonal to a certain extent. Generally, the highest
volume of sales occurs in the Company’s fourth fiscal quarter. The seasonality of the
business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and
customs, as well as different climatic conditions.

Competition

.

The International operating segment competes
with a variety of local, national and international chains in the discount, department,
drug, variety, specialty and wholesale sectors of the retail market in each of the
countries in which we operate and, in Mexico, with local, national and international
restaurant chains. Our ability to offer our customers low prices on quality merchandise
that offers exceptional value in the international segment determines, to a large extent,
our competitive position. In our international Supercenters, our ability to effectively
operate the food departments has a major impact on the segment’s competitive position
in the markets where we operate.

Page 12 of 23

Distribution.

The International segment operates export
consolidation facilities in Los Angeles, California; Jacksonville, Florida; and Laredo,
Texas in support of product flow to its Mexican, Asian, and Latin American markets. We
operate a total of 35 distribution facilities that are located in Argentina, Brazil,
Canada, China, Germany, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom and Mexico. Through these
facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic product to the operating
units. During fiscal 2002, approximately 71% of the International merchandise purchases
flowed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the balance of the
International segment’s merchandise purchases directly to our stores in the various
countries in which we operate. A combination of Company

owned and
operated facilities and third-party facilities makes up the overall distribution structure
for International logistics.

Other Operations.

The sales reported in the "Other"
category result from sales to third parties by McLane. McLane, which is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., is a wholesale distributor that sells its merchandise
to a variety of retailers, primarily in the convenience store and food service industries.
McLane also services Wal-Mart discount stores, Supercenters, Neighborhood Markets and
SAM’S Clubs. McLane offers a wide variety of grocery and non-grocery products,
including perishable and non-perishable items. The non-grocery products consist primarily
of tobacco products, general merchandise, health and beauty aids, toys and stationery.
McLane’s net sales for the three fiscal years ended January 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000
were $13.8 billion, $10.5 billion and $8.8 billion, respectively.

During fiscal 2002, McLane operated 18 grocery distribution facilities,
17 of which we owned and one of which we leased. These grocery distribution facilities are
located as follows: two in each of California and Texas, and one each in Arizona, Alabama,
Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New
York, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington. Additionally, McLane operated 17
foodservice distribution facilities, one of which we owned and 16 of which we leased.
These foodservice distribution facilities are located as follows: two or each in
California and Texas and one in each of Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kansas,
Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Virginia and Wisconsin.

Employees (Associates).

As of January 31, 2002, the Company employed approximately 1,383,000
associates worldwide, with approximately 1,080,000 associates in the United States and
303,000 associates in foreign countries. Most associates participate in incentive
programs, which provide the opportunity to receive additional compensation based upon the
Company’s productivity or profitability.

to Shareholders for the year ended January 31, 2002, which information we have included as
an exhibit to this annual report.

We own 1,680 of the properties on which our domestic discount
stores, Neighborhood Markets and Supercenters are located and 331 of the properties on
which our domestic SAM’S Clubs are located. In some cases, we own the land associated
with leased buildings in which our discount stores, Neighborhood Markets, Supercenters and
SAM’S Clubs are located.

We either lease the remaining buildings in which our present domestic
locations are located from a commercial property developer, pursuant to a sale/leaseback
arrangement or from a local governmental entity in connection with an industrial revenue
bond financing arrangement. All of our leases of our stores provide for fixed annual
rentals and, in many cases, the leases provide for additional rent based on sales volume.

We use independent contractors to construct the new buildings, both
leased and owned, that we build.

Domestically, we operated 72 Wal-Mart distribution facilities and 35
McLane distribution facilities as of January 31, 2002. With the exception of the 16 leased
McLane foodservice distribution facilities, we primarily own these distribution
facilities, several of which are subject to mortgages granted to secure loans obtained to
finance their development. We also lease some of the distribution facilities under
industrial development bond financing arrangements that provide us with the option to
purchase those facilities at the end of the lease term for nominal amounts.

We own the office facilities in Bentonville, Arkansas that serve as our
home office and corporate headquarters and an office facility in Temple, Texas that serves
as the home office for McLane. We lease an office facility in Brisbane, California that
serves as the home office for Wal-Mart.com

We operate our International segment stores and restaurants in a
combination of owned and leased properties in each country in which our International
segment operates. We own 9 properties in Argentina, 14 properties in Brazil, 23 properties
in Canada, one property in China through joint venture, 19 properties in Germany, 9
properties in South Korea, 247 properties in Mexico, five properties in Puerto Rico and
165 properties in the United Kingdom in which the operating units are located, with the
remaining units in each country being leased. We utilize both owned and leased properties
for office facilities in each country in which we are conducting business. Outside the
United States, we utilized 35 distribution facilities as of January 31, 2002. Of these 35
distribution facilities, we owned nine and leased 17. Third parties own the remaining nine
distribution facilities.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are not a party to nor are any of our properties subject to any
material pending legal proceeding other than routine litigation incidental to the
Company’s business.

We recently opened a Supercenter in
Honesdale, Pennsylvania. In February 1999, we settled claims made by the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection (PDEP) that a subcontractor’s acts and
omissions relating to the construction of the Supercenter led to excess erosion and
sedimentation of a nearby creek. In the settlement, we agreed to pay a fine of $25,000 and
to perform a $75,000 community environmental project in the Honesdale area. We are
negotiating a settlement of a claim by the United States Army Corps of Engineers that the
construction resulted in the filling of approximately 0.76 acres in excess of the
permitted fill area of waters and wetlands at the site. The proposed settlement with the
Corps of Engineers would require us to pay $200,000 to a non-profit corporation for the
purchase of local wetlands conservation areas and easements. The contractor on the project
has reimbursed us for the amounts we have paid in connection with this matter.

During fiscal 2001, the State of
Connecticut filed suit against us in the State of Connecticut Superior Court for the
Judicial District of Hartford alleging various violations of state environmental laws and
alleging that we failed to obtain the appropriate permits or maintain required records
relating to storm water management practices at 12 stores. The suit seeks to ensure our
compliance with the general permit for the discharge of stormwater associated with those
stores. We intend to vigorously defend against these allegations.
