Narrative Description of
Business

The Company, a Delaware corporation, has its principal offices in
Bentonville, Arkansas. Although the Company was incorporated in October 1969, the businesses conducted by its predecessors began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother,
James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, the Company's business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City (a discount store) was opened. In fiscal
1984, the Company opened its first three SAM'S Clubs, and in fiscal 1988, its first Wal-Mart Supercenter (a combination full-line supermarket and discount store). In fiscal 1992, the Company began its first international initiative when the Company
entered into a joint venture in which it had a 50% interest with Cifra S.A. de C.V. (Cifra). In fiscal 1998, the Company acquired the controlling interest in Cifra, and in February 2000, Cifra officially changed its name to Wal-Mart de Mexico, S.A.
de C.V. The Company's international presence has continued to expand and at January 31, 2001, the Company had international operations in eight countries and Puerto Rico.

$108,721,000,000 and $95,395,000,000 for the three fiscal years ended January 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single discount store or Supercenter location accounted for as much as 1% of total Company
sales or net income. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference in Item 8 of Part II, found on page 20 of this annual report for additional information regarding our operating segments.

General.

The Company operates Wal-Mart discount stores
in all 50 states. The average size of a discount store is approximately 95,262 square feet. Discount stores range in size from 30,000 square feet to 155,000 square feet. Wal-Mart Supercenters are located in 40 states and
the average size of a Supercenter is approximately 183,106 square feet. Supercenters range in size from 108,000 square feet to 241,000 square feet. The Company operates Neighborhood Market stores in Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas. Neighborhood Market
stores range in size from 40,000 square feet to 64,000 square feet with an average size of approximately 47,271 square feet. Wal-Mart.com is a majority-owned subsidiary of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. with offices in Brisbane, California and was formed in
fiscal 2000 to further develop the Company's e-commerce initiatives and internet business.

Merchandise.

Wal-Mart discount stores and the general
merchandise area of the Supercenters are generally organized with 40 departments and offer a wide variety of merchandise, including apparel for women, girls, men, boys and infants. Each store also carries domestics, fabrics and notions, stationery
and books, shoes, housewares, hardware, electronics, home furnishings, small appliances, automotive accessories, horticulture and accessories, sporting goods, toys, pet food and accessories, cameras and supplies, health and beauty aids,
pharmaceuticals and jewelry. In addition, the stores offer an assortment of grocery merchandise, with the grocery assortment in Supercenters being broader and including meat, produce, deli, bakery, dairy, frozen foods and dry grocery.

Nationally advertised merchandise accounts for a majority of sales in the
stores. The Company markets lines of merchandise under store brands including but not limited to "Sam's American Choice", "One Source", "Great Value", "Ol' Roy" "Puritan", and "Equate". The
Company also markets lines of merchandise under licensed brands, some of which include "Faded Glory", "Kathie Lee", "White Stag, "Popular Mechanics", "Catalina" and "McKids".

During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2001, sales in discount stores
and Supercenters (which are subject to seasonal variance) by product category were as follows:

Operations.

Hours of operation for nearly all
Supercenters and an increasing number of discount stores are 24 hours each day. Hours of operation for the remaining discount stores vary by location, but generally
range from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m., six days a week, and from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. on Sundays. Wal-Mart discount stores and Supercenters maintain uniform prices, except where lower prices are necessary to meet local competition. Sales are
primarily on a self-service, cash-and-carry basis with the objective of maximizing sales volume and inventory turnover while minimizing expenses. Bank credit card programs, operated without recourse to the Company, are available in all
stores.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations.

The Wal-Mart Stores
operating segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Generally, the highest volume of sales occurs in the Company's fourth fiscal quarter and the lowest volume occurs during its first fiscal quarter.

Competition.

Wal-Mart discount stores compete with
other discount, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, many of which are national chains. Wal-Mart Supercenters compete with other supercenter-type stores, discount stores, supermarkets and specialty stores, many of which are national or
regional chains. The Company also competes with others for new store sites. As of January 31, 2001, based on net sales, the Wal-Mart Stores segment ranked first among all retail department store chains and among all discount department store
chains.

The Company's competitive position within the industry is largely
determined by its ability to offer value and service to its customers. The Company has many programs designed to meet the competitive pressures within its industry. These include the Company's "Everyday Low Price", "Item
Merchandising", "Store-Within-a-Store" "Price Rollbacks", and "Store of the Community" programs. Although the Company believes it has had a major influence in most of the retail markets in which its stores are
located, there is no assurance that this influence will continue.

Distribution.

During fiscal 2001, approximately 84% of
the Wal-Mart discount stores' and Supercenters' purchases were shipped from Wal-Mart's 55 distribution centers, 16 of which are grocery distribution centers, and three of which are import distribution centers. The balance of merchandise purchased
was shipped directly to the stores from suppliers. The 55 distribution centers are located throughout the continental United States. Six distribution centers are located in Texas; five in each of Arkansas and Georgia; four in New York; three in
South Carolina; two in each of Alabama, California, Florida, Indiana, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin; and one in each of Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina,
Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon and Tennessee. During fiscal 2001, Wal-Mart.com utilized two third party distribution centers, one in Utah and one in Ohio to fulfill orders for goods placed through its website.

SAM'S CLUB OPERATING SEGMENT

The SAM'S Club segment had sales of $26,798,000,000, $24,801,000,000 and
$22,881,000,000 for the three fiscal years ended January 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. During the most recent
fiscal year, no single club location accounted for as much as 1% of total Company sales or net income. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference in Item 8 of Part II found on page 20 of this annual report for
additional information regarding our segments.

General.

The Company operates SAM'S Clubs in 48 states.
The average size of a SAM'S Club is approximately 122,107 square feet, and club sizes generally range between 90,000 and 160,000 square feet of building area.

Merchandise

.

SAM'S Clubs offer bulk displays of name
brand hardgood merchandise, some softgoods and institutional size grocery items, and selected items under the "Member's Mark" store brand. Generally each SAM'S Club also carries software, electronic goods, jewelry, sporting goods, toys,
tires, stationery and books. Most clubs have fresh food departments, which include bakery, meat and produce. In addition, some clubs offer one-hour photo, embroidery departments, pharmaceuticals, optical departments and gas stations.

During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2001, sales in the clubs (which
are subject to seasonal variance) by product category were as follows:

Operations.

Operating hours vary among SAM'S Clubs, but
they are generally open Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Sunday from 11:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.

SAM'S Clubs are membership only, cash-and-carry operations. However, a
financial service credit card program (Discover Card) is available in all clubs and the "SAM'S Direct" commercial finance program and "Business Revolving Credit" are available to qualifying business members. Also, a
"Personal Credit" program is available to qualifying club members. Any credit extended to members under these programs is without recourse to the Company. Club members include businesses and those individuals who are members of certain
qualifying organizations, such as federal and state government employees and credit union members. In fiscal 2001, business members paid an annual membership fee of $30 for the primary membership card with a spouse card available at no additional
cost. The annual membership fee for an individual member is $35 for the primary membership card with a spouse card available at no additional cost. SAM'S Clubs Elite Membership program offers additional benefits such as long distance service,
roadside assistance, internet access, home improvement,
Telebank, business insurance and financial planning, auto brokering, pharmacy discounts, and entertainment savings guides. The annual membership fee for an Elite Member is $100.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations.

The SAM'S Club
operating segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Generally, the highest volume of sales occurs in the Company's fourth fiscal quarter and the lowest volume occurs during its first fiscal quarter.

Competition.

SAM'S Clubs compete with other warehouse
clubs, as well as with discount retailers, wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors. The Company also competes with others for new club sites. As of January 31, 2001, based on domestic U.S. net sales, the SAM'S Club
segment ranked first among all warehouse clubs.

Distribution.

During fiscal 2001, approximately 59% of
the SAM'S Club purchases were shipped from the Segment's distribution facilities. The balance was shipped directly to the clubs location from suppliers. The principal focus of SAM's Clubs distribution operations is on crossdocking product, while
stored inventory is minimized. A combination of 6 Company owned and operated facilities and 17 third-party owned and operated facilities constitute the overall distribution structure for the SAM's Club segment. Two of the Company owned and operated
facilities are located in Texas with one located in each of Arkansas, Colorado, Minnesota and Indiana. Of the third party owned and operated facilities, two are located in each of Illinois and Pennsylvania and one in each of Arizona, California,
Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas and Washington.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATING SEGMENT

The Company's International Segment comprises the Company's wholly owned
operations in Argentina, Canada, Germany, Korea, Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom; operations through joint ventures in China; and of operations through majority-owned subsidiaries in Brazil and Mexico. The International Segment's sales for the
three fiscal years ended January 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, were $32,100,000,000, $22,728,000,000 and $12,247,000,000, respectively. Sales for the United Kingdom operation during fiscal 2001 and 2000 were $14,500,000,000 and $7,200,000,000,
respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single location accounted for as much as 1% of total Company sales or net income. At January 31, 2001 and 2000, International segment long lived assets, primarily plant, property and equipment and
goodwill, totaled $19,400,000,000 and $19,600,000,000 of which $12,400,000,000 and $13,100,000,000, respectively were held in the United Kingdom. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference in Item 8 of Part II
found on page 20 of this annual report for additional information regarding our segments.

General.

Operating formats vary by country, but include Wal-Mart discount stores in Canada and Puerto Rico;
Supercenters in Argentina, Brazil, China, Korea, Mexico and the United Kingdom; SAM'S Clubs in Brazil, China, Mexico, and Puerto Rico; Hypermarkets in Germany; Superamas (traditional supermarket), Bodegas (discount store), Aurreras (combination
store), Suburbias (specialty department store) and Vips (restaurant) in Mexico and ASDA stores (combination grocery and apparel store) in the United Kingdom.

Merchandise.

The merchandising strategy for the International operating segment is similar to that of domestic
segments in the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of sales, several store brands not found in the United States have been developed to serve customers in the different markets in
which the International segment operates. In addition, steps have been taken to develop relationships with local vendors in each country to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise.

Operations.

The hours of operation for operating units in the international division vary by country and by
individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. While sales are primarily on a cash-and-carry basis, credit cards or other consumer finance programs exist in certain markets to
facilitate the purchase of goods by the customer.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations.

The International operating segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent.
Generally, the highest volume of sales occurs in the Company's fourth fiscal quarter. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different climatic
conditions.

Competition.

The International operating segment competes with a variety of local, national and international chains in
the discount, department, drug, variety, specialty and wholesale sectors of the retail market. The segment's competitive position is determined, to a large extent, by its ability to offer its customers low prices on quality merchandise that offers
exceptional value. In Supercenters, our ability to effectively operate the food departments has a major impact on the segment's competitive position in the markets where we operate.

Distribution.

The International segment operates export consolidation facilities in Los Angeles, California;
Jacksonville, Florida; Seattle, Washington; and Laredo, Texas in support of product flow to its Mexican, Asian, and Latin American markets. 37 distribution facilities are located in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Puerto Rico, the United
Kingdom and Mexico. Through these facilities the Company processes and distributes both imported and domestic product to the operating units. During fiscal 2001, approximately 70% of the International merchandise purchases flowed through these
distribution facilities. The balance was shipped directly to the stores from suppliers. A combination of Company

owned and operated facilities and third-party facilities comprises the overall distribution structure for International logistics.

OTHER

The sales reported in the "Other" category result from sales to third parties by McLane. McLane is a wholly-owned wholesale distributor
that sells its merchandise to a variety of retailers, primarily in the convenience store industry. McLane also services Wal-Mart discount stores, Supercenters, Neighborhood Markets and SAM'S Clubs. McLane offers a wide variety of grocery and
non-grocery products, including perishable and non-perishable items. The non-grocery products consist primarily of tobacco products, general merchandise, health and beauty aids, toys and stationery. Segment sales for the "Other" segment
for the three fiscal years ended January 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $10,542,000,000, $8,763,000,000 and $7,111,000,000 respectively.

During fiscal 2001, McLane acquired substantially all of the business and domestic distribution assets of AmeriServe Food Distribution, Inc.
(AmeriServe). AmeriServe is a leading distributor of food and restaurant supply products to the quick service food industry. The acquisition was not significant to the Company's financial position or results of operations for fiscal 2001. However,
included in the acquisition were 17 leased distribution centers. These distribution centers are located two each in California and Texas and one in each of Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina,
Tennessee, Oregon, Virginia and Wisconsin. Also, during fiscal 2001 McLane operated 16 grocery distribution centers. These distribution centers are located as follows: two in each of California and Texas, and one each in Arizona, Alabama, Colorado,
Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.

PROPERTIES

The number and location of domestic and international Wal-Mart discount stores, Supercenters and SAM'S
Clubs is incorporated by reference to the table under the caption "Fiscal 2001 End of Year Store Counts" on page 6 of the Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended January 31, 2001.

The Company owns 1,380 of the properties on which domestic discount stores
and Supercenters are located and 282 of the properties on which domestic SAM'S Clubs are located. In some cases, the Company owns the land associated with leased buildings. New buildings, both leased and owned, are constructed by independent
contractors.

The remaining buildings in which its present domestic locations are located are either leased from a
commercial property developer, leased pursuant to a sale/leaseback arrangement or leased from a local governmental entity through an industrial revenue bond transaction. All of the Company's leases for its stores provide for fixed annual rentals
and, in many cases, the leases provide for additional rent based on sales volume.

Domestically, the Company operated 55 Wal-Mart distribution facilities and 33 McLane distribution
facilities as of January 31, 2001. With the exception of the AmeriServe facilities, the Company primarily owns these distribution facilities, and several are subject to mortgages granted to secure loans. Some of the distribution facilities are
leased under industrial development bond financing arrangements and provide the option of purchasing these facilities at the end of the lease term for nominal amounts.

The Company owns office facilities in Bentonville, Arkansas that serve as the home office for the
Company and an office facility in Temple, Texas which serves as the home office for McLane.

Internationally, the Company has a combination of owned and leased
properties in each country in which the operating units are located. The Company owns eight properties in Argentina, 13 properties in Brazil, 14 properties in Canada, one property in China through joint venture, 19 properties in Germany, six
properties in Korea, 212 properties in Mexico, four properties in Puerto Rico and 158 properties in the United Kingdom in which the operating units are located, with the remaining units in each country being leased.

The Company utilizes both owned and leased properties for office
facilities in each country in which it conducts business.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is not a party to any material pending legal proceedings.
Neither the Company nor any of its properties is subject to
any material pending legal proceeding, other than routine litigation incidental to the Company's business.

The Company recently opened a Supercenter in Honesdale, Pennsylvania. In February 1999, the
Company settled claims made by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PDEP) that a subcontractor's acts and omissions relating to the construction of the Supercenter led to excess erosion and sedimentation of a nearby creek. In the
settlement, the Company agreed to pay a fine of $25,000 and to perform a $75,000 community environmental project in the Honesdale area. The Company is negotiating settlement of a claim by the United States Army Corps of Engineers that the
construction resulted in the filling of approximately 0.76 acres in excess of the permitted fill area of waters and wetlands at the site. The proposed settlement with the Corps will require the Company to pay $200,000 to a non-profit corporation for
the purchase of local wetlands conservation areas and easements. The Company has been reimbursed for these amounts by the contractor on the project.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is threatening to bring suit against
the Company and five of its contractors over alleged violations of a 1992 storm water permit issued with respect to various Wal-Mart development sites in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. The EPA has presented the Company with penalty calculations of
$5.6 million.

During the fiscal 2001, the State of Connecticut filed suit against the Company in the State
of Connecticut Superior Court for the Judicial District of Hartford for various violations of state environmental laws alleging the Company failed to adequately permit and or maintain records relating to storm water management practices at 12
stores. The suit seeks to ensure the Company's compliance with the general permit for the discharge of stormwater associated with those stores. The Company will vigorously defend against these allegations.
