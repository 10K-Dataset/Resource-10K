WAL-MART STORES, INC.

ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2003

PART I

ITEM 1

.

BUSINESS

General.

We are the world’s largest retailer
as measured by total revenues. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2003, we had net
sales of $244.5 billion. We maintain our principal offices at 702 S.W. 8

th

Street, Bentonville, Arkansas 72716.

Although Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. was
incorporated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our predecessors
began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport,
Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles,
Missouri. Until 1962, our predecessors’ business was devoted entirely to the
operation of variety stores. In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a
discount store, was opened. In fiscal 1984, we opened our first three SAM’s CLUBs,
and in fiscal 1988, our first Wal-Mart Supercenter, a format that combines a full-line
supermarket with a general merchandise discount store. We currently operate in all 50
states in the United States.

In fiscal 1992, we began our first
international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico, in which we had a
50% interest, with Cifra S.A. de C.V. In fiscal 1998, we acquired the controlling interest
in Cifra as described below, and in February 2000, Cifra officially changed its name to
Wal-Mart de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. Since fiscal 1992, our international presence has
continued to expand and at January 31, 2003, we had international operations in Argentina,
Brazil, Canada, Germany, South Korea, Mexico, Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom, through
joint venture agreements, in China and through a minority investment in Japan.

The Development of Our Company in Recent Years.

At January 31, 2003, we operated in the
United States, 1,568 discount stores, 1,258 Supercenters, 525 SAM’s CLUBs and 49
Neighborhood Markets. Internationally, at January 31, 2003, the Company operated units in
Argentina (11), Brazil (22), Canada (213), Germany (94), South Korea (15), Mexico (597),
Puerto Rico (52) and the United Kingdom (258), and, under joint venture agreements, in
China (26). Additionally, we hold, on a fully diluted basis, a 35% interest in The Seiyu,
Ltd., a Japanese retail chain.

Our growth, measured both by our net
sales and net income, occurs in large measure as a result of the increase in the number of
stores we have, both in the United States and internationally, and the increase from year
to year of the sales in our existing stores. The following tables provide summary
information concerning the additions of units and square footage for domestic discount
stores, Supercenters, SAM’s CLUBs, Neighborhood Markets and international units in
each of our fiscal years from 1999 through 2003.

INTERNATIONAL NET SQUARE FOOTAGE GROWTH

YEARS ENDED JANUARY 31, 1999 THROUGH 2003

* Includes Amigo’s square footage of 821,917 in fiscal 2003.

Fiscal 2002 net additions contain an
adjustment to the previously reported square footage based on a reassessment of the
various foreign country totals. This adjustment has been made to state the total square
footage amounts at January 31, 2002. The adjustments made on an individual country basis
are: for Canada a reduction of 21,506 square feet, for China an increase of 27,849 square
feet, for Germany an increase of 4,419,932 square feet, for South Korea an increase of
300,645 square feet, for Mexico an increase of 4,293,932 square feet and for the United
Kingdom an increase of 134,088 square feet. No adjustments were made to the square footage
previously reported in Argentina, Brazil and Puerto Rico as a result of the reassessment.

Much of our growth internationally in
recent years has resulted from our acquisition of existing operations in various
countries. In the third quarter of fiscal 1998, we acquired approximately 51% of the
voting shares in Wal-Mart de Mexico, which was formerly known as "Cifra," by
means of a tender offer pursuant to which we acquired a total of 593,100,000 shares of
Wal-Mart de Mexico’s voting stock and a merger of certain joint ventures between us
and Wal-Mart de Mexico into Wal-Mart de Mexico. We acquired another 1,609,000,000 shares
of Wal-Mart de Mexico’s voting stock pursuant to that merger. We paid a total of
approximately US$1.2 billion for the shares of Cifra voting stock acquired in the tender
offer. In fiscal 2001, we purchased an additional 271.3 million shares of stock in
Wal-Mart de Mexico from other shareholders of Wal-Mart de Mexico at a cost of
approximately $587 million. As a result of that acquisition, Wal-Mart de Mexico’s
share repurchase program and a stock dividend paid by Wal-Mart de Mexico, we held
approximately 62% of the outstanding voting shares of Wal-Mart de Mexico at the end of
fiscal 2003.

Page 8 of 26

In the third quarter of fiscal, 2000, we
acquired all of the stock of ASDA Group PLC, the third largest retailer in the United
Kingdom, for a purchase price of approximately US$11 billion. ASDA had 229 stores at the
time of the acquisition. The acquisition of ASDA marked our entry into the United Kingdom.

In December 2002, the Company exercised
in full the first in the series of warrants we had acquired that allow us to acquire
192,800,000 new shares in Seiyu for approximately $432 million. After this exercise, our
ownership percentage in Seiyu increased to approximately 35% on a fully diluted basis. If
we exercise all of the warrants we acquired at a cost of 260 billion yen or $2.1 billion
at an exchange rate of 124 yen per U.S. dollar, we will own approximately 66.7% of the
stock of Seiyu. Also, in December 2002, the Company completed its purchase of
Supermercados Amigo, Inc. (Amigo), a supermarket chain located in Puerto Rico with 37
supermarkets at the time of the acquisition. Four of the supermarkets were subsequently
sold, and two are currently in the process of being sold.

We have provided additional information regarding the accounting
treatment of certain of the acquisitions discussed above in Note 6 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, which appear in our Annual Report to Shareholders, are
incorporated by reference herein and have been included as an exhibit to this annual
report.

Our Industry Segments

Our mass merchandising operations
serve our customers primarily through the operation of three segments. We identify those
segments based on management responsibility within the United States and geographically
for all international units. The Wal-Mart Stores segment includes our discount stores,
Supercenters and Neighborhood Markets in the United States. The SAM’s CLUB segment
includes the warehouse membership clubs in the United States. The International segment
includes all of our operations in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Japan, Germany, Korea,
Mexico, Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom. We do not treat the operations of our
subsidiary, McLane Company, Inc. ("McLane"), as a separate operating segment as
a result of the size of its operations relative to the other segments of our business, but
show its results of operations under the heading "Other" in our segment
financial data. McLane provides products and distribution services to retail industry and
institutional food services customers. You will find information concerning the financial
results of our operating segments and the total assets of each of those segments in Note
11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Results of Operations. We have incorporated our Consolidated Financial
Statements as of January 31, 2003 and for the year then ended and the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements by reference herein to our Annual Report to our
Shareholders and included them as an exhibit to this annual report, as well as
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations.

Wal-Mart Stores Operating Segment

The Wal-Mart Stores segment had net sales
of $157.1 billion, $139.1 billion and $121.9 billion for the three fiscal years ended
January 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no
single discount store, Supercenter or Neighborhood Market location accounted for as much
as 1% of total Company sales or net income.

General

We
operate Wal-Mart discount stores in all 50 states. Discount stores range in size from
30,000 square feet to 219,000 square feet, with the average size of a discount store being
approximately 96,883 square feet. Wal-Mart Supercenters are located in 43 states.
Supercenters range in size from 90,000 square feet to 261,000 square feet, with the
average size of a Supercenter being approximately 186,495 square feet. We operate
Neighborhood Market stores in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi,
Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and Utah. Neighborhood Market stores range in size from 40,000
square feet to 64,000 square feet, with the average size being 44,099 square feet.

Merchandise

Wal-Mart
discount stores and the general merchandise area of the Supercenters are generally
organized into 53 departments and offer a wide variety of merchandise. Each store carries
apparel for women, girls, men, boys and infants, domestics, fabrics and notions,
stationery and books, shoes, housewares, hardware, electronics, home furnishings, small
appliances, automotive accessories, horticulture and accessories, sporting goods, toys,
pet food and accessories, cameras and supplies, health and beauty aids, pharmaceuticals,
jewelry and optical. In addition, the stores offer an assortment of grocery merchandise,
with the grocery assortment in Supercenters being broader and including meat, produce,
deli, bakery, dairy, frozen foods and dry grocery. Neighborhood Markets are generally
organized into 35 departments, and offer dry grocery, meat, produce, deli, bakery, dairy,
frozen foods, pharmaceuticals, photo processing, health and beauty aids, household
chemicals, paper goods and pet supplies.

Page 9 of 26

Nationally advertised merchandise
accounts for a majority of sales in the stores. We market lines of merchandise under store
brands including "Sam’s American Choice," "One Source,"
"Great Value," "Ol’ Roy," "Puritan,"
"Equate," "No Boundaries," "George" and "Athletic
Works." The Company also markets lines of merchandise under licensed brands, some of
which include "Faded Glory," "General Electric," "White
Stag," "Catalina," "Mary-Kate and Ashley" and
"Starter."

During the fiscal year ended January
31, 2003, sales in discount stores and Supercenters (which are subject to seasonal
variance) by product category were as follows:

Operations

Hours
of operation for nearly all Supercenters and an increasing number of discount stores are
24 hours each day. Hours of operation for the remaining discount stores vary by location,
but generally range from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m., six days a week, and from 10:00 a.m. to
8:00 p.m. on Sundays. Wal-Mart discount stores and Supercenters maintain uniform prices,
except where lower prices are necessary to meet local competition. Sales are primarily on
a self-service, cash-and-carry basis with the objective of maximizing sales volume and
inventory turnover while minimizing expenses. Bank credit card programs, operated without
recourse to the Company, are available in all stores.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations

The
Wal-Mart Stores operating segment’s business is seasonal to a certain extent.
Generally, its highest volume of sales occurs in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes
the holiday season, and the lowest volume occurs during our first fiscal quarter.

Competition

Our
Wal-Mart discount stores compete with other discount, department, drug, variety and
specialty stores and supermarkets, many of which are national chains. Our Wal-Mart
Supercenters compete with other supercenter-type stores, discount stores, supermarkets and
specialty stores, many of which are national or regional chains. We also compete with
others for new store sites. As of January 31, 2003, based on net sales, the Wal-Mart
Stores segment ranked first among all retail department store chains and among all
discount department store chains.

Our ability to offer value and
service to our customers largely determines our competitive position within the retail
industry. We employ many programs designed to meet the competitive pressures within our
industry. These include our "Everyday Low Price,"
"Store-Within-a-Store," "Price Rollbacks," and "Store of the
Community" programs. Although we believe we have had a major influence in most of the
retail markets in which our stores are located, we cannot assure you that this influence
will continue.

Distribution

During
fiscal 2003, approximately 83% of the Wal-Mart discount stores’ and
Supercenters’ purchases of merchandise were shipped from Wal-Mart’s 84
distribution centers of which 33 are general merchandise distribution centers, 25 are
grocery distribution centers, seven are clothing distribution centers and 15 are specialty
distribution centers. The specialty distribution centers ship merchandise such as jewelry,
tires, optical, product returns, and pharmaceuticals. The balance of merchandise purchased
was shipped directly to the stores from suppliers. Additionally, the Company operates
three import distribution centers and one distribution center for online orders placed via
Wal-Mart.com. The 84 distribution centers are located throughout the continental United
States. Nine distribution centers are located in each of Arkansas and Texas; eight in
Georgia; five in Indiana; four in each of California and New York; three in each of
Florida, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania; two each in Alabama, Illinois,
Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin; and one in
each in Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Hampshire, New
Mexico, Nevada, Oklahoma, and Oregon.

SAM’s CLUB Operating Segment

The SAM’s CLUB segment had net sales
of $31.7 billion, $29.4 billion and $26.8 billion for the three fiscal years ended January
31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single club
location accounted for as much as 1% of total Company sales or net income.

General

We
operate SAM’s CLUBs in 48 states. SAM’s CLUBs facility sizes generally range
between 90,000 and 160,000 square feet of building area, with the average SAM’s CLUB
facility being approximately 125,000 square feet.

Merchandise

SAM’s
CLUB offers bulk displays of name-brand merchandise, including hardgoods, some softgoods,
institutional-size grocery items, and selected private-label items under the
"Member’s Mark" brand. Generally, each SAM’s CLUB also carries
software, electronics, jewelry, floral, sporting goods, toys, tires, stationery and books.
Most clubs have fresh departments, which include bakery, meat, produce and Sam’s
Cafe. Additionally, some clubs offer one-hour photo, pharmaceuticals, optical departments
and gasoline stations.

During the fiscal year ended January 31,
2003, sales in the SAM’s CLUBs segment, which are subject to seasonal variance, by
product category were as follows:

Operations

Operating
hours vary among SAM’s CLUBs, but are generally Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m.
to 8:30 p.m., Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Sunday from 11:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.
Additionally, all Club locations offer a Gold Key program that permits Business Members to
shop before the Clubs regular opening hours Monday through Saturday, starting at 7:00 AM.

SAM’s CLUBs are membership only,
cash-and-carry operations. However, a financial service credit card program, the Discover
Card, is available in all clubs and we make the "SAM’S Direct" commercial
finance program and "Business Revolving Credit" available to qualifying business
members. Also, we make a "Personal Credit" program available to qualifying club
members. Generally, all credit extended to members under these programs is without
recourse to the Company. Club members include businesses and those individuals who are
members of certain qualifying organizations, such as federal and state government
employees and credit union members. In fiscal 2003, business members paid an annual
membership fee of $30 for the primary membership card with a spouse card available at no
additional cost. The annual membership fee for an individual member is $35 for the primary
membership card with a spouse card available at no additional cost. SAM’sCLUBs Elite
Membership program offers additional benefits and services such as automotive extended
service contracts, roadside assistance, home improvement, auto brokering, and pharmacy
discounts in addition to the regular suite of benefits including SAM'S CLUB Travel
Services, Boat and RV Program and Mail Order Pharmacy. The annual membership fee for an
Elite Member is $100. In February 2003, the Elite Membership Program was replaced with the
SAM’S CLUB Plus membership program which provides, in addition to the services
mentioned above under the SAM’S CLUB Elite membership program, an extended array of
new services including insurance services, credit card processing, payroll processing,
dental discount networks and extended service agreements.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations

The
SAM’S CLUB operating segment’s business is seasonal to a certain extent.
Generally, its highest volume of sales occurs in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes
the holiday season, and the lowest volume occurs during our first fiscal quarter.

Competition

SAM’S
CLUBs compete with other warehouse clubs, as well as with discount retailers, wholesale
grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors. We also compete with others
for new club sites. Our ability to offer low prices and quality merchandise determines our
competitive position in the warehouse club industry.

Page 11 of 26

Distribution

During
fiscal 2003, approximately 63% of the SAM’s CLUB purchases were shipped from the
SAM’s CLUBs segment’s dedicated distribution facilities. Suppliers shipped the
balance of the SAM’s CLUB purchases directly to the SAM’s CLUBs’ locations.
The principal focus of our SAM’s CLUBs’ distribution operations is on
crossdocking product, while stored inventory is minimized. A combination of seven Company
owned and operated facilities and 12 third-party owned and operated facilities constitute
the overall distribution structure for the SAM’s CLUB segment. Two of the Company
owned and operated facilities are located in Texas with one located in each of Arizona,
Arkansas, Colorado, Minnesota and Indiana. Of the third party owned and operated
facilities, one of each is located in each of California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,
Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and
Washington. Additionally, the SAM’s CLUB segment is serviced by 12 Wal-Mart owned
freezer/cooler facilities which service both Wal-Mart stores and SAM’s CLUBs, four
Wal-Mart owned specialty distribution facilities which service both Wal-Mart stores and
SAM’s CLUBs and one third-party owned freezer/cooler facility.

International Operating Segment

Our International Segment comprises our
operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries in Argentina, Canada, Germany, South Korea,
Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom; our operations through majority-owned subsidiaries in
Brazil and Mexico; our operations through joint ventures in China and, through a minority
ownership interest, in Japan. The International segment’s net sales for the three
fiscal years ended January 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, were $40.8 billion, $35.5 billion and
$32.1 billion, respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single location
accounted for as much as 1% of total Company sales or net income.

General

Operating
formats vary by country, but include Wal-Mart discount stores in Canada and Puerto Rico;
Supercenters in Argentina, Brazil, China, Germany, South Korea, Mexico, Puerto Rico and
the United Kingdom; SAM’s CLUBs in Brazil, China, Mexico, and Puerto Rico; Superamas
(traditional supermarket), Bodegas (discount store), Suburbias (specialty department
store) and Vips (restaurant) in Mexico; Todo Dias (traditional supermarket) in Brazil;
Neighborhood Markets (traditional supermarkets) in China; ASDA stores (combination grocery
and apparel store) in the United Kingdom; and Amigo supermarkets in Puerto Rico.

Merchandise

The
merchandising strategy for the International operating segment is similar to that of
domestic segments in the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand
name merchandise accounts for a majority of sales, several store brands not found in the
United States have been developed to serve customers in the different markets in which the
International segment operates. In addition, steps have been taken to develop
relationships with local suppliers in each country to ensure reliable sources of quality
merchandise.

Operations

The
hours of operation for operating units in the International segment vary by country and by
individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances
governing hours of operation. While sales are primarily on a cash-and-carry basis, credit
cards or other consumer finance programs exist in certain markets to facilitate the
purchase of goods by the customer.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations

The
International operating segment’s business is seasonal to a certain extent.
Generally, the highest volume of sales occurs in our fourth fiscal quarter. The
seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious
holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different climatic conditions.

Competition

The
International operating segment competes with a variety of local, national and
international chains in the discount, department, drug, variety, specialty and wholesale
sectors of the retail market in each of the countries in which we operate and, in Mexico,
with local, national and international restaurant chains. Our ability to offer our
customers low prices on quality merchandise that offers exceptional value in the
international segment determines, to a large extent, our competitive position. In our
international Supercenters, our ability to effectively operate the food departments has a
major impact on the segment’s competitive position in the markets where we operate.

Distribution

The
International segment operates export consolidation facilities in Los Angeles, California;
Jacksonville, Florida; and Laredo, Texas in support of product flow to its Mexican, Asian,
and Latin American markets. We operate a total of 43 distribution facilities that are
located in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom and
Mexico. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic
product to the operating units. During fiscal 2003, approximately 76% of the International
merchandise purchases flowed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the
balance of the International segment’s merchandise purchases directly to our stores
in the various countries in which we operate. A combination of Company

owned and operated facilities and third-party facilities makes up the overall
distribution structure for International logistics.

Other Operations

The sales reported in the
"Other" category result from sales to third parties by McLane. McLane, which is
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., is a wholesale distributor that sells
its merchandise to a variety of retailers, primarily in the convenience store and food
service industries. McLane also services Wal-Mart discount stores, Supercenters,
Neighborhood Markets and SAM’s CLUBs. McLane offers a wide variety of grocery and
non-grocery products, including perishable and non-perishable items. The non-grocery
products consist primarily of tobacco products, general merchandise, health and beauty
aids, toys and stationery. McLane’s net sales for the three fiscal years ended
January 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $14.9 billion, $13.8 billion and $10.5 billion,

We either lease the
remaining buildings in which our present domestic locations are located from a commercial
property developer, or lease pursuant to a sale/leaseback arrangement or from a local
governmental entity in connection with an industrial revenue bond financing arrangement.
All of our leases of our stores provide for fixed annual rentals and, in many cases, the

We use independent contractors to

Item 103 of the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s Regulation S-K requires disclosure of any proceeding brought for the
purpose of protecting the environment to which a governmental authority is a party and in
which the potential monetary sanctions involved exceed $100,000. We are disclosing the
following items in accordance with Item 103.

In February 1999, the Company settled
claims made by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (‘PDEP’)
regarding a store in Honesdale, Pennsylvania. The PDEP alleged that a subcontractor’s
acts and omissions relating to the construction of the store led to excess erosion and
sedimentation of a nearby creek. In the settlement, the Company agreed to pay a fine of
$25,000 and to perform a $75,000 community environmental project in the Honesdale area.
The Company is negotiating a settlement of a claim by the United States Army Corps of
Engineers that the construction of the Honesdale store resulted in the filling of
approximately 0.76 acres in excess of the permitted fill area of waters and wetlands at
the site. The proposed settlement with the Corps of Engineers would require the Company to
pay $200,000 to a non-profit corporation for the purchase of local wetlands conservation
areas and easements. The contractor on the project has reimbursed the Company for the
amounts paid in connection with the settlement matter.

During fiscal 2001, the State of
Connecticut filed suit against the Company in the State of Connecticut Superior Court for
the Judicial District of Hartford alleging various violations of state environmental laws
and alleging that the Company failed to obtain the appropriate permits or failed to
maintain required records relating to storm water management practices at 12 stores. The
suit seeks to ensure the Company’s compliance with the general permit for the
discharge of stormwater associated with those stores.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

No matters were submitted to a vote of the Company’s
security holders during the last quarter of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2003.
