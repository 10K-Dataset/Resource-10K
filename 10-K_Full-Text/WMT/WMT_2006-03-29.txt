WAL-MART STORES, INC.

ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2006

PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
(“Wal-Mart” or the “Company”) operates retail stores in various formats around the world. Wal-Mart is committed to growing by improving the standard of living for our customers throughout the world. We earn the trust of our
customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at every day low prices (“EDLP”) while fostering a culture that rewards and embraces mutual respect, integrity and diversity. EDLP is our pricing
philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so that our customers trust that our prices will not change erratically under frequent promotional activity. Our fiscal year ends on January 31. During the fiscal year ended
January 31, 2006, we had net sales of $312.4 billion.

Our Wal-Mart Stores segment is the largest segment of our business, accounting
for 67.2% of our fiscal 2006 sales. This segment consists of three different traditional retail formats, all of which operate in the United States, and Wal-Mart’s online retail format, Walmart.com. Our traditional Wal-Mart Stores retail formats
include:

•

Supercenters, which average approximately 187,000 square feet in size and offer a wide assortment of general merchandise and a full-line supermarket;

•

Discount Stores, which average approximately 102,000 square feet in size and offer a wide assortment of general merchandise and a limited variety of food products; and

•

Neighborhood Markets, which average approximately 42,000 square feet in size and offer a full-line supermarket and a limited assortment of general merchandise.

Our SAM’S CLUB segment consists of membership warehouse clubs, which operate in the United States, and the
segment’s online retail format, samsclub.com. SAM’S CLUB accounted for 12.7% of our fiscal 2006 sales. Our focus for SAM’S CLUB is to provide exceptional value on brand-name merchandise at “members only” prices for both
business and personal use. Our SAM’S CLUBs average approximately 129,000 square feet in size.

At January 31, 2006, our
International segment consisted of retail operations in nine countries and Puerto Rico. This segment generated 20.1% of our fiscal 2006 sales. The International segment includes several different formats of retail stores and restaurants, including
Discount Stores, Supercenters and SAM’S CLUBs that operate outside the United States. Additionally, at January 31, 2006, we owned an unconsolidated minority interest of approximately 33.3% of Central American Retail Holding Company
(“CARHCO”), a retailer that operates more than 360 supermarkets and other stores in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. In February 2006, we acquired an additional 17.7% interest in CARHCO, to give us majority
ownership of CARHCO.

We maintain our principal offices at 702 S.W. 8th Street, Bentonville, Arkansas 72716.

The Development of Our Company

Although Wal-Mart was
incorporated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in
Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders’ business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a Discount Store, was opened. In fiscal 1984, we opened our first three
SAM’S CLUBs, and in fiscal 1988, we opened our first Supercenter. In fiscal 1999, we opened our first Neighborhood Market.

In fiscal
1992, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico, in which we owned a 50% interest along with Cifra S.A. de C.V. (“Cifra”). In fiscal 1998, we acquired the controlling interest in Cifra, and
in February 2000, Cifra officially changed its name to Wal-Mart de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. Since fiscal 1992, our international presence has continued to expand, and at January 31, 2006, we had international operations in Argentina, Brazil,
Canada, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico, South Korea and the United Kingdom. We also operate through joint ventures in China, and at January 31, 2006, owned a minority interest in CARHCO.


At January 31, 2006, we operated 1,209 Discount Stores, 1,980 Supercenters, 567 SAM’S CLUBs and
100 Neighborhood Markets in the United States. Internationally, at January 31, 2006, the Company operated units in Argentina (11), Brazil (295), Canada (278), Germany (88), Japan (398), Mexico (774), Puerto Rico (54), South Korea (16) and
the United Kingdom (315). We also operated 56 stores through joint ventures in China at January 31, 2006.

Our growth, measured both
by our net sales and net income, occurs in large measure as a result of our domestic and international expansion programs along with comparative store sales increases. For fiscal 2006 and prior years, we considered comparative store sales to be
sales at stores that were open as of February 1st of the prior fiscal year and which had not been expanded or relocated since that date. Comparative store sales are also referred to as “same-store” sales by others within the retail
industry. The method of calculating comparative store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparative store sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Beginning
in fiscal 2007, we changed our method of calculating comparative store sales. These changes are described in our Current Report on Form 8-K that we furnished to the SEC on February 2, 2006.

The following tables provide summary information concerning the additions of units and square footage for Discount Stores, Supercenters, Neighborhood
Markets and SAM’S CLUBs in the United States, and international units in each of our fiscal years from fiscal 2002 through fiscal 2006.

Much of our growth internationally in recent years has resulted from our acquisition of existing
operations in various countries. During May 2002, the Company acquired its initial 6.1% stake in The Seiyu, Ltd. (“Seiyu”), a Japanese retail chain. Through a series of transactions, our ownership percentage in Seiyu was increased to
approximately 37% at January 31, 2005. In December 2005, the Company purchased an additional interest in Seiyu, bringing our total ownership percentage in Seiyu to 53.3%, and began consolidating Seiyu as a majority-owned subsidiary.

During the past two fiscal years, we acquired two retailers in Brazil. In December 2005, we completed the purchase of Sonae Distribuição
Brasil S.A., a retail operation in Southern Brazil consisting of 139 hypermarkets, supermarkets and wholesale units. In February 2004, the Company completed its purchase of Bompreço S.A. Supermercados do Nordeste
(“Bompreço”), a supermarket chain in Northern Brazil with 118 hypermarkets, supermarkets and mini-markets.

In September
2005, the Company acquired a 33.3% interest in CARHCO, a retailer with more than 360 supermarkets and other stores in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. In February 2006, we acquired an additional 17.7% of CARHCO making us
the majority shareholder of that entity. Following our acquisition of majority ownership, CARHCO’s name was changed to Wal-Mart Centro America.

We have provided additional information regarding the accounting treatment of the acquisitions discussed above in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which appear in our Annual Report to Shareholders and
are incorporated by reference herein and have been included as an exhibit to this Annual Report.

Our Industry Segments

Our retail operations serve our customers primarily through three segments. We identify those segments based on management responsibility within the
United States and in total for international units. The Wal-Mart Stores segment includes our Supercenters, Discount Stores and Neighborhood Markets in the United States as well as Walmart.com. The SAM’S CLUB segment includes the warehouse
membership clubs in the United States as well as samsclub.com. The International segment consists of our operations in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Mexico, Puerto Rico, South Korea, the United Kingdom and, beginning in December 2005,
Japan. At January 31, 2006, our share of the results of our unconsolidated minority interest in CARHCO was not included in the International segment, but, following our February 2006 acquisition of an additional 17.7% of CARHCO, will be
included in the International segment. You will find information concerning the financial results of our operating segments and the total assets of each of those segments in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition. We have incorporated by reference herein our Consolidated Financial Statements as of January 31, 2006, and for the year then ended, the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition that are contained in our Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form
10-K.

Wal-Mart Stores Operating Segment

The Wal-Mart Stores segment had net sales of $209.9 billion, $191.8 billion and $174.2 billion for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single Supercenter,
Discount Store or Neighborhood Market location accounted for as much as 1% of total Company sales or net income.

General.

We
operate Wal-Mart Discount Stores in all 50 states, Supercenters in 47 states and Neighborhood Markets in 15 states. Our Discount Stores range in size from 30,000 square feet to 224,000 square feet, with an average size of approximately 102,000
square feet. Supercenters range in size from 99,000 square feet to 261,000 square feet, with an average size of approximately 187,000 square feet. Neighborhood Markets range in size from 38,000 square feet to 56,000 square feet, with an average size
of approximately 42,000 square feet. Customers can also access a broad assortment of merchandise and services online at www.walmart.com.

Merchandise.

Wal-Mart Discount Stores and the general merchandise area of Supercenters carry apparel for women, girls, men, boys and infants, domestics, fabrics and notions, stationery and books, shoes, housewares, hardware,
electronics, home furnishings, small appliances, automotive accessories, horticulture and accessories, sporting goods, toys, pet food and pet accessories, cameras and supplies, health and beauty aids, pharmaceuticals, jewelry and optical and provide
photo processing services. In addition, our stores offer an assortment of grocery merchandise. The grocery assortment in our Supercenters consists of a full line of grocery items including meat, produce, deli, bakery, dairy, frozen foods and dry
grocery. Most of our Discount Stores carry a limited assortment of dry grocery merchandise while a number of our larger Discount Stores in some markets carry a broader assortment of grocery items, including perishable items. Neighborhood Markets are
generally organized into departments such as: dry grocery, meat, produce, deli, bakery, dairy, frozen foods,


pharmaceuticals, photo processing, health and beauty aids, household chemicals, paper goods, general merchandise and pet supplies.

Nationally advertised merchandise represents a significant portion of sales in the Wal-Mart Stores segment. We also market lines of merchandise under our
private-label store brands including “Sam’s Choice,” “Great Value,” “Everstart,” “Ol’ Roy,” “Puritan,” “Equate,” “No Boundaries,” “George,” “Athletic
Works,” “Durabrand,” “ILO,” “HomeTrends,” “Mainstays,” “Parent’s Choice,” “Ozark Trail,” “Relion” and “Kid Connection.” The Company also markets lines of
merchandise under licensed brands, some of which include “Faded Glory,” “General Electric,” “Disney,” “McDonald’s,” “Mary-Kate and Ashley,” “Metro 7” and “Starter.”

Sales in Discount Stores and Supercenters, which are subject to seasonal variance, by product category were as follows during the fiscal
year ended:

Operations.

Hours of operation for nearly all Supercenters and an increasing number
of Discount Stores and Neighborhood Markets are 24 hours each day. Hours of operation for the remaining Discount Stores and Neighborhood Markets vary by location, but are generally 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., seven days a week. The retail stores in our
Wal-Mart Stores segment generally maintain uniform prices, except where lower prices are necessary to meet local competition. Sales are primarily on a cash-and-carry basis with the objective of maximizing sales volume and inventory turnover while
minimizing expenses; however, we accept a variety of payment methods. In addition, our pharmacy departments accept payments for prescription drugs through our customers’ health benefit plans.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations.

The Wal-Mart Stores operating segment’s business is seasonal to a certain extent. Generally, its
highest volume of sales occurs in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday season, and the lowest volume occurs during our first fiscal quarter.

Competition.

Our Discount Stores compete with other discount, department, drug, variety and specialty stores and supermarkets, many of which are national chains. Our Supercenters compete with other
supercenter-type stores, discount stores, supermarkets, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, many of which are national or regional chains. We also compete with other retailers for new store sites.

Our ability to offer value and service to our customers largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We employ many programs
designed to meet the competitive pressures within our industry. These programs include the following:

•

Every day Low Prices (“EDLP”) – our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so that our customers trust that our prices will not change
erratically under frequent promotional activity;

•

Rollbacks – our commitment to pass continually internal and external cost savings on to the customer by lowering prices on selected goods;

•

Store Within a Store – a program to provide accountability to assistant managers and department managers as to merchandise planning and overall department performance; and

•

Store of the Community – a program to ensure that the merchandise assortment in a particular store fits the demographic needs of the local community in which that store is
located.


In addition to these programs, we believe our broad assortment of merchandise that provides one-stop shopping, our high
in-stock levels that provide confidence to our customers that we will have what they need, and our long operating hours that allow customers to shop at their convenience provide us with an additional competitive advantage.

Distribution.

During fiscal 2006, approximately 81% of the Wal-Mart Stores segment’s purchases of merchandise were shipped from 114
distribution centers. The balance of merchandise purchased was shipped directly to stores from suppliers. Wal-Mart owns and operates 39 general merchandise distribution centers, 35 grocery distribution centers, seven apparel and shoes distribution
centers, 12 specialty distribution centers, three import distribution centers and one distribution center that supports Walmart.com. Additionally, third-party operators are used in 18 distribution centers of which two are grocery distribution
centers, five are specialty distribution centers and two are import distribution centers and eight support Walmart.com. One of our three owned import facilities is operated by a third-party. The specialty distribution centers ship merchandise such
as jewelry, tires, optical, product returns, and pharmaceuticals. General merchandise is transported to stores primarily through our private truck fleet. However, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable and dry
grocery merchandise.

The 114 distribution centers are located throughout the continental United States. Fourteen distribution centers are
located in Texas; ten in Arkansas; nine in California; eight in Georgia; six in Indiana; five in Florida; four in each of New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania; three in each of Alabama, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Tennessee, Utah and
Virginia; two in each of Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Wisconsin; and one each in Colorado, Delaware, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Maryland, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon and
Washington.

In addition to servicing the Wal-Mart Stores segment, some of our Wal-Mart distribution centers also service our SAM’S
CLUB segment for perishable items, jewelry, tires and product returns.

SAM’S CLUB Operating Segment

The SAM’S CLUB segment had net sales of $39.8 billion, $37.1 billion and $34.5 billion for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single club location accounted for as much as 1% of total Company sales or net income.

General.

We operate SAM’S CLUBs in 48 states. Facility sizes for SAM’S CLUBs generally range between 70,000 and 190,000 square feet, with the average SAM’S CLUB facility being approximately 129,000 square feet.
SAM’S CLUB provides to its members a broad assortment of merchandise and services online at www.samsclub.com.

Merchandise.

SAM’S CLUB offers bulk displays of brand name merchandise, including hardgoods, some softgoods, institutional-size grocery items, and selected private-label items under the “MEMBER’S MARK,”
“BAKERS & CHEFS” and “SAM’S CLUB” brands. Generally, each SAM’S CLUB also carries software, electronics, jewelry, sporting goods, toys, tires, stationery and books. Most clubs have fresh departments, which
include bakery, meat, produce, floral and Sam’s Cafe. Additionally, a significant number of our clubs offer photo processing, pharmaceuticals, optical departments and gasoline stations.

Sales in the SAM’S CLUB segment, which are subject to seasonal variance, by product category were as follows during the fiscal year ended:

Certain fiscal 2005 amounts in the preceding table have been reclassed to conform to current
period presentation.

Operations.

Operating hours for SAM’S CLUBs are Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:30
p.m., Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Sunday from 11:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Additionally, all club locations offer a Gold Key


program that permits business members to shop before the regular operating hours Monday through Saturday, starting at 7:00 a.m.

SAM’S CLUBs are membership-only operations. A variety of payment methods are accepted at our clubs. Additionally, SAM’S CLUB issues Private
Label and Discover accounts that are without recourse to the Company. Members include both small business owners and individual consumers. Individuals who are not business owners can become “Advantage” members. The annual membership fee
for business members is $35 for the primary membership card with a spouse card available at no additional cost. In addition, business members can add up to eight business associates for $35 each. The annual membership fee for an individual
“Advantage” member is $40 for the primary membership card with a spouse card available at no additional cost. SAM’S CLUB PLUS is a premium membership program that offers additional benefits and services. The annual membership fee for
a PLUS member is $100.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations.

The SAM’S CLUB operating segment’s business is seasonal to
a certain extent. Generally, its highest volume of sales occurs in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday season, and the lowest volume occurs during our first fiscal quarter.

Competition.

SAM’S CLUBs compete with other warehouse clubs, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers and
general merchandise wholesalers and distributors. We compete with other retailers for desirable new club sites. Our ability to offer low prices and quality merchandise to meet the needs of small business members largely determines our competitive
position in the warehouse club industry.

Distribution.

During fiscal 2006, approximately 66% of the SAM’S CLUB non-fuel
purchases were shipped from the SAM’S CLUB segment’s dedicated distribution facilities and some of the Wal-Mart Stores segment’s grocery distribution centers for perishable items. Suppliers shipped the balance of the SAM’S CLUB
purchases directly to SAM’S CLUB locations. The principal focus of our SAM’S CLUB’s distribution operations is on crossdocking product, while stored inventory is minimized. Crossdocking is a distribution process under which shipments
are directly transferred from inbound to outbound trailers without extra storage. Shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a crossdock facility, sometimes less than an hour. A combination of seven Company-owned and operated distribution
facilities, thirteen third-party owned and operated facilities, and two third-party owned and operated import distribution centers constitute the overall distribution structure for the SAM’S CLUB segment. To support the samsclub.com business,
SAM’S CLUB uses one third-party owned and operated distribution center in Texas. Two of the Company-owned and operated facilities are located in Texas with single facilities located in Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana and Minnesota. Of the
third-party owned and operated facilities, two are in California and one is in each of Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington. The third-party operated import
facilities are located in California and South Carolina. SAM’S CLUB uses a combination of our private truck fleet as well as common carriers to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution centers to clubs. We contract with common
carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution centers to clubs.

International Operating Segment

Our International segment is comprised of our operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Puerto Rico, South
Korea, and the United Kingdom, our operations through majority-owned subsidiaries in Japan and Mexico and our operations through joint ventures in China. Wal-Mart’s portion of the results of our unconsolidated 33.3% minority interest in the
CARHCO were included in the Company’s Other segment at January 31, 2006. We acquired a controlling interest in CARHCO in February 2006, and after that date CARHCO will be consolidated into our International segment. CARHCO has retail
operations in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua.

The International segment’s net sales for the fiscal years
ended January 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, were $62.7 billion, $56.3 billion and $47.6 billion, respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single unit accounted for as much as 1% of total Company sales or net income.

Mercadorama (supermarkets), Nacional (supermarkets) and Maxxi Atacado (wholesale units) in Brazil;

•

•

ASDA stores (combination grocery and apparel stores), George stores (apparel stores) and ASDA Living stores (general merchandise stores) in the United Kingdom; and,

•

Amigo supermarkets in Puerto Rico.

Merchandise.

The merchandising strategy for the International operating segment is similar to that of our operations in the United States in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name
merchandise accounts for a majority of sales, several store brands not found in the United States have been developed to serve customers in the different markets in which the International segment operates. In addition, steps have been taken to
develop relationships with local suppliers in each country to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise.

Operations.

The hours of operation for operating units in the International segment vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. While sales are primarily on a
cash-and-carry basis, credit cards or other consumer finance programs exist in certain markets to facilitate the purchase of goods by the customer.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations.

The International operating segment’s business is seasonal to a certain extent. Generally, the highest volume of sales occurs in our fourth fiscal quarter. The seasonality of the business
varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different climatic conditions.

Competition.

The International operating segment competes with a variety of local, national and international chains in the supermarket, discount, department, drug, variety, specialty and wholesale sectors of the retail market
in each of the countries in which we operate and, in Mexico, with local, national and international restaurant chains. Our ability to offer our customers low prices on quality merchandise that offers exceptional value in the International operating
segment determines, to a large extent, our competitive position. In our international units, our ability to operate effectively the food departments has a major impact on the segment’s competitive position in the markets where we operate.

Distribution.

We utilize a total of 85 distribution facilities that are located in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China,
Germany, Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic product to the operating units of the International segment. During fiscal 2006, approximately 79% of the
International operating segment’s purchases flowed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the balance of the International operating segment’s purchases directly to our stores in the various countries in which we operate. A
combination of Company-owned and operated distribution facilities and third-party facilities makes up the overall distribution structure for the International operating segment. The International operating segment operates export consolidation
facilities in California, Florida, Pennsylvania and Texas in support of product flow to our Mexican, Canadian, Asian, and Latin American markets.

Employees

As of January 31, 2006, the Company employed approximately 1.8 million employees
(“associates”) worldwide, with approximately 1.3 million associates in the United States and approximately 500,000 associates in foreign countries. In the United States, the Company offers a broad range of company-paid benefits to our
associates, including a profit sharing and 401(k) plan, store discount cards, bonuses based on Company performance, discounted stock purchase program and life insurance. The Company also offers health care benefits to eligible full-time and
part-time associates. After the first year, the Company’s medical plan has no lifetime maximum for most expenses.

In our operations
outside the United States, the Company provides a variety of associate benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory requirements.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

The risks
described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not
presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations.

General economic factors, both domestically
and internationally, may adversely affect our financial performance.

General economic conditions, globally or in one or more of the
markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. In the United States, higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, inflation, higher levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, higher tax rates and other
changes in tax laws, and other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our Wal-Mart Stores segment and SAM’S CLUB segment, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower
average gross margin and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory. Higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, transportation costs, inflation, higher costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, foreign
exchange rates fluctuations, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors in the United States increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative
expenses, and otherwise adversely affect the operations and operating results of our Wal-Mart Stores segment and SAM’S CLUB segment. High levels of unemployment, inflation, changes in tax and other laws, currency devaluations and other adverse
developments in the economies of the other countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer demand for our merchandise in those countries, adversely affect our gross margins, cost of sales, inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise
adversely affect our operations and operating results in those countries.

We may face impediments to our expansion in the United
States, including conversions of Discount Stores into Supercenters, which could adversely affect our financial performance.

The
growth in the net sales and operating net income of our Wal-Mart Stores segment and our SAM’S CLUB segment depends to a substantial degree on our expansion programs. Our expansion strategy depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts
successfully in new markets within the United States and upon our ability to increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations. Our ability to open additional Supercenters, Discount Stores, Neighborhood Markets and
SAM’S CLUBs and to convert existing Discount Stores into Supercenters depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. Local land use and other
regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats, as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites, may affect our ability to open new stores and
clubs, to convert Discount Stores into Supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units. Increased real estate, construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our Discount Stores into
Supercenters. If we are unable to open new Supercenters, Discount Stores, Neighborhood Markets or SAM’S CLUBs or continue to convert Discount Stores into Supercenters, our financial performance could be adversely affected. In addition, if
consumers in the markets into which we expand are not receptive to our retail concepts, our financial performance could be adversely affected.

Impediments to the expansion of our International operations could adversely affect our financial performance.

Our
business strategy for our International segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to our existing International business, as well as opening new units in the countries in which we
have existing operations. In the countries in which we have existing operations, new units may be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats, such as Supercenters or SAM’S Clubs, not


previously operated in those markets. As in the United States, our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in a market served by
our International segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. Local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive pre-existing
buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units. In addition, access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing
units in certain markets. Moreover, cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets not being as receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate
those consumers will be. If we do not effectively execute our expansion plans for our International segment, our financial performance could be adversely affected.

We may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in consummating the acquisition of any such candidate identified. Although we believe we will be
ultimately able to integrate successfully any newly acquired operations into our existing operations, no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in
a reasonable time. Our failure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect the growth of our International segment
and our future financial performance.

Failure to attract and retain qualified associates and other labor issues could adversely
affect our financial performance.

Our ability to continue to expand our operations in the United States and abroad depends on our
ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates. Our ability to meet our labor needs generally, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs and
distribution centers, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are
located, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation. If we are unable to locate, to attract or to retain qualified personnel or if
our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly, our financial performance could be affected adversely.

We face strong
competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators, which could adversely affect our financial performance.

The retail
business is highly competitive. Each of our business segments competes for customers, employees, store sites, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional and national retailers, both in the
United States and in the foreign countries in which we have operations. Our Wal-Mart Stores segment competes with retailers operating discount, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores, hypermarts, as
well as internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. Our SAM’S CLUB segment competes with other wholesale club operators, as well as discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, as
well as internet-based retailers, wholesalers and catalog businesses. Internationally, we compete with retailers who operate department, drug, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores, hypermarts, wholesale clubs,
internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. Such retailers and wholesale club operators compete in a variety of ways, including merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities and
price. Our ability to offer value and service to our customers through various programs, including EDLP, Rollbacks, Store Within a Store and Store of the Community, have allowed us to compete successfully against our competitors in most instances.
Where necessary to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our EDLP philosophy, we will lower our prices on goods sold. Our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and
changes in the retail markets could adversely affect our financial performance. See “Item 1. Business.” above for additional discussion of our competitive situation in our various operating segments.

Although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented, certain segments of the retail industry are currently undergoing some consolidation, which
could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace. Such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration
than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies, which
could adversely affect our financial performance.


Risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our
financial performance.

The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global
sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. All of our suppliers must comply with applicable laws, including labor and environmental laws, and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier
standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the
United States. Political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers’ failure to meet our supplier standards, labor problems experienced by our suppliers,
the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise quality issues, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, inflation, and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our
control. In addition, the United States’ foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing
certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance.

Our International operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic
conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our financial performance.

We
currently conduct operations in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Costa Rico, El Salvador, Germany, Guatemala, Honduras, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico, South Korea and the United Kingdom, as well as through joint venture agreements in China. During
fiscal 2006, our International operations generated 20.1% of our net sales. As a result of recent acquisitions of operations in foreign countries, we expect that our International operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in
future years. Our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political
conditions, economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, currency regulations, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations
may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our International operations, and could adversely affect our financial performance. Moreover, the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past
suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our International operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal
policies both of the United States and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have
historically been less stable than the United States. Additional risks inherent in our International operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater
difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the United States. The various risks inherent in doing business in the United States generally also exist when doing business outside of the United States, and may be
exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations.

Natural disasters and geo-political events costs could adversely affect our financial performance.

The occurrence of
one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes and earthquakes, and geo-political events, such as civil unrest in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located and attacks disrupting transportation systems, could adversely
affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties, the temporary closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution centers, the temporary lack of an adequate work force
in a market, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply or products from some local and overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or
stores within a country in which we are operating and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our stores. These factors could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and financial performance.

We expect that the significant property damage experienced by the Company and others during last year’s hurricanes will result in substantial
increases in property insurance premiums and limitations in coverage offered by the property insurance markets to us and others. As a result the Company will likely face higher property insurance premiums, an increase in retained risk, or a
combination of the two, which could adversely affect our financial performance.


We are subject to certain legal proceedings that may adversely affect our financial condition and
results of operation.

We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other
litigation. Certain of these lawsuits, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in liability material to our financial condition and results of operations. We are currently a defendant in numerous cases containing class-action
allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws. In addition, we are a defendant in

Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

, a class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of all past and present female
employees in all of our retail stores and wholesale clubs in the United States. The class as certified in

Dukes

currently includes approximately 1.6 million present and former female associates. The plaintiffs in this case allege that we
have engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminating against women in promotions, pay, training and job assignments and seek, among other things, injunctive relief, front pay, back pay, punitive damages and attorneys’ fees. The U.S.
District Court hearing this case has issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. We discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail below under the
caption “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” and in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements, which are part of our Annual Report to Shareholders which is incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K and is included as an exhibit to this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

the caption “Distribution” provided for each of our segments under Item 1. Business.

We own the office facilities in
Bentonville, Arkansas that serve as our home office. We lease an office facility in Brisbane, California that serves as the home office for Walmart.com

International.

We operate our International segment stores and restaurants in a combination of owned and leased properties in each country in which our International segment operates. As of
January 31, 2006, we owned nine properties in Argentina, 107 properties in Brazil, 96 properties in Canada, no properties in China, 19 properties in Germany, 86 properties in Japan, 16 properties in South Korea, 395 properties in Mexico, 10
properties in Puerto Rico and 202 properties in the United Kingdom in which operating units are located, with the remaining units in each country being leased on terms that vary from property to property. We utilize both owned and leased properties

II. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters. The following matters are
disclosed in accordance with that requirement:

The District Attorney for Solano County, California, has alleged that the Company’s
store in Vacaville, California, failed to comply with certain California statutes regulating hazardous waste and hazardous materials handling practices. Specifically, the County is alleging that the Company improperly disposed of a limited amount of
damaged or returned product containing dry granular fertilizer and pesticides on or about April 3, 2002. The parties are currently negotiating toward a resolution of this matter.

The District Attorney for Orange County, California, has alleged that the Company’s store in Foothill Ranch, California, failed to comply with
certain California statutes regulating hazardous waste and hazardous materials handling


practices. Specifically, the County is alleging that the Company improperly disposed of a limited amount of damaged product containing dry granular pesticide
on or about January 24, 2005. The parties are currently negotiating toward a resolution of this matter.

The EPA has alleged that the
Company and one of its construction contractors have violated the EPA’s stormwater regulations at a site in Caguas, Puerto Rico. The Administrative Complaint filed by the agency proposes an administrative penalty in the amount of $157,500. The
parties are currently negotiating toward a resolution of this matter.

On November 8, 2005, the Company received a grand jury subpoena
from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California, seeking documents and information relating to the Company’s receipt, transportation, handling, identification, recycling, treatment, storage and disposal of
certain merchandise that constitutes hazardous materials or hazardous waste. The Company has been informed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California that it is a target of a criminal investigation into potential
violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), the Clean Water Act, and the Hazardous Materials Transportation Statute. This U.S. Attorney’s Office contends, among other things, that the use of Company trucks to
transport certain returned merchandise from the Company’s stores to its return centers is prohibited by RCRA because those materials may be considered hazardous waste. The government alleges that, to comply with RCRA, the Company must ship from
the store certain materials as “hazardous waste” directly to a certified disposal facility using a certified hazardous waste carrier. The Company contends that the practice of transporting returned merchandise to its return centers for
subsequent disposition, including disposal by certified facilities, is compliant with applicable laws and regulations.

Additionally, the
U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Northern District of California has initiated its own investigation regarding the Company’s handling of hazardous materials and hazardous waste and the Company has received administrative document requests
from the California Department of Toxic Substances Control requesting documents and information with respect to two of the Company’s distribution facilities. Further, the Company also received a subpoena from the Los Angeles County District
Attorney’s Office for documents and administrative interrogatories requesting information, among other things, regarding the Company’s handling of materials and hazardous waste. California state and local government authorities and the
State of Nevada have also initiated investigations into these matters. The Company is cooperating fully with the respective authorities.

The Company cannot estimate the possible loss or range of loss which may arise from this matter.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A
VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted to a vote of the Company’s security holders during the last quarter of the
fiscal year ended January 31, 2006.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are
designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any
controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also,
we have investments in certain unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our
consolidated subsidiaries.

In the ordinary course of business, we review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make
changes to our systems and processes to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems and
automating manual processes.

An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures was
performed as of the end of the period covered by this report. This evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and
are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules and forms.
