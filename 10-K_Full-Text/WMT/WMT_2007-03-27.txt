CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND INFORMATION

This Annual Report on Form 10-K, the other reports, statements, and information that Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries hereinafter
referred to as “we,” “Wal-Mart” or the “Company”) have previously filed or that we may subsequently file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and public announcements that we have previously
made or may subsequently make include, may include, incorporate by reference or may incorporate by reference certain statements that may be deemed to be “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995 and are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by that Act. The forward-looking statements included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K and that are or may be
included or incorporated by reference in those reports, statements, information and announcements address activities, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future, including or relating, but not limited to, the
amount and nature of future capital expenditures, opening of additional stores and clubs in the United States, opening of additional units in the other countries in which we operate, conversion of discount stores into supercenters, remodeling of or
special projects at existing units, anticipated levels of change in comparable store sales from one period to another period, expansion and other development trends of the retail industry, our ability to integrate newly acquired operations into our
existing operations, our business strategy, our financing strategy, expansion and growth of our business, our capital expenditures, changes in our operations, including the mix of products sold, our liquidity and ability to access the capital
markets, our anticipated earnings per share for certain periods, our expected comparable store sales for certain periods and other similar matters. Forward-looking statements are often identified by the use of words or phrases such as
“anticipate,” “believe,” “could occur,” “could result,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “plan,” “will be,” and “will continue.” Although we believe
the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-K and those reports, statements, information and announcements are based or will be based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our
business, a number of factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements, whether oral or written, made by us or on our behalf. Many of these factors have previously been
identified in filings or statements made by us or on our behalf.

Our business operations are subject to factors outside our control. Any
one, or a combination, of these factors could materially affect our financial performance, business operations, business strategy, plans, goals and objectives. These factors include, but are not limited to: the cost of goods, information security
costs, labor costs, the cost of fuel and electricity, the cost of healthcare benefits, insurance costs, the cost of construction materials, competitive pressures, inflation, accident-related costs, consumer buying patterns and debt levels, weather
patterns, catastrophic events, transport of goods from foreign suppliers, currency exchange fluctuations, trade restrictions, changes in tariff and freight rates, adoption of or changes in tax and other laws and regulations that affect our business,
the outcome of legal proceedings to which we are a party, unemployment levels, interest rate fluctuations, changes in employment legislation and other capital market, economic and geo-political conditions and events. Moreover, we typically earn a
disproportionate part of annual operating income in the fourth quarter as a result of the seasonal buying patterns. Those buying patterns are difficult to forecast with certainty. The foregoing list of factors that may affect our performance is not
exclusive. Other factors and unanticipated events could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. Readers are urged to consider all of these risks, uncertainties and other factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking
statements. Forward-looking statements that we make or that are made by others on our behalf are based on a knowledge of our business and the environment in which we operate, but because of the factors described and listed above, as well as other
factors, or as a result of changes in facts, assumptions not being realized or other circumstances, actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements. Consequently, this cautionary statement qualifies all
of the forward-looking statements we make herein and that are incorporated by reference herein. We cannot assure the reader that the results or developments expected or anticipated by us will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that
those results or developments will result in the expected consequences for us or affect us, our business or our operations in the way we expect. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as
of their dates. We undertake no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances except to the extent required by applicable law.

ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2007

PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

General

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (“Wal-Mart,” the “Company” or “we”) operates retail stores in various formats around the world and is
committed to saving people money so they can live better. We earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at every day low prices (“EDLP”) while fostering a culture that
rewards and embraces mutual respect, integrity and diversity. EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so that our customers trust that our prices will not change erratically under frequent promotional
activity. Our fiscal year ends on January 31. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2007, we had net sales of $345.0 billion.

Our Wal-Mart Stores segment is the largest segment of our business, accounting for 65.6% of our fiscal 2007 net sales. This segment consists of three different traditional retail formats, all of which operate in the United States, and
Wal-Mart’s online retail format, walmart.com. Our traditional Wal-Mart Stores retail formats include:

•

Supercenters, which average approximately 187,000 square feet in size and offer a wide assortment of general merchandise and a full-line supermarket;

•

Discount stores, which average approximately 107,000 square feet in size and offer a wide assortment of general merchandise and a limited variety of food products;
and

•

Neighborhood Markets, which average approximately 42,000 square feet in size and offer a full-line supermarket and a limited assortment of general merchandise.

Our Sam’s Club segment consists of membership warehouse clubs, which operate in the United States, and the
segment’s online retail format, samsclub.com. Sam’s Club accounted for 12.1% of our fiscal 2007 net sales. Our focus for Sam’s Club is to provide exceptional value on brand-name merchandise at “members only” prices for both
business and personal use. Our Sam’s Clubs average approximately 132,000 square feet in size.

At January 31, 2007, our
International segment consisted of retail operations in 12 countries and Puerto Rico. This segment generated 22.3% of our fiscal 2007 net sales. The International segment includes several different formats of retail stores and restaurants, including
discount stores, supercenters and Sam’s Clubs that operate outside the United States.

We maintain our principal offices at 702 S.W.
8th Street, Bentonville, Arkansas 72716, USA.


The Development of Our Company

Although Wal-Mart was incorporated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946,
his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders’ business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount
store, opened. In fiscal 1984, we opened our first three Sam’s Clubs, and in fiscal 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In fiscal 1999, we opened our first Neighborhood Market.

In fiscal 1992, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico, in which we owned a 50% interest along with
Cifra S.A. de C.V. (“Cifra”). In fiscal 1998, we acquired the controlling interest in Cifra, and in February 2000, Cifra officially changed its name to Wal-Mart de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. Since fiscal 1992, our international presence has
continued to expand, and at January 31, 2007, we had international operations in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico, and the United Kingdom. We also operate through
joint ventures in China.

At January 31, 2007, we operated 1,075 discount stores, 2,256 supercenters, 579 Sam’s Clubs and 112
Neighborhood Markets in the United States. Internationally, at the end of fiscal year 2007, the Company operated units in Argentina (13), Brazil (299), Canada (289), Costa Rica (137), El Salvador (63), Guatemala (132), Honduras (41), Japan (392),
Mexico (889), Nicaragua (40), Puerto Rico (54), and the United Kingdom (335). We also operated 73 stores through joint ventures in China at January 31, 2007. In October 2006, we disposed of our South Korean and German operations.

The following tables provide summary information regarding the numbers, additions and square footage of our discount stores, supercenters, Neighborhood
Markets and Sam’s Clubs in the United States, and the numbers and square footage of our units in our international markets for each of our fiscal years from fiscal 2003 through fiscal 2007.

had net sales of $226.3 billion, $209.9 billion and $191.8 billion for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single supercenter, discount store or Neighborhood Market
location accounted for as much as 1% of total Company net sales or net income.

General.

The Wal-Mart Stores segment operates
retail stores in all 50 states, with discount stores in 47 states, supercenters in 47 states and Neighborhood Markets in 15 states. Our discount stores range in size from 30,000 square feet to 224,000 square feet, with an average size of

feet, with an average size of approximately 42,000 square feet. Customers also can access a broad assortment of merchandise and services online at

.

Merchandise.

Wal-Mart discount stores and the general merchandise area of supercenters carry apparel for women, girls, men, boys and infants, domestics, fabrics and notions, stationery and books, shoes,
housewares, hardware, electronics, home furnishings, small appliances, automotive accessories, horticulture and accessories, sporting goods, toys, pet food and pet accessories, cellular phones and cellular service plan contracts, cameras and
supplies, health and beauty aids, pharmaceuticals, jewelry and optical and provide photo processing services. In addition, our stores offer an assortment of grocery merchandise. The Wal-Mart Stores segment also offers financial services and
products, including money order sales, wire transfers, check cashing and bill payment. The grocery assortment in our supercenters consists of a full line of grocery items including meat, produce, deli, bakery, dairy, frozen foods, floral and dry
grocery. Most of our discount stores carry a limited assortment of dry grocery merchandise, while a number of our larger discount stores in some markets carry a broader assortment of grocery items, including perishable items. Neighborhood Markets
are generally organized into departments such as: dry grocery, meat, produce, deli, bakery, dairy, frozen foods, floral, pharmaceuticals, photo processing, health and beauty aids, household chemicals, paper goods, general merchandise and pet
supplies.

Nationally advertised merchandise represents a significant portion of sales in the Wal-Mart Stores segment. We also market lines
of merchandise under our private-label store brands including “Sam’s Choice,” “Great Value,” “Everstart,” “Ol’ Roy,” “Puritan,” “Equate,” “No Boundaries,”
“George,” “Athletic Works,” “Durabrand,” “ILO,” “HomeTrends,” “Mainstays,” “Metro 7,” “Parent’s Choice,” “Ozark Trail,” “Relion,” “White
Stag” and “Kid Connection.” The Company also markets lines of merchandise under licensed brands, some of which include “General Electric,” “Disney,” “McDonald’s,” “Mary-Kate and Ashley,”
and “Starter.”


Sales in discount stores and supercenters, by product category were as follows during the fiscal year
ended:

Operations.

Hours of operation for nearly all supercenters and an increasing number
of discount stores and Neighborhood Markets are 24 hours each day. Hours of operation for the remaining supercenters, discount stores and Neighborhood Markets vary by location, but are generally 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 or 11:00 p.m., seven days a week.
The retail stores in our Wal-Mart Stores segment generally maintain uniform prices, except where lower prices are necessary to meet local competition. We accept a variety of payment methods including credit cards and a private-label store credit
card through a third-party provider. In addition, our pharmacy departments accept payments for prescription drugs through our customers’ health benefit plans.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations.

The Wal-Mart Stores segment’s business is seasonal to a certain extent. Generally, its highest volume of sales occurs in the fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the
holiday season, and the lowest volume occurs during the first fiscal quarter.

Competition.

Our discount stores compete with
other discount, department, drug, variety and specialty stores and supermarkets, many of which are national or regional chains. Our supercenters compete with other supercenter-type stores, hypermarts, discount stores, supermarkets, department, drug,
variety and specialty stores, many of which are national or regional chains. We also compete with internet-based retailers and catalog business and with other retailers for new store sites.

Our ability to develop the right locations and offer value and service to our customers largely determines our competitive position within the retail
industry. We employ many programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry. These programs include the following:

•

Every day Low Prices (“EDLP”) – our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so that our customers trust that our
prices will not change erratically under frequent promotional activity;

•

Rollbacks – our commitment to pass continually internal and external cost savings on to the customer by lowering prices on selected goods;

•

Store Within a Store – a program to provide accountability to assistant managers and department managers as to merchandise planning and overall department
performance; and

•

Store of the Community – a program to ensure that the merchandise assortment in a particular store fits the demographic needs of the local community in which
that store is located.

In addition to these programs, we believe our broad assortment of merchandise that provides
one-stop shopping, our in-stock levels that provide confidence to our customers that we will have what they need, and our long operating hours that allow customers to shop at their convenience provide us with additional competitive advantages.

Distribution.

During fiscal 2007, approximately 80% of the Wal-Mart Stores segment’s purchases of merchandise were
shipped from 121 distribution centers. The balance of merchandise purchased was shipped directly to stores from suppliers. Wal-Mart owns and operates 40 general merchandise distribution centers, 38 grocery distribution centers, seven apparel and


shoes distribution centers, 12 professional services and specialty distribution centers, two import distribution centers and three distribution centers that
support walmart.com. Additionally, third-party operators are used in 19 distribution centers of which two are grocery distribution centers, five are specialty distribution centers, four are import distribution centers and eight support walmart.com.
The professional services distribution centers ship merchandise such as jewelry, tires, optical, product returns, and pharmaceuticals. General merchandise is transported to stores primarily through our private truck fleet. However, we contract with
common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable and dry grocery merchandise.

The 121 distribution centers are located
throughout the continental United States. Fourteen distribution centers are located in Texas; eleven in Arkansas; nine in California; eight in Georgia; six in Indiana; five in each of Florida, Illinois, New York, and Pennsylvania; four in each of
Ohio and Virginia; three in each of Alabama, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Utah; two in each of Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Wisconsin; and one each in Colorado, Delaware, Iowa, Kansas,
Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington.

In addition to servicing the Wal-Mart
Stores segment, some of our Wal-Mart distribution centers also service our Sam’s Club segment for perishable items, jewelry, tires and product returns.

Sam’s Club Segment

The Sam’s Club segment had net sales of $41.6 billion, $39.8 billion and $37.1 billion for the
fiscal years ended January 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single club location accounted for as much as 1% of total Company net sales or net income.

General.

We operate Sam’s Clubs in 48 states. Facility sizes for Sam’s Clubs generally range between 72,000 and 190,000 square
feet, with the average Sam’s Club facility being approximately 132,000 square feet. Sam’s Club also provides its members with a broad assortment of merchandise and services online at

www.samsclub.com

.

Merchandise.

Sam’s Club offers bulk displays of brand name merchandise, including hardgoods, some softgoods, institutional-size
grocery items, and selected private-label items under the “MEMBER’S MARK,” “BAKERS & CHEFS” and “SAM’S CLUB” brands. Generally, each Sam’s Club also carries software, electronics, jewelry,
exercise equipment, outdoor goods, tires, office supplies and books. Most clubs have fresh departments, which include bakery, meat, produce, floral and Sam’s Cafe. Additionally, a significant number of our clubs offer photo processing,
pharmaceuticals, optical departments and gasoline stations.

Sales in the Sam’s Club segment, which are subject to seasonal variance,
by product category were as follows during the fiscal year ended:

Operations.

Operating hours for Sam’s Clubs are Monday through Friday from
10:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Sunday from 11:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Additionally, all club locations offer a Gold Key program that permits business members to shop before the regular operating hours Monday through
Saturday, starting at 7:00 a.m.

Sam’s Clubs are membership-only operations. A variety of payment methods are accepted at our clubs,
including MasterCard beginning in fiscal 2007. Additionally, Sam’s Club markets private label and Discover accounts that are without recourse to the Company. Members include both small business owners and individual consumers. Individuals who
are not business owners can become Advantage members. The annual membership fee for an individual Advantage member is $40 for the primary membership card, with a spouse card available at no additional cost. The annual membership fee for business
members is $35 for the primary membership card, with a spouse/household card available at no additional cost. In addition, business members can add up to eight business associates (add-ons) to their business account for $35 each. Businesses can also
purchase Advantage memberships for their employees under a Group Membership Program. Group rates are $30 per group Advantage membership when purchasing 50 - 999 memberships and $25 per group Advantage membership when purchasing 1,000 or more
memberships. Sam's Club PLUS is a premium membership program that offers additional benefits


and services. The annual fee for a Primary PLUS member (Business or Advantage) is $100. In addition, Business Plus primary members can add up to 16 business
associates (add-ons) to their business membership for $35 each.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations.

The Sam’s Club
segment’s business is seasonal to a certain extent. Generally, its highest volume of sales occurs in the fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday season, and the lowest volume occurs during the first fiscal quarter.

Competition.

Sam’s Club competes with other warehouse clubs, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general
merchandise wholesalers and distributors, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. We compete with other retailers for desirable new club sites. Our ability to offer low prices and quality merchandise to meet the needs of small business
members largely determines our competitive position in the warehouse club industry.

Distribution.

During fiscal 2007,
approximately 65% of the Sam’s Club non-fuel purchases were shipped from the Sam’s Club segment’s dedicated distribution facilities and some of the Wal-Mart Stores segment’s distribution centers for perishable items, jewelry,
tires and product returns. Suppliers shipped the balance of the Sam’s Club purchases directly to Sam’s Club locations. The principal focus of our Sam’s Club’s distribution operations is on crossdocking product, while stored
inventory is minimized. Crossdocking is a distribution process under which shipments are directly transferred from inbound to outbound trailers without extra storage. Shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a crossdock facility, sometimes
less than an hour. A combination of seven Company-owned and operated distribution facilities, 13 third-party owned and operated facilities, and two third-party owned and operated import distribution centers constitute the overall distribution
structure for the Sam’s Club segment. To support the samsclub.com business, Sam’s Club uses one third-party owned and operated distribution center in Texas. Two of the Company-owned and operated facilities are located in Texas with single
facilities located in Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana and Minnesota. Of the third-party owned and operated facilities, two are in California and one is in each of Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, North
Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington. The third-party operated import facilities are located in California and South Carolina. Sam’s Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet as well as common carriers to transport
non-perishable merchandise from distribution centers to clubs. We contract with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution centers to clubs.

subsidiaries in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Puerto Rico, and the United Kingdom, our operations through majority-owned subsidiaries in Central America, Japan and Mexico and our operations through joint ventures in China.

Merchandise.

The merchandising strategy for the International segment is similar to that
of our operations in the United States in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of sales, several store brands not found in the United States have been developed to serve
customers in the different markets in which the International segment operates. In addition, steps have been taken to develop relationships with local suppliers in each country to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise.

Operations.

The hours of operation for operating units in the International segment vary by country and by individual markets within
countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. While sales are primarily on a cash-and-carry basis, credit cards or other consumer finance programs exist in certain markets to facilitate the purchase of goods
by the customer.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations.

The International segment’s business is seasonal to a certain extent.
Generally, the highest volume of sales occurs in the fourth fiscal quarter. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different climatic conditions.

Competition.

The International segment competes with a variety of local, national and international chains in the
supermarket, discount, department, drug, variety, specialty stores, supercenter-type stores, hypermarts, wholesale clubs, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses in each of the countries in which we operate and, in Mexico, with local,
national and international restaurant chains. Our ability to offer our customers low prices on quality merchandise that offers exceptional value in the International segment determines, to a large extent, our competitive position. In our
international units, our ability to effectively operate the food departments has a major impact on the segment’s competitive position in the markets where we operate.

Distribution.

We utilize a total of 126 distribution facilities located in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Costa Rica, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic product to the operating units of the International segment. During fiscal 2007,
approximately 78% of the International segment’s purchases flowed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the balance of the International segment’s purchases directly to our stores in the various countries in which we
operate. A combination of Company-owned and operated distribution facilities and third-party facilities makes up the overall distribution structure for the International segment. The International segment operates export consolidation facilities in
California, Florida and Texas in support of product flow to our Mexican, Asian, and Central and South American markets. Additionally, a Wal-Mart Stores segment distribution center in Pennsylvania exports products to our operations in Canada.

Employees

As of January 31,
2007, the Company employed approximately 1.9 million employees (“associates”) worldwide, with approximately 1.36 million associates in the United States and approximately 550,000 associates in foreign countries. Like almost all
retailers, the Company has a large number of part-time, hourly employees and experiences significant turnover in employees each year. In the United States, the Company offers a broad range of company-paid benefits to our associates, including a
profit sharing and 401(k) plan, store discount cards, bonuses based on Company performance, discounted stock purchase program and life insurance. The Company also offers health care benefits to eligible full-time and part-time associates. After the
first year, the Company’s medical plan has no lifetime maximum for most expenses.

In our operations outside the United States, the
Company provides a variety of associate benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory requirements.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

The risks described below
could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not
presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations.

General economic factors, both domestically and
internationally, may adversely affect our financial performance.

General economic conditions, globally or in one or more of the
markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. In the United States, higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, inflation, higher levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, higher tax rates and other
changes in tax laws, and other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our Wal-Mart Stores segment and Sam’s Club segment, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower
average gross margin and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory. Higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, transportation costs, inflation, higher costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, foreign
exchange rates fluctuations, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors in the United States increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative
expenses, and otherwise adversely affect the operations and operating results of our Wal-Mart Stores segment and Sam’s Club segment. High levels of unemployment, inflation, changes in tax and other laws, currency devaluations and other adverse
developments in the economies of the other countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer demand for our merchandise in those countries, adversely affect our gross margins, cost of sales, inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise
adversely affect our operations and operating results in our International segment.

We may face impediments to our expansion in the
United States, including conversions of discount stores into supercenters, which may adversely affect our financial performance.

Our
expansion strategy depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the United States and upon our ability to increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations. Our ability to
open additional supercenters, discount stores, Neighborhood Markets and Sam’s Clubs and to convert existing discount stores into supercenters depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and to
acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats, as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific
stores at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our operations, may affect our ability to open new stores and clubs, to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units in certain cities
and states. Increased real estate, construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters. If we are unable to open new supercenters, discount stores, Neighborhood
Markets or Sam’s Clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters, our financial performance, such as net sales and operating income growth, could be adversely affected. In addition, if consumers in the markets into which we
expand are not receptive to our retail concepts, our financial performance could be adversely affected.


Impediments to the expansion of our International operations could adversely affect our financial
performance.

Our business strategy for our International segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances
that add new stores and markets to our existing International business, as well as opening new units in the countries in which we have existing operations. In the countries in which we have existing operations, new units may be opened in the formats
already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats, such as supercenters or Sam’s Clubs, not previously operated in those markets. As in the United States, our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate
existing stores in a market served by our International segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. Local laws can affect our
ability to acquire attractive pre-existing buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units. In addition, access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units
or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets. Moreover, cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets not being as
receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate those consumers will be. If we do not effectively execute our expansion plans for our International segment, our financial performance could be adversely affected.

We may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the acquisition of
any such candidate identified. Although we ultimately believe we will be able to successfully integrate any newly acquired operations into our existing operations, no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully
integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time. Our failure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing
operations could adversely affect the growth of our International segment and our future financial performance.

Failure to attract and
retain qualified associates and other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance.

Our ability to continue to expand
our operations in the United States and abroad depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions
that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs and distribution centers, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of
qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation. If we are
unable to locate, to attract or to retain qualified personnel or if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly, our financial performance could be affected adversely.

We face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators, which could adversely affect our financial performance.

The retail business is highly competitive. Each of our business segments competes for customers, employees, store sites, products and services and in
other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional and national retailers, both in the United States and in the foreign countries in which we have operations. Our Wal-Mart Stores segment competes with retailers operating
discount, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores and hypermarts, as well as internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. Our Sam’s Club segment competes with other wholesale club operators, as
well as discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, as well as internet-based retailers, wholesalers and catalog businesses. Internationally, we compete with retailers who operate
department, drug, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores, hypermarts, wholesale clubs, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. Such retailers and wholesale club operators compete in a variety of ways, including
merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities and price. Our ability to offer value and service to our customers through various programs, including EDLP, Rollbacks, Store Within a
Store and Store of the Community, have allowed us to compete successfully against our competitors in most instances. Where necessary to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our EDLP
philosophy, we will lower our prices on goods for sale. Our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could adversely affect our financial performance. See “Item 1. Business.” above for
additional discussion of our competitive situation in our various operating segments.

Although the retail industry as a whole is highly
fragmented, certain segments of the retail industry are currently undergoing some consolidation, which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace. Such consolidation may result in competitors
with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to


merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such business combinations could
result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance.

Risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our financial performance.

The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an
important factor in our financial performance. All of our suppliers must comply with applicable laws, including labor and environmental laws, and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find
qualified suppliers who meet our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the United States. Political and economic
instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers’ failure to meet our supplier standards, labor problems experienced by our suppliers, the availability of raw materials to
suppliers, merchandise quality issues, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, inflation, and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control. In addition, the United
States’ foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other
countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance.

Our International operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic conditions
specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our financial performance.

We currently conduct
operations in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom, as well as through joint venture agreements in China. During fiscal 2007, our International
operations generated 22.3% of our net sales. As a result of recent acquisitions of operations in foreign countries, we expect that our International operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years despite the recent
dispositions of our operations in Germany and South Korea. Our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our
control. These factors include political conditions, economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, currency regulations, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. In addition, foreign
currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our International operations, and could adversely affect our financial performance. Moreover, the economies of some of the countries in
which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our International operations
include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies both of the United States and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having major
facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the United States. Additional risks inherent in our International operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international
operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the United States. The various risks inherent in doing business in the United States generally also exist when doing
business outside of the United States, and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations.

Natural disasters and geo-political events costs could adversely affect our financial performance.

The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes and earthquakes, and geo-political events, such as civil unrest in a country in which
we operate or in which our suppliers are located or terrorist attacks disrupting transportation and utility systems, both internationally and domestically, could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in
physical damage to one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution centers, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and
overseas suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores within a country in which we are operating and the reduction in the availability of products in our
stores. These factors could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and financial performance.


The significant property damage experienced by the Company and others resulting from the hurricanes in
fiscal year 2006 resulted in substantial increases in property insurance premiums and limitations in coverage offered by the property insurance markets to us and others. The insurance coverage offered to the Company for named windstorms, such as
hurricanes and tropical storms, was substantially more limited and carried higher premiums. As a result the Company has chosen to be primarily self-insured for losses that may result from named windstorms.

Named windstorm activity was minimal in fiscal 2007, and the Company did not incur any significant losses this past hurricane season.

We are subject to certain legal proceedings that may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. Certain of these lawsuits, if decided
adversely to us or settled by us, may result in liability material to our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We are currently a defendant in numerous cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have
brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws. In addition, we are a defendant in

Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

, a class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of all past and present female employees in all of our retail stores and
wholesale clubs in the United States. The class as certified in

Dukes

currently includes approximately 1.6 million present and former female associates. The plaintiffs in this case allege that we have engaged in a pattern and practice of
discriminating against women in promotions, pay, training and job assignments and seek, among other things, injunctive relief, front pay, back pay, punitive damages and attorneys’ fees. The U.S. district court hearing this case has issued an
order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, which we have appealed. Recently, a divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the district
court’s ruling, and we are now asking that the ruling be reconsidered by a larger panel of that Court of Appeals. We discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail below under the caption “Item 3. Legal
Proceedings” and in Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which are part of our Annual Report to Shareholders which is incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is included as an exhibit to this Annual Report
on Form 10-K.

If we do not maintain the security of customer-related information, we could damage our reputation with customers, incur
substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation.

As do most retailers, we receive certain personal information about our
customers. In addition, our online operations at www.walmart.com and www.samsclub.com depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. A compromise of our
security systems that results in customer personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our customers and others, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and
liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a
disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations.

II. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS:

Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain
environmental matters. The following matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement:

The District Attorney for Solano County, California, has
alleged that the Company’s store in Vacaville, California, failed to comply with certain California statutes regulating hazardous waste and hazardous materials handling practices. Specifically, the County is alleging that the Company improperly
disposed of a limited amount of damaged or returned product containing dry granular fertilizer and pesticides on or about April 3, 2002. The parties are currently negotiating toward a resolution of this matter.

The District Attorney for Orange County, California, has alleged that the Company’s store in Foothill Ranch, California, failed to comply with certain California
statutes regulating hazardous waste and hazardous materials handling practices. Specifically, the County is alleging that the Company improperly disposed of a limited amount of damaged product containing dry granular pesticide on or about
January 24, 2005. The parties are currently negotiating toward a resolution of this matter.

The Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has
alleged that the Company and one of its construction contractors have violated the EPA’s stormwater regulations at a site in Caguas, Puerto Rico. The Administrative Complaint filed by the agency proposes an administrative penalty in the amount
of $157,500. The parties are currently negotiating toward a resolution of this matter.

The Company is involved in discussions with the California Air
Resources Board (“CARB”) to resolve a Notice of Violation issued by CARB alleging that the Company sold portable fuel containers and spouts in California which were not compliant with California’s Portable Fuel Containers and Spouts
regulations. CARB alleges that in June 2006, the Company offered for sale various non-compliant 5-gallon portable fuel containers. The Company conducted its own research and discovered possible sales of additional items between 2002 and 2006 which
may not have been compliant with the regulations. The Company voluntarily reported this additional information to CARB. The parties are currently negotiating toward a resolution of this matter.

The EPA recently approached a grocery industry group to resolve issues relating to refrigerant-handling practices and to reduce the use of ozone-depleting refrigerants
in refrigeration equipment. The Company then approached the EPA independently to address these issues, and proposed a plan for removing ozone-depleting refrigerants from certain types of refrigeration equipment. The parties are currently negotiating
toward a resolution of this matter.


On February 1, 2007, the Company received from the EPA a request pursuant to Section 114(a) of the Federal
Clean Air Act seeking detailed information regarding all non-essential products containing ozone-depleting substances including products such as Loony String which Wal-Mart may have sold or distributed since January 1, 2002. On March 8,
2007, the EPA issued a revised request for information in which it limited its request to string products including Loony String, Silly String and Fiesta String, and covering the period from 2004 to the present. Wal-Mart is in the process of
gathering the information requested.

In January 2007, Wal-Mart Puerto Rico, Inc. became aware that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“USACE”)
was concerned about alleged violations of a permit issued by that agency in 2003, for the fill of 0.23 acres of a creek and its contiguous wetlands during the construction of the Wal-Mart Store in Caguas, Puerto Rico. On January 19, 2007,
Wal-Mart Puerto Rico responded to these issues in writing. On January 25, 2007, the USACE issued a formal Notice of Non-Compliance to Wal-Mart Puerto Rico regarding this matter. Wal-Mart Puerto Rico filed a formal response and is currently
implementing mitigation measures and working with the USACE to resolve the matter.

On November 8, 2005, the Company received a grand jury subpoena
from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California, seeking documents and information relating to the Company’s receipt, transportation, handling, identification, recycling, treatment, storage and disposal of
certain merchandise that constitutes hazardous materials or hazardous waste. The Company has been informed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California that it is a target of a criminal investigation into potential
violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), the Clean Water Act, and the Hazardous Materials Transportation Statute. This U.S. Attorney’s Office contends, among other things, that the use of Company trucks to
transport certain returned merchandise from the Company’s stores to its return centers is prohibited by RCRA because those materials may be considered hazardous waste. The government alleges that, to comply with RCRA, the Company must ship from
the store certain materials as “hazardous waste” directly to a certified disposal facility using a certified hazardous waste carrier. The Company contends that the practice of transporting returned merchandise to its return centers for
subsequent disposition, including disposal by certified facilities, is compliant with applicable laws and regulations. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss which may arise from this matter.

Additionally, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Northern District of California has initiated its own investigation regarding the Company’s handling of
hazardous materials and hazardous waste and the Company has received administrative document requests from the California Department of Toxic Substances Control requesting documents and information with respect to two of the Company’s
distribution facilities. Further, the Company also received a subpoena from the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office for documents and administrative interrogatories requesting information, among other things, regarding the
Company’s handling of materials and hazardous waste. California state and local government authorities and the State of Nevada have also initiated investigations into these matters. The Company is cooperating fully with the respective
authorities. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss which may arise from this matter.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance
that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we may have investments in certain
unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.

In the ordinary course of business, we review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to
improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems and automating manual processes.

An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures was performed as of the end of the period
covered by this report. This evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable
assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules and forms.
