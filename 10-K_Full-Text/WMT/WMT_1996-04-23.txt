ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

          (a)  General Development of Business

                Wal-Mart  Stores,  Inc.  (together  with  its  subsidiaries
hereinafter  referred  to  as the "Company") has become  America's  largest
retailer  and during the fiscal year ended January 31, 1996, had net  sales
of  $93,627,000,000.   The Company serves customers primarily  through  the
operation  of  Wal-Mart stores (discount department  stores),  Sam's  Clubs
(warehouse membership clubs), and Wal-Mart Supercenters (a combination full-
line supermarket and discount department store).  Domestically, the Company
operated   1,995  Wal-Mart  stores,  433  Sam's  Clubs,  and  239  Wal-Mart
Supercenters  as  of  January  31, 1996.  A table  summarizing  information
concerning  domestic  Wal-Mart stores, Sam's Clubs, Wal-Mart  Supercenters,
and other stores operated since January 31, 1991 is set forth in Schedule A
to Item I found on page 9 of this annual report.

               In fiscal 1992, the Company entered into a joint venture, in
which  it  has  a  50% interest with CIFRA, Mexico's largest  retailer,  to
develop and expand retailing services in Mexico.  At January 31, 1996,  the
joint  venture operated 28 warehouse clubs, 25 discount stores, 13 Wal-Mart
Supercenters,  four combination stores, three supermarkets, five  specialty
department stores, and 48 restaurants.

                In fiscal 1993, the Company entered the Puerto Rico market,
and  at  January  31, 1996, operated seven Wal-Mart stores and  four  Sam's
Clubs.

               In fiscal 1995, the Company completed the acquisition of 122
Woolco  department stores located in Canada from Woolworth Canada, Inc.,  a
subsidiary   of  Woolworth  Corporation.   The  acquisition  included   all
inventory,  leasehold  interests and other assets  at  each  location.   At
January 31, 1996, the Company operated 131 Canadian Wal-Mart stores.

                In fiscal 1995, the Company entered into a joint venture in
which  it  has a 60% interest with Lojas Americanas, a leading retailer  in
Brazil,  to develop and operate Supercenters and warehouse clubs in Brazil.
At  January 31, 1996, the joint venture operated two Supercenters and three
warehouse clubs.

                In  fiscal  1996,  the Company entered  Argentina,  and  at
January  31,  1996, the Company operated one Supercenter and two  warehouse
clubs.

                In  fiscal  1996, the Company and Lippo Group of  Indonesia
signed an agreement to open Indonesia's first Wal-Mart Supercenter in early
1996.   The  Company will provide retail expertise and management  services
for  the  operation of the store, and ownership will be held by  the  Lippo
Group.

                A  table  summarizing information concerning  international
units operated since fiscal 1992 is set forth in Schedule B to Item 1 found
on page 10 of this annual report.


          (b)  Financial Information About Industry Segments

                Sales  of merchandise through stores which include Wal-Mart
stores,  Sam's  Clubs,  and Wal-Mart Supercenters is the  only  significant
industry segment of which the Company is a part.  Reference is made to  the
financial  information incorporated by reference in  this  report  for  the
financial results of the Company's operations.


          (c)  Narrative Description of Business

                The  Company,  a  Delaware corporation, has  its  principal
offices in Bentonville, Arkansas.  Although the Company was incorporated in
October  1969, the businesses conducted by its predecessors began  in  1945
when  Sam  M.  Walton  opened  a franchise Ben Franklin  variety  store  in
Newport, Arkansas.  In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar
store  in  Versailles,  Missouri.  Until 1962, the Company's  business  was
devoted  entirely to the operation of variety stores.  In  that  year,  the
first  Wal-Mart Discount City (referred to herein as "Wal-Mart store")  was
opened.   In  fiscal 1984, the Company opened its first three Sam's  Clubs,
and in fiscal 1988, its first Wal-Mart Supercenter.  Through the years, the
Company  has  made certain strategic acquisitions that have  supported  the
growth  of  the  Wal-Mart  stores, clubs  and  Supercenters,  such  as  the
acquisition  of  ten  full service and four specialty distribution  centers
through  the  purchase of McLane Company, Inc., which sells and distributes
merchandise  to  the  convenience store industry and  a  variety  of  other
retailers, the acquisition of selected assets of Pace Membership Warehouse,
Inc.,  and the acquisition of selected assets related to 122 Woolco  stores
in   Canada   from  Woolworth  Canada,  Inc.,  a  subsidiary  of  Woolworth
Corporation.

           General.  The Company operates Wal-Mart stores in all 50 states.
The  average size of a Wal-Mart store is approximately 91,100 square  feet,
and  store sizes generally range between 30,000 and 150,000 square feet  of
building  area.   The Company operates Wal-Mart Supercenter  stores  in  22
states, and the average size of a Supercenter store is 182,000 square feet.

           The Company operates Sam's Clubs in 48 states.  The average size
of  a  Sam's  Club  is approximately 121,000 square feet,  and  club  sizes
generally range between 90,000 and 150,000 square feet of building area.

           The  Company operates Wal-Mart stores, Sam's Clubs and  Wal-Mart
Supercenters  in  Argentina,  Canada and Puerto  Rico,  and  through  joint
ventures in Brazil and Mexico.

           During  the  last fiscal year, no single store or club  location
accounted for as much as 1% of sales or net income.

           Merchandise.   Wal-Mart stores are generally organized  with  40
departments and offer a wide variety of merchandise, including apparel  for
women,  girls,  men, boys, and infants.  Each store also carries  curtains,
fabrics  and  notions,  shoes,  housewares,  hardware,  electronics,   home
furnishings, small appliances, automotive accessories, garden equipment and
supplies,  sporting goods, toys, cameras and supplies,  health  and  beauty
aids, pharmaceuticals, and jewelry.

           Nationally  advertised merchandise accounts for  a  majority  of
sales  of  the stores.  The Company markets lines of merchandise under  the
store  brands  "Sam's  American  Choice", "Great  Value",  "Ol'  Roy",  and
"Equate".   The  Company also markets lines of merchandise  under  licensed
brands;  some of which include "Sports Afield", "House Beautiful", "Popular
Mechanics", "Better Homes & Gardens", "Kathie Lee", and "Bobbie Brooks".

           During the fiscal year ended January 31, 1996, domestic sales of
general  merchandise at Wal-Mart stores and Supercenters (which are subject
to  seasonal variance), including licensed departments, by product category
were as follows:


                                              PERCENTAGE
          CATEGORY                             OF SALES

          Softgoods/domestics..............        25%
          Hardgoods........................        25
          Stationery and candy.............        11
          Records and electronics..........        10
          Pharmaceuticals..................         9
          Sporting goods and toys..........         9
          Health and beauty aids...........         7
          Shoes............................         2
          Jewelry..........................         2
                                                  100%


           Sales in pharmaceuticals are a combination of owned and licensed
departments.    While   these  percentages  include   sales   of   licensed
departments, the Company records as other income only rentals received from
such departments.

           Sam's  offers bulk displays of name brand hardgood  merchandise,
some  softgoods,  and institutional size grocery items.   Each  Sam's  also
carries jewelry, sporting goods, toys, tires, stationery, and books.   Most
clubs have fresh food departments which include bakery, meat, and produce.

          McLane offers a wide variety of grocery and non-grocery products,
including  perishable  and non-perishable items.  The non-grocery  products
consist  primarily  of tobacco products, hardgood merchandise,  health  and
beauty aids, toys, and stationery.  McLane is a wholesale distributor  that
sells  its  merchandise to a variety of retailers, including the  Company's
Wal-Mart stores, Supercenters, and Sam's Clubs.

           Operations.   Except for extended hours during  certain  holiday
seasons,  the  majority of the Wal-Mart stores are open from 9:00  a.m.  to
9:00 p.m. six (6) days a week, and from 12:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. on Sundays,
with  the  remainder of the stores being closed on Sunday.   Some  Wal-Mart
stores and most of the Supercenter stores are currently open 24 hours  each
day.   Wal-Mart stores maintain uniform prices, except where  lower  prices
are  necessary to meet local competition.  Sales are primarily on  a  self-
service, cash-and-carry basis with the objective of maximizing sales volume
and  inventory  turnover  while  minimizing  expenses.   Bank  credit  card
programs,  operated without recourse to the Company, are available  in  all
stores.    Wal-Mart  stores  and  Supercenters  maintain  a   "satisfaction
guaranteed" program to promote customer goodwill and acceptance.

           Sam's  Clubs  are  membership only,  cash-and-carry  operations.
However,  a  financial  service  credit card  program  (Discover  Card)  is
available  in  all clubs and the "Sam's Direct" commercial finance  program
and  "Business  Revolving  Credit"  are available  to  qualifying  business
members.  Also, a "Personal Credit" program is available to qualifying club
members.   Club  members include businesses and those individuals  who  are
members  of certain qualifying organizations, such as government and  state
employees  and credit union members.  Both business and individual  members
have an annual membership fee of $25 for the primary membership card.

           Operating hours vary among Sam's Clubs, but generally  they  are
open  Monday  through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.  Most  Sam's  are
open weekend hours of 9:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Saturday and 12:00 noon  to
6:00 p.m. on Sunday.

           Distribution.  During the 1996 fiscal year, approximately 85% of
the  Wal-Mart  stores' and Supercenters' purchases were shipped  from  Wal-
Mart's  31  distribution centers, five located in Arkansas; five in  Texas;
two  in California, Indiana, New York, and South Carolina; and one each  in
Alabama,  Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,  Mississippi,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin.  The balance was shipped
directly to the stores from suppliers.  Each of the distribution centers is
designed to serve the distribution needs of approximately 80 to 140  stores
depending  on  the  size  of the center.  The size  of  these  distribution
centers  range from approximately 700,000 to 1,600,000 square feet.   Sam's
Clubs  receive  the majority of their merchandise via direct shipment  from
suppliers rather than from the Company's distribution centers.

           The  McLane  distribution  centers  buy,  sell,  and  distribute
merchandise  primarily  to the convenience store industry,  and  they  also
service  Wal-Mart stores, Supercenters and Sam's Clubs.  The McLane Company
has  23  distribution centers with five located in Texas,  two  located  in
Arizona, California, Utah, and Virginia, and one each in Colorado, Florida,
Georgia,  Illinois, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, New York,  Washington,
and Mexico.

           Merchandising.   Substantially all purchasing and  merchandising
for  all  stores is controlled from the home offices of the Company through
centralized buying and planning practices.  During the fiscal year 1996, no
single supplier to the stores accounted for more than 4.3% of the Company's
purchases.

           Store  Management.  Every retail outlet is managed  by  a  store
manager  or  club general manager and one or more assistant store  or  club
managers.   The Company maintains training programs for managers, assistant
managers  and department managers.  The Company is committed to an  ongoing
training  program  in  an  effort  to  assure  well  trained  future  store
management.

           Expansion Plans.  Domestically, the Company plans to open 60  to
70  new Wal-Mart stores and 100 to 110 Supercenters.  Approximately  90  of
the  Supercenters will come from relocations or expansions of existing Wal-
Mart  stores.  The Company also plans to open 10 new Sam's Clubs and  three
distribution centers.  International expansion includes 25 to 30  new  Wal-
Mart  stores,  Supercenters and Sam's Clubs in Argentina,  Brazil,  Canada,
China,  Indonesia, Mexico and Puerto Rico.  The Company expenses its start-
up  costs  for  each  new unit during the first full  month  of  operation.
Delays   may   be  experienced  in  projected  opening  dates  because   of
construction  problems,  weather  and  other  reasons.   There  can  be  no
assurance that planned expansion will proceed as scheduled.

           Seasonal  Aspects  of  Operations.  The  Company's  business  is
seasonal  to  a  certain extent.  Generally, the highest  volume  of  sales
occurs in the fourth fiscal quarter and the lowest volume occurs during the
first fiscal quarter.

           Competition.  The Company's Wal-Mart stores compete  with  other
discount,  department, drug, variety, and specialty stores, many  of  which
are national chains.  Sam's Clubs compete with wholesale clubs, as well  as
with   discount  retailers,  wholesale  grocers,  and  general  merchandise
wholesalers and distributors.  The Wal-Mart Supercenters compete with other
supercenter  type  stores,  discount stores,  supermarkets,  and  specialty
stores,  many  of which are national or regional chains.  The Company  also
competes for new store sites.  As of January 31, 1996, based on net  sales,
the Company ranked first among all retail department store chains and among
all discount department store chains.

          The Company's competitive position within the industry is largely
determined  by  the  Company's ability to offer value and  service  to  its
customers.   The Company has many programs designed to meet the competitive
needs  of  its  industry.  These include the "Everyday  Low  Price",  "Item
Merchandising",  "Store-Within-a-Store",  "Our  Business  is  Saving   Your
Business Money", and "Buy America" programs.  Although the Company believes
it  has  had a major influence in most of the retail markets in  which  its
stores are located, there is no assurance that this will continue.

           Employees (Associates).  As of January 31, 1996, the Company had
approximately  675,000  associates, an  increase  of  approximately  53,000
associates  for  the  year.   Part-time  associates  are  primarily   sales
personnel.  Associates who are in supervisory and management positions  are
compensated  on a salaried basis; store managers and club general  managers
receive  additional compensation based on their unit's profits.  All  other
store associates are compensated on an hourly basis with the opportunity of
receiving   additional   incentive  bonuses  based   upon   the   Company's
productivity and profitability.

          The Company maintains profit sharing plans under which most full-
and  many  part-time associates become participants following one  year  of
employment   with  the  Company.   Annual  contributions,  based   on   the
profitability  of  the  Company, are made at the  sole  discretion  of  the
Company.   For  the  fiscal  years ended January  31,  1991  through  1996,
contributions  of  approximately $98,000,000,  $130,000,000,  $166,000,000,
$166,000,000, $175,000,000 and $204,000,000, respectively, have been made.

           The  Company also offers an associate stock ownership plan  that
provides for the voluntary purchase of the Company's common stock,  with  a
15%  match  by the Company on up to $1,800 of annual stock purchases.   The
Company  also  has  stock  option  plans that  provide  certain  management
associates an opportunity to share in the long-term success of the Company.
At  January  31, 1996, there were approximately 5,000 management associates
who had been granted stock options by the Company.

           The  remaining  buildings  in which its present  stores  are  located
are  either  leased  from a commercial property developer,  leased  pursuant  to
a  sale/leaseback  arrangement,  or  leased from  a  local  governmental  entity
through   an  industrial  revenue  bond  transaction.   All  of  the   Company's
leases  for  its  stores provide for fixed annual rentals and,  in  many  cases,
the leases provide for additional rent based on sales volume.

           The  Company  operated  31 Wal-Mart distribution  facilities  and  23
McLane   distribution  facilities  at  January  31,  1996.   These  distribution
facilities  are  primarily  owned by the Company, and  several  are  subject  to
mortgage  securing  loans.   Some  of  the distribution  facilities  are  leased
under  industrial  development  bond  financing  arrangements  and  provide  the
option  of  purchasing  these  facilities at the  end  of  the  lease  term  for
nominal amounts.

           The  Company  leases  properties on which  Canadian  Wal-Mart  stores
and  Puerto  Rico  Wal-Mart  stores and Sam's Clubs are  located.   The  Company
owns  properties  on  which  the  operating  units  in  Argentina,  Brazil   and
