WAL-MART STORES, INC.

ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2004

PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

Wal-Mart operates retail stores in various formats around the world. Wal-Mart is committed to growing by improving the standard of living for our
customers throughout the world. We earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at every day low prices (“EDLP”) while fostering a culture that rewards and embraces mutual
respect, integrity and diversity. EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so that our customers trust that our prices will not change erratically under frequent promotional activity. During the fiscal year
ended January 31, 2004, we had net sales of $256.3 billion.

Our Wal-Mart Stores segment operations are comprised of three business segments. Our Wal-Mart Stores segment is the largest segment of our business, accounting for 68% of our fiscal 2004 sales. This segment consists of three different
retail formats all of which operate in the United States including:

•

Discount Stores, which average approximately 98,000 square feet in size and offer a wide variety of general merchandise and a limited variety of food products;

•

Supercenters, which average approximately 187,000 square feet in size and offer a wide variety of general merchandise and a full-line supermarket; and

•

Neighborhood Markets, which average approximately 43,000 square feet in size and offer a full-line supermarket and a limited variety of general merchandise.

Our SAM’S CLUB segment consists of
membership warehouse clubs and accounts for 13.5% of our fiscal 2004 sales. SAM’S CLUB is in business for small businesses. Our focus for SAM’S CLUB is to provide exceptional value on brand name merchandise at “member’s
only” prices for both business and personal use. Our domestic SAM’S CLUBs average approximately 127,000 square feet in size.

Our International segment consists of retail operations in eight countries and Puerto Rico. This segment generated 18.5% of our fiscal 2004 sales. The
International segment includes several different formats of retail stores and restaurants, including Discount Stores, Supercenters and SAM’S CLUBs that operate outside the United States. Our international units average approximately 85,000
square feet in size. Additionally, we own an unconsolidated 37.8% minority interest in The Seiyu, Ltd. (“Seiyu”), a retailer in Japan.

We maintain our principal offices at 702 S.W. 8

th

Street, Bentonville, Arkansas 72716.

The Development of Our Company

Although
Wal-Mart was incorporated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a
similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders’ business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a Discount Store, was opened. In fiscal 1984, we opened
our first three SAM’S CLUBs, and in fiscal 1988, we opened our first Supercenter.

In fiscal 1992, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico, in which we had a 50% interest, with Cifra S.A. de C.V. (“Cifra”). In fiscal 1998, we acquired the
controlling interest in Cifra, and in February 2000, Cifra officially changed its name to Wal-Mart de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. Since fiscal 1992, our international presence has continued to expand and at January 31, 2004, we had international operations
in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Germany, South Korea, Mexico,


Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom. We also operate through joint ventures in China and through a minority interest in
Japan.

At January 31, 2004, we operated in the United States
1,478 Discount Stores, 1,471 Supercenters, 538 SAM’S CLUBs and 64 Neighborhood Markets. Internationally, at January 31, 2004, the Company operated units in Argentina (11), Brazil (25), Canada (235), Germany (92), South Korea (15), Mexico (623),
Puerto Rico (53) and the United Kingdom (267). We also operate through joint ventures in China (34). Additionally, we hold a 37.8% interest in Seiyu, a Japanese retail chain which operates approximately 400 stores throughout Japan.

Our growth, measured both by our net sales and net income, occurs in large
measure as a result of our domestic and international expansion programs along with comparative store sales increases. We consider comparative store sales to be sales at stores that were open as of February 1st of the prior fiscal year and which
have not been expanded or relocated during that period. Comparative store sales are also referred to as “same-store” sales by others within the retail industry.

The following tables provide summary information concerning the additions of units and square footage for domestic Discount
Stores, Supercenters, SAM’S CLUBs, Neighborhood Markets and international units in each of our fiscal years from 2000 through 2004.

Much of our growth internationally in recent years has resulted from our
acquisition of existing operations in various countries. During May 2002, the Company acquired its initial 6.1% stake in Seiyu, a Japanese retail chain, for approximately $51 million. In December 2002, the Company exercised in full the first in the
series of warrants granted allowing us to acquire 192.8 million new shares in Seiyu for approximately $432 million. After this exercise, our ownership percentage in Seiyu increased to approximately 37.7%. In August 2003, the Company purchased an
additional 20.2 million shares in Seiyu for approximately $38 million bringing our ownership percentage in Seiyu to approximately 37.8%. Under the terms of the agreement, Wal-Mart, through a series of warrants exercisable in specified series through
2007, can contribute approximately 235 billion yen, or $2.2 billion at a January 31, 2004 exchange rate of 105.7 yen per dollar, for additional shares of stock in Seiyu. If all the warrants are exercised, we will own approximately 69.4% of the stock
of Seiyu by the end of December 2007.


In December 2002, the Company completed its purchase of Supermercados Amigo, Inc. (“Amigo”), a
supermarket chain located in Puerto Rico with 37 supermarkets at the time of the acquisition. Six of the supermarkets were subsequently sold.

Subsequent to fiscal year-end 2004, in February 2004, the Company completed its purchase of Bompreco S.A. Supermercados do Nordeste
(“Bompreco”), a supermarket chain in northern Brazil with 118 hypermarkets, supermarkets and mini markets. The purchase price was approximately $300 million. The results of operations for Bompreco will be included in our consolidated
financial statements beginning in fiscal 2005.

We have
provided additional information regarding the accounting treatment of the acquisitions discussed above in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements which appear in our Annual Report to Shareholders and are incorporated by reference
herein and have been included as an exhibit to this Annual Report.

Our
Industry Segments

Our mass merchandising
operations serve our customers primarily through the operation of three segments. We identify those segments based on Management responsibility within the United States and for total international units. The Wal-Mart Stores segment includes our
Discount Stores, Supercenters and Neighborhood Markets in the United States as well as the Wal-Mart.com (www.walmart.com) operation. The SAM’S CLUB segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the United States. The International segment
includes all of our operations in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Korea, Mexico, Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom. Wal-Mart’s portion of the results of our unconsolidated 37.8% minority interest in the Japanese retailer, Seiyu, is
included in the Other segment. You will find information concerning the financial results of our operating segments and the total assets of each of those segments in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition. We have incorporated our Consolidated Financial Statements as of January 31, 2004 and for the year then ended and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well
as Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition by reference herein to our Annual Report to our Shareholders and included them as an exhibit to this Annual Report.

Wal-Mart Stores Operating Segment

The Wal-Mart Stores segment had net sales of $174.2 billion, $157.1 billion
and $139.1 billion for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single Discount Store, Supercenter or Neighborhood Market location accounted for as much as 1% of total Company
sales or net income.

General

We operate Wal-Mart
Discount Stores in all 50 states, Supercenters in 45 states and Neighborhood Markets in 12 states. Our Discount Stores range in size from 30,000 square feet to 220,000 square feet, with the average size of a Discount Store being approximately 98,000
square feet. Supercenters range in size from 100,000 square feet to 261,000 square feet, with the average size of a Supercenter being approximately 187,000 square feet. Neighborhood Market stores range in size from 38,000 square feet to 55,000
square feet, with the average size being approximately 43,000 square feet. Customers can also access a broad assortment of merchandise and services on-line through the internet at www.walmart.com.

Merchandise

Wal-Mart Discount Stores and the general
merchandise area of Supercenters carry apparel for women, girls, men, boys and infants, domestics, fabrics and notions, stationery and books, shoes, housewares, hardware, electronics, home furnishings, small appliances, automotive accessories,
horticulture and accessories, sporting goods, toys, pet food and pet accessories, cameras and supplies, photo processing, health and beauty aids, pharmaceuticals, jewelry and optical. In addition, our stores offer an assortment of grocery
merchandise. The grocery assortment in our Supercenters consists of a full line of grocery items including meat, produce, deli, bakery, dairy, frozen foods and dry grocery. Most of our Discount Stores carry a limited assortment of dry grocery
merchandise while a number of our larger Discount Stores in some markets carry a broader assortment of grocery items, including perishable items. Neighborhood Markets are generally organized into dry grocery, meat, produce, deli, bakery, dairy,
frozen


foods, pharmaceuticals, photo processing, health and beauty aids, household chemicals, paper goods, general merchandise
and pet supplies.

Nationally advertised merchandise accounts
for a majority of sales in the stores. We market lines of merchandise under our store brands including “Sam’s American Choice,” “One Source,” “Great Value,” “Ol’ Roy,” “Puritan,”
“Equate,” “No Boundaries,” “George,” “Athletic Works” and “Kid Connection.” The Company also markets lines of merchandise under licensed brands, some of which include “Faded Glory,”
“General Electric,” “Disney,” “Catalina,” “McDonald’s,” “Mary-Kate and Ashley” and “Starter.”

During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2004, sales in Discount Stores and Supercenters (which are subject to seasonal variance) by product category
were as follows:

Operations

Hours of operation for nearly all Supercenters and an increasing number of Discount Stores are 24 hours each day. Hours of operation for the remaining Discount Stores vary by location, but are generally 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m., six days a week,
and from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. on Sundays. Wal-Mart Discount Stores and Supercenters maintain uniform prices, except where lower prices are necessary to meet local competition. Sales are primarily on a cash-and-carry basis with the objective of
maximizing sales volume and inventory turnover while minimizing expenses; however, we also accept credit cards and pin-based debit cards at all Discount Store, Supercenter and Neighborhood Market locations.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations

The Wal-Mart Stores operating
segment’s business is seasonal to a certain extent. Generally, its highest volume of sales occurs in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday season, and the lowest volume occurs during our first fiscal quarter.

Competition

Our Discount Stores compete with other discount,
department, drug, variety and specialty stores and supermarkets, many of which are national chains. Our Supercenters compete with other supercenter-type stores, discount stores, supermarkets and specialty stores, many of which are national or
regional chains. We also compete with other retailers for new store sites. As of January 31, 2004, based on net sales, the Wal-Mart Stores segment ranked first among all retail department store chains and among all discount department store chains.

Our ability to offer value and service to our customers
largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We employ many programs designed to meet the competitive pressures within our industry. These programs include the following:

•

Everyday Low Price (“EDLP”) – our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so that our customers trust that our prices will not change
erratically under frequent promotional activity;

•

Rollbacks – our commitment to continually pass internal and external cost savings on to the customer;

•

Store Within a Store – a program to provide accountability to assistant managers and department managers as to merchandise planning and overall department performance; and

•

Store of the Community – a program to ensure that merchandise assortment fits the demographic needs of the local community.


In addition to these programs, we believe our broad assortment of merchandise that provides one-stop shopping, our high
in-stock levels that provide confidence to our customers that we will have what they need, and our long operating hours that allow customers to shop at their convenience provide us with an additional competitive advantage.

Distribution

During fiscal 2004, approximately 80% of the
Discount Stores’ and Supercenters’ purchases of merchandise were shipped from Wal-Mart’s 90 distribution centers, of which 34 are general merchandise distribution centers, 30 are grocery distribution centers, seven are clothing
distribution centers and 15 are specialty distribution centers. The specialty distribution centers ship merchandise such as jewelry, tires, optical, product returns, and pharmaceuticals. The balance of merchandise purchased was shipped directly to
stores from suppliers. Additionally, the Company operates three import distribution centers and one distribution center for online orders placed via www.walmart.com. The 90 distribution centers are located throughout the continental United States.
Ten distribution centers are located in Texas, nine in Arkansas; eight in Georgia; five in Indiana; four in each of California, New York and Ohio; three in each of Florida, Missouri, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Virginia; two each in Alabama,
Arizona, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah and Wisconsin; and one each in Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Nebraska, Nevada, Oklahoma, and Oregon. General merchandise is
transported to stores primarily through our private truck fleet. However, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable and dry grocery merchandise.

SAM’S CLUB Operating Segment

The SAM’S CLUB segment had net sales of $34.5 billion, $31.7 billion and $29.4 billion for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002,
respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single club location accounted for as much as 1% of total Company sales or net income.

General

We operate SAM’S CLUBs in 48 states. SAM’S CLUBs facility sizes generally range between 70,000 and 190,000 square feet,
with the average SAM’S CLUB facility being approximately 127,000 square feet. SAM’S CLUB provides to its members a broad assortment of merchandise and services on-line through the internet at www.samsclub.com.

Merchandise

SAM’S CLUB offers bulk displays of name-brand
merchandise, including hardgoods, some soft goods, institutional-size grocery items, and selected private-label items under the “Member’s Mark” and “Bakers & Chefs” brands. Generally, each SAM’S CLUB also carries
software, electronics, jewelry, floral, sporting goods, toys, tires, stationery and books. Most Clubs have fresh departments, which include bakery, meat, produce, floral and Sam’s Cafe. Additionally, a significant number of our Clubs offer
photo processing, pharmaceuticals, optical departments and gasoline stations.

During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2004, sales in the SAM’S CLUB segment, which are subject to seasonal variance, by product category were as follows:

Operations

Operating hours for SAM’S CLUBs are Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Sunday from 11:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Additionally, all Club locations offer a Gold Key program that permits
Business Members to shop before the regular opening hours Monday through Saturday, starting at 7:00 a.m.


SAM’S CLUBs are membership only, cash-and-carry operations. Limited credit facilities are available
to include the “SAM’S Direct” commercial finance program and “Business Revolving Credit” available to qualifying business members. Also, we make a “Personal Credit” program available to qualifying club members and
accept the Discover Card in all Clubs. Credit extended to members under these programs is without recourse to the Company. Club members include businesses and those individuals who are members of certain qualifying organizations, such as credit
union members. In fiscal 2004, business members paid an annual membership fee of $30 for the primary membership card with a spouse card available at no additional cost. In addition, business members can add up to eight business associates for $30
each. The annual membership fee for an individual “Advantage” member is $35 for the primary membership card with a spouse card available at no additional cost. The SAM’S CLUB PLUS Membership program offers additional benefits and
services such as insurance services, roadside assistance, credit card processing, payroll processing, dental discount networks, and 401(k) and retirement programs. The annual membership fee for a PLUS Member is $100.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations

The SAM’S CLUB operating
segment’s business is seasonal to a certain extent. Generally, its highest volume of sales occurs in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday season, and the lowest volume occurs during our first fiscal quarter.

Competition

SAM’S CLUBs compete with other warehouse
clubs, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors. We also compete with other retailers for desirable new club sites. Our ability to offer low prices and quality merchandise
determines our competitive position in the warehouse club industry.

Distribution

During fiscal 2004, approximately 63% of the SAM’S CLUB purchases were shipped from the SAM’S CLUB segment’s dedicated distribution facilities. Suppliers shipped the balance of the SAM’S CLUB
purchases directly to SAM’S CLUB locations. The principal focus of our SAM’S CLUB’s distribution operations is on crossdocking product, while stored inventory is minimized. Crossdocking is a distribution process under which shipments
are directly transferred from inbound to outbound trailers without storage in between. Shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a crossdock facility, sometimes less than an hour. A combination of seven Company owned and operated distribution
facilities and 12 third-party owned and operated facilities constitute the overall distribution structure for the SAM’S CLUB segment. Two of the Company owned and operated facilities are located in Texas with one located in each of Arizona,
Arkansas, Colorado, Minnesota and Indiana. Of the third-party owned and operated facilities, one of each is located in California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and
Washington. SAM’S CLUB uses a combination of our private truck fleet as well as common carriers to transport our non-perishable merchandise from distribution centers to our Clubs. However, we contract with common carriers to transport our
perishable grocery merchandise from distribution centers to our Clubs.

International Operating Segment

Our
International segment is comprised of our operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries in Argentina, Canada, Germany, South Korea, Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom, our operations through majority-owned subsidiaries in Brazil and Mexico and our
operations through joint ventures in China. Wal-Mart’s portion of the results of our unconsolidated 37.8% minority interest in Japanese retailer, Seiyu, is included in the Other segment. The International segment’s net sales for the fiscal
years ended January 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, were $47.6 billion, $40.8 billion and $35.5 billion, respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single location accounted for as much as 1% of total Company sales or net income.

General

Operating formats vary by country, but include Discount
Stores in Canada and Puerto Rico; Supercenters in Argentina, Brazil, China, Germany, South Korea, Mexico, Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom; SAM’S CLUBs in Brazil, Canada, China, Mexico, and Puerto Rico; Superamas (traditional supermarket),
Bodegas (combination discount and grocery store), Suburbias (specialty department store) and Vips (restaurant) in Mexico; Todo Dias (combination discount and grocery store) in Brazil; Neighborhood Markets (traditional supermarkets) in China; ASDA
stores (combination grocery and apparel store) and George stores (apparel store) in the United Kingdom; and Amigo supermarkets in Puerto Rico.

Merchandise

The merchandising strategy for the International operating segment is similar to that of domestic segments in the breadth and
scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name


merchandise accounts for a majority of sales, several store brands not found in the United States have been developed to
serve customers in the different markets in which the International segment operates. In addition, steps have been taken to develop relationships with local suppliers in each country to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise.

Operations

The hours of operation for operating units in the
International segment vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. While sales are primarily on a cash-and-carry basis, credit cards or other consumer finance
programs exist in certain markets to facilitate the purchase of goods by the customer.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations

The International operating segment’s business is seasonal to a certain extent. Generally, the highest volume of sales occurs in our fourth fiscal quarter. The
seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different climatic conditions.

Competition

The International operating segment competes with a variety of local, national and international chains in the supermarket,
discount, department, drug, variety, specialty and wholesale sectors of the retail market in each of the countries in which we operate and, in Mexico, with local, national and international restaurant chains. Our ability to offer our customers low
prices on quality merchandise that offers exceptional value in the International segment determines, to a large extent, our competitive position. In our international units, our ability to effectively operate the food departments has a major impact
on the segment’s competitive position in the markets where we operate.

Distribution

The International segment operates export consolidation facilities in California, Florida and Texas in support of product flow to its Mexican, Asian, and Latin American markets. We operate a
total of 53 distribution facilities that are located in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom and Mexico. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic product to the operating
units. During fiscal 2004, approximately 76% of the International segment’s purchases flowed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the balance of the International segment’s purchases directly to our stores in the various
countries in which we operate. A combination of Company owned and operated distribution facilities and third-party facilities makes up the overall distribution structure for International logistics.

Employees (Associates)

As of January 31, 2004, the Company employed approximately 1.5 million Associates worldwide, with approximately 1.2 million
Associates in the United States and approximately 360,000 Associates in foreign countries. Most Associates participate in incentive programs, which provide the opportunity to receive additional compensation based upon the Company’s productivity
or profitability.

several of which are subject to mortgages granted to secure loans obtained to finance their development. We also lease some of the distribution facilities under industrial development bond financing arrangements that provide us with the option to
purchase those facilities at the end of the lease term for nominal amounts.

We own the office facilities in Bentonville, Arkansas that serve as our home office. We lease an office facility in Brisbane, California that serves as the home office for Wal-Mart.com

We operate our International segment stores and restaurants in a combination

II. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS:

Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires
disclosure of certain environmental matters. The following matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement:

During fiscal 2001, the State of Connecticut filed suit against the Company in the Superior Court for the Judicial District of Hartford alleging various
violations of state environmental laws and alleging that the Company failed to obtain the appropriate permits or failed to maintain required records relating to storm water management practices at 12 stores. In December 2003, the State filed an
amended complaint alleging that the Company also had discharged wastewater associated with vehicle maintenance activities and photo processing activities without proper permits. The suit seeks to ensure the Company’s compliance with the general
permits applicable to those activities.

The United States
Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has alleged that the Company and some of its construction contractors have violated the EPA’s stormwater regulations on specific sites primarily in Colorado and Utah, but also in other parts of
the country. On July 31, 2003, the Company served the EPA with a Notice of Dispute as required by a national consent decree entered into between the Company and the EPA in August 2001. Serving the Notice of Dispute initiated an informal dispute
resolution process in accordance with the terms of the consent decree. The Company also filed a copy of the Notice of Dispute with the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas.


On July 29, 2002, the EPA advised the Company that it had initiated an investigation involving the
Company’s compliance with sections 608 and 609 of the Clean Air Act and regulations promulgated thereunder with regard to the sales of Class I and Class II refrigerant products. The statutes provide that the sales of these products are
restricted to persons and/or entities which are properly licensed. The EPA asserts that, during the relevant time period, the Company made approximately 20 such sales to non-licensed persons and/or entities. The Company has reached an agreement to
settle these allegations without admitting any wrongdoing or violations of the statutes by paying a $400,000 civil penalty and entering into a Consent Decree with the EPA. When approved by the court, the Consent Decree will require that the Company
comply fully with the relevant Clean Air Act sections and regulations in the future.

In August 2003, the Company was served with a grand jury subpoena in connection with an investigation by the Office of District Attorney of Harris County, Texas. The subpoena seeks information related to the waste
disposal activities of one of the Company’s photo processing labs. The Company is cooperating with the investigation.

In the Spring of 2003, an investigation was initiated by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (“FDEP”) in connection with the
Company’s alleged failure to comply with certain rules and regulations governing the ownership and operation of above-ground storage tank systems as set forth in Chapter 62-761, Florida Administrative Code. Negotiations between the Company and
the FDEP to resolve this matter have commenced.

III.
IMMIGRATION MATTER:

On or about October 30, 2003, Wal-Mart was formally advised by the United States Attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania that it was the “target” of a federal grand jury investigation. The notice from the
government did not identify the nature of the allegations against Wal-Mart, but rather generally indicated that Wal-Mart was the target of a grand jury investigation assessing potential violations of Federal law including conspiracy, aiding and
abetting transporting illegal aliens and encouraging illegal aliens to reside in the United States, all for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain, and aiding and abetting the unlawful employment of illegal aliens. Wal-Mart
believes the grand jury investigation relates to its relationship with certain third-party contractors providing floor cleaning services to Wal-Mart and those contractors’ alleged employment of individuals who may be in the United States
illegally. The Grand Jury investigation is on-going. Any potential liability on the part of the Company cannot be determined at this time.

On or about November 10, 2003, a civil action was filed against the Company in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, captioned

Zavala et al. v. Wal-Mart Corporation, et al

., Case No. 03-CV-5309. This complaint asserts claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act, and various statutory causes of action and common law
torts arising from the Company’s relationship with certain third-party contractors responsible for providing floor cleaning services in its stores. Any potential liability on the part of the Company cannot be determined at this time.
