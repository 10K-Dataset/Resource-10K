PART I

ITEM 1.

General

Corporate Structure and Business and Other Information

Exelon is a utility services holding company engaged in the generation, delivery and marketing of energy through Generation and the energy distribution and transmission businesses through ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE.

Business Services

Through its business services subsidiary, BSC, Exelon provides its subsidiaries with a variety of support services at cost, including legal, human resources, financial, information technology and supply management services. PHI also has a business services subsidiary, PHISCO, which provides a variety of support services at cost, including legal, accounting, engineering, customer operations, distribution and transmission planning, asset management, system operations, and power procurement, to PHI operating companies. The costs of BSC and PHISCO are directly charged or allocated to the applicable subsidiaries. The results of Exelon’s corporate operations are presented as



“Other” within the consolidated financial statements and include intercompany eliminations unless otherwise disclosed.

Merger with Pepco Holdings, Inc. (Exelon)

On

March 23, 2016

, Exelon completed the merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement among Exelon, Purple Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon (Merger Sub) and PHI. As a result of that merger, Merger Sub was merged into PHI (the PHI Merger) with PHI surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon and EEDC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon which also owns Exelon's interests in ComEd, PECO and BGE (through a special purpose subsidiary in the case of BGE). Following the completion of the PHI Merger, Exelon and PHI completed a series of internal corporate organization restructuring transactions resulting in the transfer of PHI’s unregulated business interests to Exelon and Generation and the transfer of PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE to a special purpose subsidiary of EEDC.

Generation

Generation, one of the largest competitive electric generation companies in the United States as measured by owned and contracted MW, physically delivers and markets power across multiple geographic regions through its customer-facing business, Constellation. Constellation sells electricity and natural gas, including renewable energy, in competitive energy markets to both wholesale and retail customers.  Generation leverages its energy generation portfolio to ensure delivery of energy to both wholesale and retail customers under long-term and short-term contracts, and in wholesale power markets. Generation operates in well-developed energy markets and employs an integrated hedging strategy to manage commodity price volatility. Generation's fleet also provides geographic and supply source diversity. Generation’s customers include distribution utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, financial institutions, and commercial, industrial, governmental, and residential customers in competitive markets.  Generation’s customer-facing activities foster development and delivery of other innovative energy-related products and services for its customers.

Generation is a public utility under the Federal Power Act and is subject to FERC’s exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. Under the Federal Power Act, FERC has the authority to grant or deny market-based rates for sales of energy, capacity and ancillary services to ensure that such sales are just and reasonable. FERC’s jurisdiction over ratemaking includes the authority to suspend the market-based rates of utilities and set cost-based rates should FERC find that its previous grant of market-based rates authority is no longer just and reasonable. Other matters subject to FERC jurisdiction include, but are not limited to, third-party financings; review of mergers; dispositions of jurisdictional facilities and acquisitions of securities of another public utility or an existing operational generating facility; affiliate transactions; intercompany financings and cash management arrangements; certain internal corporate reorganizations; and certain holding company acquisitions of public utility and holding company securities.

RTOs and ISOs exist in a number of regions to provide transmission service across multiple transmission systems. FERC has approved PJM, MISO, ISO-NE and SPP as RTOs and CAISO and NYISO as ISOs. These entities are responsible for regional planning, managing transmission congestion, developing wholesale markets for energy and capacity, maintaining reliability, market monitoring, the scheduling of physical power sales brokered through ICE and NYMEX and the elimination or reduction of redundant transmission charges imposed by multiple transmission providers when wholesale customers take transmission service across several transmission systems. ERCOT is not subject to regulation by FERC but performs a similar function in Texas to that performed by RTOs in markets regulated by FERC.

Specific operations of Generation are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other Federal, state, regional and local agencies, including the NRC and Federal and state environmental protection agencies. Additionally, Generation is subject to NERC mandatory reliability standards, which protect the nation’s bulk power system against potential disruptions from cyber and physical security breaches.

Acquisitions and Dispositions

Disposition of Oyster Creek.

On

July 1, 2019, Generation completed the sale with Holtec International (Holtec) and its indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Oyster Creek Environmental Protection, LLC (OCEP), of Oyster Creek located in Forked River, New Jersey, which permanently ceased generation operations on September 17, 2018.



Disposition of EGTP and Acquisition of Handley Generating Station.

On November 7, 2017, EGTP and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. As a result of the bankruptcy filing, EGTP’s assets and liabilities were deconsolidated from Exelon and Generation's consolidated financial statements. The Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings were finalized on April 17, 2018, resulting in the ownership of EGTP assets (other than the Handley Generating Station) being transferred to EGTP's lenders.

On April 4, 2018, Generation acquired the Handley Generating Station in conjunction with the EGTP Chapter 11 proceedings for a total purchase price of $62 million.

Acquisition of FitzPatrick.

On March 31, 2017, Generation acquired the single-unit FitzPatrick plant located in Scriba, New York from Entergy for a total purchase price consideration of

$289 million

, resulting in an after-tax bargain purchase gain of

$233 million

in 2017.

Acquisition of ConEdison Solutions.

On September 1, 2016, Generation acquired ConEdison Solutions for a purchase price of $257 million, including net working capital of $204 million. The renewable energy, sustainable services and energy efficiency businesses of ConEdison were excluded from the transaction.

See “Fuel” for sources of fuels used in electric generation.

(b)

Net generation capacity is stated at proportionate ownership share. See

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

—Generation for additional information.

(c)

Includes wind, hydroelectric, solar and biomass generation.

(d)

Electric supply procured under site specific agreements.

Generation has five reportable segments, as described in the table below, representing the different geographical areas in which Generation’s generating resources are located and Generation's customer-facing activities are conducted.



Nuclear Facilities

Generation has ownership interests in thirteen nuclear generating stations currently in service, consisting of 23 units with an aggregate of

18,872

MW of capacity. Generation wholly owns all of its nuclear generating stations, except for undivided ownership interests in three jointly-owned nuclear stations: Quad Cities (

75%

ownership), Peach Bottom (

50%

ownership), and Salem (

42.59%

ownership), which are consolidated in Exelon’s and Generation's financial statements relative to its proportionate ownership interest in each unit, and a

50.01%

membership interest in CENG, a joint venture with EDF, which wholly owns the Calvert Cliffs and Ginna nuclear stations and Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in addition to an 82% undivided ownership interest in Nine Mile Point Unit 2. CENG is 100% consolidated in Exelon's and Generation's financial statements.

Generation and EDF entered into a Put Option Agreement on April 1, 2014, pursuant to which EDF has an option to sell its 49.99% equity interest in CENG to Generation. The put option became exercisable on January 1, 2016 and may be exercised any time until June 30, 2022. On November 20, 2019, Generation received notice of EDF’s intention to exercise the put option and sell its ownership share in CENG to Generation. Under the terms of the Put Option Agreement, the purchase price is to be determined by agreement of the parties, or absent such agreement, by a third-party arbitration process. The transaction will require approval of the NYPSC, the FERC and the NRC. The process and regulatory approvals could take one to two years or more to complete.

electric supply (in GWh) generated from the nuclear generating facilities was

64%

,

68%

and

69%

, respectively, of Generation’s total electric supply, which also includes fossil, hydroelectric and renewable generation and electric supply purchased for resale. Generation’s wholesale and retail power marketing activities are, in part, supplied by the output from the nuclear generating stations. See

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

for additional information of Generation’s electric supply sources.

Nuclear Operations

Capacity factors, which are significantly affected by the number and duration of refueling and non-refueling outages, can have a significant impact on Generation’s results of operations. Generation’s operations from its nuclear plants have historically had minimal environmental impact and the plants have a safe operating history.

During


,


and


, the nuclear generating facilities operated by Generation achieved capacity factors of

95.7%

,

94.6%

and

94.1%

, respectively. The capacity factors reflect ownership percentage of stations operated by Generation. Generation manages its scheduled refueling outages to minimize their duration and to maintain high nuclear generating capacity factors, resulting in a stable generation base for Generation’s wholesale and retail power marketing activities. During scheduled refueling outages, Generation performs maintenance and equipment upgrades in order to minimize the occurrence of unplanned outages and to maintain safe, reliable operations.

In addition to the maintenance and equipment upgrades performed by Generation during scheduled refueling outages, Generation has extensive operating and security procedures in place to ensure the safe operation of the nuclear units. Generation also has extensive safety systems in place to protect the plant, personnel and surrounding area in the unlikely event of an accident or other incident.

Regulation of Nuclear Power Generation

Generation is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC with respect to the operation of its nuclear generating stations, including the licensing for operation of each unit. The NRC subjects nuclear generating stations to continuing review and regulation covering, among other things, operations, maintenance, emergency planning, security and environmental and radiological aspects of those stations. As part of its reactor oversight process, the NRC continuously assesses unit performance indicators and inspection results and communicates its assessment on a semi-annual basis. All nuclear generating stations operated by Generation are categorized by the NRC in the Licensee Response Column, which is the highest of five performance bands. The NRC may modify, suspend or revoke operating licenses and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, the regulations



under such Act or the terms of the operating licenses. Changes in regulations by the NRC may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures and/or operating costs for nuclear generating facilities.

Licenses

Generation has original 40-year operating licenses from the NRC for each of its nuclear units and has received 20-year operating license renewals from the NRC for all its nuclear units except Clinton. Additionally, PSEG has received 20-year operating license renewals for Salem Units 1 and 2.

The following table summarizes the current license expiration dates for Generation’s operating nuclear facilities in service:

__________

(a)

Denotes year in which nuclear unit began commercial operations.

(b)

Although timing has been delayed, Generation currently plans to seek license renewal for Clinton and has notified the NRC that any license renewal application would not be filed until the first quarter of 2024. In 2019, the NRC approved a change of the operating license expiration for Clinton from 2026 to 2027.

(c)

On July 10, 2018, Generation submitted a second 20-year license renewal application to NRC for Peach Bottom Units 2 and 3. See Note


-

Regulatory Matters

of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

The operating license renewal process takes approximately four to five years from the commencement of the renewal process, which includes approximately two years for Generation to develop the application and approximately two years for the NRC to review the application. To date, each granted license renewal has been for 20 years beyond the original operating license expiration. Depreciation provisions are based on the estimated useful lives of the stations, which reflect the first renewal of the operating licenses for all of Generation’s operating nuclear generating stations except for Clinton and Peach Bottom. Clinton depreciation provisions are based on an estimated useful life of 2027 which is the last year of the Illinois ZES. Peach Bottom depreciation provisions are based on estimated



useful life of 2053 and 2054 for Unit 2 and Unit 3, respectively, which reflects the anticipated second renewal of its operating licenses. See Note

Nuclear Waste Storage and Disposal

There are no facilities for the reprocessing or permanent disposal of SNF currently in operation in the United States, nor has the NRC licensed any such facilities. Generation currently stores all SNF generated by its nuclear generating facilities on-site in storage pools or in dry cask storage facilities. Since Generation’s SNF storage pools generally do not have sufficient storage capacity for the life of the respective plant, Generation has developed dry cask storage facilities to support operations.

As of

December 31, 2019

, Generation had approximately

84,700

SNF assemblies (

21,000

tons) stored on site in SNF pools or dry cask storage which includes SNF assemblies at Zion Station, for which Generation retains ownership even though the responsibility for decommissioning Zion Station has been assumed by another party,  and TMI, which is no longer operational. See the Decommissioning section below for additional information regarding Zion Station. All currently operating Generation-owned nuclear sites have on-site dry cask storage. TMI's on-site dry cask storage is projected to be in operation in 2021. On-site dry cask storage in concert with on-site storage pools will be capable of meeting all current and future SNF storage requirements at Generation’s sites through the end of the license renewal periods and through decommissioning.

For a discussion of matters associated with Generation’s contracts with the DOE for the disposal of SNF, see Note

Commitments and Contingencies

of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

As a by-product of their operations, nuclear generating units produce LLRW. LLRW is accumulated at each generating station and permanently disposed of at licensed disposal facilities. The Federal Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980 provides that states may enter into agreements to provide regional disposal facilities for LLRW and restrict use of those facilities to waste generated within the region. Illinois and Kentucky have entered into such an agreement, although neither state currently has an operational site and none is anticipated to be operational until after 2020.

Generation ships its Class A LLRW, which represents

93%

of LLRW generated at its stations, to disposal facilities in Utah and South Carolina, which have enough storage capacity to store all Class A LLRW for the life of all stations in Generation's nuclear fleet. The disposal facility in South Carolina at present is only receiving LLRW from LLRW generators in South Carolina, New Jersey (which includes Salem) and Connecticut.

Generation utilizes on-site storage capacity at all its stations to store and stage for shipping Class B and Class C LLRW. Generation has a contract through 2032 to ship Class B and Class C LLRW to a disposal facility in Texas. The agreement provides for disposal of all current Class B and Class C LLRW currently stored at each station as well as the Class B and Class C LLRW generated during the term of the agreement. However, because the production of LLRW from Generation’s nuclear fleet will exceed the capacity at the Texas site (3.9 million curies for 15 years beginning in 2012), Generation will still be required to utilize on-site storage at its stations for Class B and Class C LLRW. Generation currently has enough storage capacity to store all Class B and Class C LLRW for the life of all stations in Generation’s nuclear fleet. Generation continues to pursue alternative disposal strategies for LLRW, including an LLRW reduction program to minimize on-site storage and cost impacts.

Nuclear Insurance

Generation is subject to liability, property damage and other risks associated with major incidents at all of its nuclear stations. Generation has reduced its financial exposure to these risks through insurance and other industry risk-sharing provisions. See “Nuclear Insurance” within Note

PROPERTIES

— Generation. Generation is self-insured to the extent that any losses may exceed the amount of insurance maintained or are within the policy deductible for its insured losses. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on Exelon’s and Generation’s future financial statements.



Decommissioning

NRC regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that funds will be available in specified minimum amounts at the end of the life of the facility to decommission the facility. The ultimate decommissioning obligation will be funded by the NDTs. At

December 31, 2019

the fair value of NDTs exceeds the balance of the Nuclear AROs. See

.

Licenses

Fossil and renewable generation plants are generally not licensed, and, therefore, the decision on when to retire plants is, fundamentally, a commercial one. FERC has the exclusive authority to license most non-Federal hydropower projects located on navigable waterways or Federal lands, or connected to the interstate electric grid, which include Generation's Conowingo Hydroelectric Project (Conowingo) and Muddy Run Pumped Storage Facility Project (Muddy Run). Muddy Run's license expires on December 1, 2055.  On August 29, 2012, Generation submitted a hydroelectric license application to the FERC for a new license for Conowingo. Based on the FERC procedural schedule, the FERC licensing process for Conowingo was not completed prior to the expiration of the plant’s license on September 1, 2014. As a result, on September 10, 2014, FERC issued an annual license for Conowingo, effective as of the expiration of the previous license. The annual license renews automatically absent any further FERC action. The stations are currently being depreciated over their estimated useful lives, which include actual and anticipated license renewal periods. See Note

Contracted Generation

In addition to energy produced by owned generation assets, Generation sources electricity from plants it does not own under long-term contracts. The following tables summarize Generation’s long-term contracts to purchase unit-specific physical power with an original term in excess of one year in duration, by region, in effect as of

December 31, 2019

:

Fuel

The following table shows sources of electric supply in GWh for


and


:

__________

(a)

Includes the proportionate share of output where Generation has an undivided ownership interest in jointly-owned generating plants and includes the total output of plants that are fully consolidated (e.g., CENG).  Nuclear generation for


and


includes physical volumes of

35,745

GWh and

35,100

GWh, respectively, for CENG.

(b)

Includes wind, hydroelectric, solar and biomass generating assets.

The cycle of production and utilization of nuclear fuel includes the mining and milling of uranium ore into uranium concentrates, the conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride, the enrichment of the uranium hexafluoride and the fabrication of fuel assemblies. Generation has inventory in various forms and does not anticipate difficulty in obtaining the necessary uranium concentrates or conversion, enrichment or fabrication services to meet the nuclear fuel requirements of its nuclear units.

Natural gas is procured through long-term and short-term contracts, as well as spot-market purchases. Fuel oil inventories are managed so that in the winter months sufficient volumes of fuel are available in the event of extreme weather conditions and during the remaining months to take advantage of favorable market pricing.

Generation uses financial instruments to mitigate price risk associated with certain commodity price exposures, using both over-the-counter and exchange-traded instruments. See

Derivative Financial Instruments

of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding derivative financial instruments.

Power Marketing

Generation’s integrated business operations include physical delivery and marketing of power.  Generation largely obtains physical power supply from its owned and contracted generation in multiple geographic regions. The



commodity risks associated with the output from owned and contracted generation is managed using various commodity transactions including sales to customers. The main objective is to obtain low-cost energy supply to meet physical delivery obligations to both wholesale and retail customers. Generation sells electricity, natural gas and other energy related products and solutions to various customers, including distribution utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, and commercial, industrial, governmental and residential customers in competitive markets. Where necessary, Generation may also purchase transmission service to ensure that it has reliable transmission capacity to physically move its power supplies to meet customer delivery needs.

Price and Supply Risk Management

Generation also manages the price and supply risks for energy and fuel associated with generation assets and the risks of power marketing activities. Generation implements a three-year ratable sales plan to align its hedging strategy with its financial objectives. Generation may also enter into transactions that are outside of this ratable sales plan. Generation is exposed to commodity price risk in


and beyond for portions of its electricity portfolio that are unhedged. As of

December 31, 2019

, the percentage of expected generation hedged for the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York and ERCOT reportable segments is

91%

-

94%

and

61%

-

64%

for


and


, respectively. The percentage of expected generation hedged is the amount of equivalent sales divided by the expected generation. Expected generation is the volume of energy that best represents our commodity position in energy markets from owned or contracted generation based upon a simulated dispatch model that makes assumptions regarding future market conditions, which are calibrated to market quotes for power, fuel, load following products and options. Equivalent sales represent all hedging products, which include economic hedges and certain non-derivative contracts, including sales to the Utility Registrants to serve their retail load. A portion of Generation’s hedging strategy may be implemented through the use of fuel products based on assumed correlations between power and fuel prices. The risk management group and Exelon’s RMC monitor the financial risks of the wholesale and retail power marketing activities. Generation also uses financial and commodity contracts for proprietary trading purposes, but this activity accounts for only a small portion of Generation’s efforts. The proprietary trading portfolio is subject to a risk management policy that includes stringent risk management limits.  See

ITEM 7A.

Utility Registrants

Utility Operations

Service Territories and Franchise Agreements

The following table presents the size of service territories, populations of each service territory and the number of customers within each service territory for the Utility Registrants as of

December 31, 2019

:

The Utility Registrants have the necessary authorizations to perform their current business of providing regulated electric and natural gas distribution services in the various municipalities and territories in which they now supply such services.  These authorizations include charters, franchises, permits, and certificates of public convenience issued by local and state governments and state utility commissions.  ComEd's, BGE's (gas), Pepco DC's and ACE's rights are generally non-exclusive while PECO's, BGE's (electric), Pepco MD's and DPL's rights are generally exclusive.  Certain authorizations are perpetual while others have varying expiration dates.  The Utility Registrants anticipate working with the appropriate governmental bodies to extend or replace the authorizations prior to their expirations.

Utility Regulations

State utility commissions regulate the Utility Registrants' electric and gas distribution rates and service, issuances of certain securities, and certain other aspects of the business.  The following table outlines the state commissions responsible for utility oversight.



The Utility Registrants are public utilities under the Federal Power Act subject to regulation by FERC related to transmission rates and certain other aspects of the utilities' business.  The U.S. Department of Transportation also regulates pipeline safety and other areas of gas operations for PECO, BGE and DPL.  Additionally, the Utility Registrants are subject to NERC mandatory reliability standards, which protect the nation's bulk power system against potential disruptions from cyber and physical security breaches.

Seasonality Impacts on Delivery Volumes

The Utility Registrants' electric distribution volumes are generally higher during the summer and winter months when temperature extremes create demand for either summer cooling or winter heating. For PECO, BGE and DPL, natural gas distribution volumes are generally higher during the winter months when cold temperatures create demand for winter heating.

ComEd, BGE, Pepco and DPL Maryland have electric distribution decoupling mechanisms and BGE has a natural gas decoupling mechanism that eliminate the favorable and unfavorable impacts of weather and customer usage patterns on electric distribution and natural gas delivery volumes. As a result, ComEd’s, BGE’s, Pepco’s and DPL’s Maryland electric distribution revenues and BGE's natural gas distribution revenues are not materially impacted by delivery volumes. PECO’s electric distribution revenues and natural gas distribution revenues, ACE’s electric distribution revenues and DPL’s Delaware electric distribution and natural gas revenues are impacted by delivery volumes.

Electric and Natural Gas Distribution Services

The Utility Registrants are allowed to recover reasonable costs and fair and prudent capital expenditures associated with electric and natural gas distribution services and earn a return on those capital expenditures, subject to commission approval. ComEd recovers costs through a performance-based rate formula. ComEd is required to file an update to the performance-based rate formula on an annual basis. PECO's, BGE’s and DPL's electric and gas distribution costs and Pepco's and ACE's electric distribution costs are recovered through traditional rate case proceedings. In certain instances, the Utility Registrants use specific recovery mechanisms as approved by their respective regulatory agencies.

ComEd, Pepco and ACE customers have the choice to purchase electricity, and PECO, BGE and DPL customers have the choice to purchase electricity and natural gas from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers. The Utility Registrants remain the distribution service providers for all customers and are obligated to deliver electricity and natural gas to customers in their respective service territories while charging a regulated rate for distribution service. In addition, the Utility Registrants also retain significant default service obligations to provide electricity to certain groups of customers in their respective service areas who do not choose a competitive electric generation supplier. PECO and BGE also retain significant default service obligations to provide natural gas to certain groups of customers in their respective service areas who do not choose a competitive natural gas supplier. For natural gas, DPL does not retain default service obligations for its residential customers.

For customers that choose to purchase electric generation or natural gas from competitive suppliers, the Utility Registrants act as the billing agent and therefore do not record Operating revenues or Purchased power and fuel expense related to the electricity and/or natural gas. For customers that choose to purchase electric generation or natural gas from a Utility Registrant, the Utility Registrants are permitted to recover the electricity and natural gas procurement costs without mark-up and therefore record equal and offsetting amounts of Operating revenues and Purchased power and fuel expense related to the electricity and/or natural gas.  As a result, fluctuations in electricity or natural gas sales and procurement costs have no impact on the Utility Registrants’ Revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense, which is a non-GAAP measure used to evaluate operational performance, or Net Income.

Procurement-Related Proceedings

The Utility Registrants' electric supply for its customers is primarily procured through contracts as required by their respective state commissions.  The Utility Registrants procure electricity supply from various approved bidders, including Generation. RTO spot market purchases and sales are utilized to balance the utility electric load and



supply as required. Charges incurred for electric supply procured through contracts with Generation are included in Purchased power from affiliates on the Utility Registrants' Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

PECO's, BGE’s and DPL's natural gas supplies are purchased from a number of suppliers for terms of up to three years. PECO, BGE and DPL have annual firm supply and transportation contracts of

132,000

mmcf,

129,000

mmcf and

58,000

mmcf, respectively.  In addition, to supplement gas supply at times of heavy winter demands and in the event of temporary emergencies, PECO, BGE and DPL have available storage capacity from the following sources:

PECO, BGE and DPL have long-term interstate pipeline contracts and also participate in the interstate markets by releasing pipeline capacity or bundling pipeline capacity with gas for off-system sales. Off-system gas sales are low-margin direct sales of gas to wholesale suppliers of natural gas. Earnings from these activities are shared between the utilities and customers. PECO, BGE and DPL make these sales as part of a program to balance its supply and cost of natural gas. The off-system gas sales are not material to PECO, BGE and DPL.

Transmission Services

Under FERC’s open access transmission policy, the Utility Registrants, as owners of transmission facilities, are required to provide open access to their transmission facilities under filed tariffs at cost-based rates approved by FERC. The Utility Registrants and their affiliates are required to comply with FERC’s Standards of Conduct regulation governing the communication of non-public transmission information between the transmission owner’s employees and wholesale merchant employees.

PJM is the regional grid operator and operates pursuant to FERC-approved tariffs. PJM is the transmission provider under, and the administrator of, the PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff (PJM Tariff).  PJM operates the PJM energy, capacity and other markets, and, through central dispatch, controls the day-to-day operations of the bulk power system for the region. The Utility Registrants are members of PJM and provide regional transmission service pursuant to the PJM Tariff. The Utility Registrants and the other transmission owners in PJM have turned over control



of their transmission facilities to PJM, and their transmission systems are under the dispatch control of PJM. Under the PJM Tariff, transmission service is provided on a region-wide, open-access basis using the transmission facilities of the PJM transmission owners at rates based on the costs of transmission service.

The Utility Registrants' transmission rates are established based on a formula that was approved by FERC as shown below:

Environmental Regulation

General

The Registrants are subject to comprehensive and complex legislation regarding environmental matters by the federal government and various state and local jurisdictions in which they operate their facilities. The Registrants are also subject to environmental regulations administered by the EPA and various state and local environmental protection agencies. Federal, state and local regulation includes the authority to regulate air, water, and solid and hazardous waste disposal.

The Exelon Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the management of environmental matters. Exelon has a management team to address environmental compliance and strategy, including the CEO; the Senior Vice President, Corporate Strategy & Chief Innovation and Sustainability Officer; the Senior Vice President, Competitive Market Policy; and the Director, Safety & Sustainability, as well as senior management of the Registrants. Performance of those individuals directly involved in environmental compliance and strategy is reviewed and affects compensation as part of the annual individual performance review process. The Exelon Board of Directors has delegated to its Generation Oversight Committee and the Corporate Governance Committee the authority to oversee



Exelon’s compliance with health, environmental and safety laws and regulations and its strategies and efforts to protect and improve the quality of the environment, including Exelon’s internal climate change and sustainability policies and programs, as discussed in further detail below. The respective Boards of the Utility Registrants oversee environmental, health and safety issues related to these companies.

Air Quality

Air quality regulations promulgated by the EPA and the various state and local environmental agencies impose restrictions on emission of particulates, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), mercury and other air pollutants and require permits for operation of emitting sources. Such permits have been obtained as needed by Exelon’s subsidiaries. However, due to its low emitting generation fleet comprised of nuclear, natural gas, hydroelectric, wind and solar, compliance with the Federal Clean Air Act does not have a material impact on Generation’s operations.

See

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

for additional information regarding clean air regulation in the forms of the CSAPR, regulation of hazardous air pollutants from coal- and oil-fired electric generating facilities under MATS, and regulation of GHG emissions.

Water Quality

Under the federal Clean Water Act, NPDES permits for discharges into waterways are required to be obtained from the EPA or from the state environmental agency to which the permit program has been delegated and must be renewed periodically. Certain of Exelon's facilities discharge stormwater and industrial wastewater into waterways and are therefore subject to these regulations and operate under NPDES permits or pending applications for renewals of such permits after being granted an administrative extension.  Generation is also subject to the jurisdiction of the Delaware River Basin Commission and the Susquehanna River Basin Commission, regional agencies that primarily regulate water usage.

Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act

Section 316(b) requires that the cooling water intake structures at electric power plants reflect the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts and is implemented through state-level NPDES permit programs. All of Generation’s power generation facilities with cooling water systems are subject to the regulations. Facilities without closed-cycle recirculating systems (e.g., cooling towers) are potentially most affected by recent changes to the regulations. For Generation, those facilities are Calvert Cliffs, Clinton, Dresden, Eddystone, Fairless Hills, FitzPatrick, Ginna, Gould Street, Handley, Mystic 7, Nine Mile Point Unit 1, Peach Bottom, Quad Cities and Salem.

On October 14, 2014, the EPA's Section 316(b) rule became effective. The rule requires that a series of studies and analyses be performed to determine the best technology available to minimize adverse impacts on aquatic life, followed by an implementation period for the selected technology. The timing of the various requirements for each facility is related to the status of its current NPDES permit and the subsequent renewal period. There is no fixed compliance schedule, as this is left to the discretion of the state permitting director.

Until the compliance requirements are determined by the applicable state permitting director on a site-specific basis for each plant, Generation cannot estimate the effect that compliance with the rule will have on the operation of its generating facilities and its future results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.  Should a state permitting director determine that a facility must install cooling towers to comply with the rule, that facility’s economic viability could be called into question. However, the potential impact of the rule has been significantly reduced since the final rule does not mandate cooling towers as a national standard and sets forth technologies that are presumptively compliant, and the state permitting director is required to apply a cost-benefit test and can take into consideration site-specific factors, such as those that would make cooling towers infeasible.

New York Facilities

In July 2011, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) issued a policy regarding the best available technology for cooling water intake structures. Through its policy, the DEC established closed-cycle cooling or its equivalent as the performance goal for all existing facilities, but also provided that the DEC will select a feasible technology whose costs are not wholly disproportionate to the environmental benefits to be gained and allows for a site-specific determination where the entrainment performance goal cannot be achieved (i.e., the requirement



most likely to support cooling towers). The Ginna, Nine Mile Point Unit 1, and Fitzpatrick power generation facilities have received renewals of their state water discharge permits and cooling towers were not required. These facilities are now engaged in the required analyses to enable the environmental agency to determine the best technology available in the next permit renewal cycles.

Salem

On July 28, 2016, the NJDEP issued a final permit for Salem that did not require the installation of cooling towers and allows Salem to continue to operate utilizing the existing cooling water system with certain required system modifications. However, the permit is being challenged by an environmental organization, and if successful, could result in additional costs for Clean Water Act compliance. Potential cooling water system modification costs could be material and could adversely impact the economic competitiveness of this facility.

Solid and Hazardous Waste

CERCLA provides for immediate response and removal actions coordinated by the EPA in the event of threatened releases of hazardous substances and authorizes the EPA either to clean up sites at which hazardous substances have created actual or potential environmental hazards or to order persons responsible for the situation to do so. Under CERCLA, generators and transporters of hazardous substances, as well as past and present owners and operators of hazardous waste sites, are strictly, jointly and severally liable for the cleanup costs of waste at sites, most of which are listed by the EPA on the National Priorities List (NPL). These PRPs can be ordered to perform a cleanup, can be sued for costs associated with an EPA-directed cleanup, may voluntarily settle with the EPA concerning their liability for cleanup costs, or may voluntarily begin a site investigation and site remediation under state oversight prior to listing on the NPL. Various states, including Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia have also enacted statutes that contain provisions substantially similar to CERCLA. In addition, RCRA governs treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and cleanup of sites where such activities were conducted.

Generation, the Utility Registrants and their subsidiaries are, or could become in the future, parties to proceedings initiated by the EPA, state agencies and/or other responsible parties under CERCLA and RCRA with respect to a number of sites, including MGP sites, or may undertake to investigate and remediate sites for which they may be subject to enforcement actions by an agency or third-party.

Environmental Remediation

ComEd’s and PECO’s environmental liabilities primarily arise from contamination at former MGP sites. ComEd, pursuant to an ICC order, and PECO, pursuant to settlements of natural gas distribution rate cases with the PAPUC, have an on-going process to recover environmental remediation costs of the MGP sites through a provision within customer rates. BGE, ACE, Pepco and DPL do not have material contingent liabilities relating to MGP sites. The amount to be expended in


for compliance with environmental remediation related to contamination at former MGP sites and other gas purification sites is expected to total $

49 million

which consists primarily of $

45 million

at ComEd. The Utility Registrants also have contingent liabilities for environmental remediation of non-MGP contaminants (e.g., PCBs). As of

December 31, 2019

, the Utility Registrants have established appropriate contingent liabilities for environmental remediation requirements.

The Registrants’ operations have in the past, and may in the future, require substantial expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws. Additionally, under Federal and state environmental laws, the Registrants are generally liable for the costs of remediating environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by them and of property contaminated by hazardous substances generated by them. The Registrants own or lease a number of real estate parcels, including parcels on which their operations or the operations of others may have resulted in contamination by substances that are considered hazardous under environmental laws.

In addition, Generation and the Utility Registrants may be required to make significant additional expenditures not presently determinable for other environmental remediation costs.

Global Climate Change

Exelon has utility and generation assets, and customers, that are and will be further subject to the impacts of climate change.  Accordingly, Exelon is engaged in a variety of initiatives to understand and mitigate these impacts, including investments in resiliency, partnering with federal, state and local governments to minimize impacts, and, importantly, advocating for public policy that reduces emissions that cause climate change.  Exelon, as a producer of electricity from predominantly low- and zero-carbon generating facilities (such as nuclear, hydroelectric, natural gas, wind and solar photovoltaic), has a relatively small GHG emission profile, or carbon footprint, compared to other domestic generators of electricity (Exelon neither owns nor operates any coal-fueled generating assets). Exelon's natural gas and biomass fired generating plants produce GHG emissions, most notably, CO2. However, Generation’s owned-asset emission intensity, or rate of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO


e) emitted per unit of electricity generated, is among the lowest in the industry. Other GHG emission sources at Exelon include natural gas (methane) leakage on the natural gas systems, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) leakage from electric transmission and distribution operations, refrigerant leakage from chilling and cooling equipment, and fossil fuel combustion in motor vehicles. Exelon facilities and operations are subject to the global impacts of climate change and Exelon believes its operations could be significantly affected by the physical risks of climate change. See

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

for additional information.

Climate Change Regulation

Exelon is or may become subject to additional climate change regulation or legislation at the federal, regional and state levels.

International Climate Change Agreements.

At the international level, the United States is a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Parties to the UNFCCC adopted the Paris Agreement at the 21

st

session of the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP 21) on December 12, 2015, and it became effective on November 4, 2016.  Under the Paris Agreement, the Parties agreed to try to limit the global average temperature increase to 2°C (3.6°F) above pre-industrial levels.  In doing so, Parties developed their own national reduction commitments. The United States submitted a non-binding target of 17% below 2005 emission levels by 2020 and 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025. President Trump has stated his intention to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, but no formal action has been initiated. A withdrawal would not be effective until November 2020 at the earliest.

Federal Climate Change Legislation and Regulation.

It is highly unlikely that federal legislation to reduce GHG emissions will be enacted in the near-term. If such legislation is adopted, it would likely increase the value of Exelon's low-carbon fleet even though Exelon may incur costs either to further limit or offset the GHG emissions from its operations or to procure emission allowances or credits. Continued inaction could negatively impact the value of Exelon’s low-carbon fleet.

Under the Obama Administration, the EPA finalized its Clean Power Plan regulations to reduce GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants. Subsequently, the Trump Administration EPA proposed regulations on October 16, 2017 to repeal the CPP on the basis that the new Administration believed that the CPP rule went beyond the EPA's authority to establish a best system of emissions reduction (BSER) for existing power plants. On August 31, 2018, EPA proposed its Affordable Clean Energy rule to replace the CPP with revised emission guidelines based on heat rate improvement measures that could be achieved within the fence line of existing power plants.  In June 2019, EPA issued a final rule that repealed the CPP, and finalized the Affordable Clean Energy rule. The Affordable Clean Energy rule is currently being litigated.

Given litigation uncertainty around the final Affordable Clean Energy rule, Exelon and Generation cannot predict the impacts of regulation of existing power plants, or individual state responses to developments related to final resolution of the Affordable Clean Energy rule, or how developments will impact their future financial statements.

Regional and State Climate Change Legislation and Regulation.

A number of states in which Exelon operates have state and regional programs to reduce GHG emissions, including from the power sector.  As the nation’s largest generator of carbon-free electricity, our fleet supports these efforts to produce safe, reliable electricity with minimal GHGs.  Notably, nine northeast and mid-Atlantic states (Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont) currently participate in the Regional Greenhouse Gas



Initiative (RGGI), which is in the process of strengthening its requirements. The program requires most fossil fuel-fired power plants in the region to hold allowances, purchased at auction, for each ton of CO


emissions.  Non-emitting resources do not have to purchase or hold these allowances.

In June 2019, New Jersey was accepted as a RGGI member effective January 2020. In October 2019, Governor Wolf of Pennsylvania issued an Executive Order that directed the

Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection

to begin a rulemaking process that will allow Pennsylvania to join the RGGI, with the goal of reducing carbon emissions from the electricity sector.

Many states in which Exelon subsidiaries operate also have state-specific programs to address GHGs, including from power plants.  Most notable of these, besides RGGI, are through renewable and other portfolio standards.  Additionally, in response to a court decision clarifying the obligations under the Global Warming Solutions Act, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection in 2017 finalized regulations establishing a statewide cap on CO


emissions from fossil fuel power plants (Massachusetts remains in RGGI as well).  The effect of this new obligation and potential for market illiquidity in the early years represent a risk to Generation’s Massachusetts fossil facilities, including Medway and Mystic.  At the same time, the District of Columbia is considering a plan to incorporate the cost of carbon into electricity, via consumption, as well as directly into the cost of transportation and home heating fuels.  Details remain to be developed, but the specifics could have implications for Pepco’s operations.

Regardless of whether GHG regulation occurs at the local, state, or federal level, Exelon remains one of the largest, lowest-carbon electric generators in the United States, relying mainly on nuclear, natural gas, hydropower, wind, and solar. The extent that the low-carbon generating fleet will continue to be a competitive advantage for Exelon depends on resolution of the CPP and Affordable Clean Energy regulations and associated current or future litigation at the federal level, new or expanded state action on greenhouse gas emissions or direct support of clean energy technologies, including nuclear, as well as potential market reforms that value our fleet’s emission-free attributes.

Renewable and Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards

Thirty-nine states and the District of Columbia, incorporating the vast majority of Exelon operations as well as all utility operations, have adopted some form of RPS requirement.  These standards impose varying levels of mandates for procurement of renewable or clean electricity (the definition of which varies by state) and/or energy efficiency.  These are generally expressed as a percentage of annual electric load, often increasing by year.  Exelon's utilities comply with these various requirements through purchasing qualifying renewables, implementing efficiency programs, acquiring sufficient credits (e.g., RECs), paying an alternative compliance payment, and/or a combination of these compliance alternatives.  The Utility Registrants are permitted to recover from retail customers the costs of complying with their state RPS requirements, including the procurement of RECs or other alternative energy resources. New York, Illinois and New Jersey adopted standards targeted at preserving the zero-carbon attributes of certain nuclear-powered generating facilities.  Generation owns multiple facilities participating in these programs within these states.  Other states in which Generation and our utilities operate are considering similar programs.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

Each of the Registrants operates in a complex market and regulatory environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond that Registrant’s direct control. Such risks, which could negatively affect one or more of the Registrants’ consolidated financial statements, fall primarily under the categories below:

Market and Financial Factors

primarily include:

•

the price of fuels, in particular the price of natural gas, which affects power prices,

•

the generation resources in the markets in which the Registrants operate,



•

the demand for electricity, reliability of service and affordability in the markets where the Registrants conduct their business,

•

the impacts of on-going competition, and

•

emerging technologies and business models.

Regulatory and Legislative Factors

primarily include changes to the laws and regulations that govern:

•

the design of power markets,

•

zero emission credit programs,

•

utility regulatory business model,

•

regulations and other standards,

•

environmental policy, and

•

tax policy.

Operational Factors

primarily include:

•

changes in the global climate could produce extreme weather events, which could put the Registrant’s facilities at risk, and the effects of climate change regulation could impact the GHG emissions from the Registrant’s operations,

•

the safe, secure and effective operation of Generation’s nuclear facilities and the ability to effectively manage the associated decommissioning obligations,

•

the ability of the Registrants to maintain the reliability, resiliency and safety of their energy delivery systems, which could affect the operating costs of the Registrants and the opinions of their customers and regulators, and

•

the Registrants face physical and cyber security risks as the owner-operators of generation, transmission and distribution facilities and as participants in commodities trading.

There may be further risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed by the Registrants to be material that could negatively affect its consolidated financial statements in the future.

Market and Financial Factors

Generation is exposed to price volatility associated with both the wholesale and retail power markets and the procurement of nuclear and fossil fuel (Exelon and Generation).

Generation is exposed to commodity price risk for the unhedged portion of its electricity generation supply portfolio. Generation’s earnings and cash flows are therefore exposed to variability of spot and forward market prices in the markets in which it operates.

Price of Fuels.

The spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the marginal cost of supplying the next unit of electricity to the market during that hour. Thus, the market price of power is affected by the market price of the marginal fuel used to generate the electricity unit.

Demand and Supply.

The market price for electricity is also affected by changes in the demand for electricity and the available supply of electricity. Unfavorable economic conditions, milder than normal weather, and the growth of energy efficiency and demand response programs could each depress demand. In addition, in some markets, the supply of electricity could often exceed demand during some hours of the day, resulting in loss of revenue for base-load generating plants such as Generation's nuclear plants.

Retail Competition.

Generation’s retail operations compete for customers in a competitive environment, which affects the margins that Generation can earn and the volumes that it is able to serve. In periods of sustained low



natural gas and power prices and low market volatility, retail competitors can aggressively pursue market share because the barriers to entry can be low and wholesale generators (including Generation) use their retail operations to hedge generation output.

The impact of sustained low market prices or depressed demand and over-supply could be emphasized given Generation’s concentration of base-load electric generating capacity within primarily two geographic market regions, namely the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic. These impacts could adversely affect Generation’s ability to fund regulated utility growth for the benefit of customers, reduce debt and provide attractive shareholder returns.  In addition, such conditions may no longer support the continued operation of certain generating facilities, which could adversely affect Generation's financial statements primarily through accelerated depreciation and amortization expenses and one-time charges. See Note


—

Early Plant Retirements

of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Cost of Fuel.

Generation depends on nuclear fuel and fossil fuels to operate most of its generating facilities. The supply markets for nuclear fuel, natural gas and oil are subject to price fluctuations, availability restrictions and counterparty default.

Market Designs.

The wholesale markets vary from region to region with distinct rules, practices and procedures. Changes in these market rules, problems with rule implementation, or failure of any of these markets could adversely affect Generation’s business. In addition, a significant decrease in market participation could affect market liquidity and have a detrimental effect on market stability.

The Registrants are potentially affected by emerging technologies that could over time affect or transform the energy industry (All Registrants).

Some of these technologies include, but are not limited to, further development or applications of technologies related to shale gas production, renewable energy technologies, energy efficiency, distributed generation and energy storage devices. Such developments could affect the price of energy, levels of customer-owned generation, customer expectations and current business models and make portions of our electric system power supply and transmission and/or distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives. Such technologies could also result in further declines in commodity prices or demand for delivered energy. Each of these factors could affect the Registrants’ consolidated financial statements through, among other things, reduced operating revenues, increased operating and maintenance expenses, increased capital expenditures, and potential asset impairment charges or accelerated depreciation and decommissioning expenses over shortened remaining asset useful lives.

Market performance and other factors could decrease the value of NDT funds and employee benefit plan assets and could increase the related employee benefit plan obligations, which then could require significant additional funding (All Registrants).

Disruptions in the capital markets and their actual or perceived effects on particular businesses and the greater economy could adversely affect the value of the investments held within Generation’s NDTs and Exelon’s employee benefit plan trusts. The Registrants have significant obligations in these areas and Exelon and Generation hold substantial assets in these trusts to meet those obligations. The asset values are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which could fall below the Registrants’ projected return rates. A decline in the market value of the NDT fund investments could increase Generation’s funding requirements to decommission its nuclear plants. A decline in the market value of the pension and OPEB plan assets will increase the funding requirements associated with Exelon’s pension and OPEB plan obligations. Additionally, Exelon’s pension and OPEB plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefit costs and funding requirements. Changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions or changes to Social Security or Medicare eligibility requirements could also increase the costs and funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and OPEB plans. See Note

Retirement Benefits

of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

The Registrants could be negatively affected by unstable capital and credit markets and increased volatility in commodity markets (All Registrants).

The Registrants rely on the capital markets, particularly for publicly offered debt, as well as the banking and commercial paper markets, to meet their financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs. Disruptions in the



capital and credit markets in the United States or abroad could negatively affect the Registrants’ ability to access the capital markets or draw on their respective bank revolving credit facilities. The banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to the Registrants if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time. The inability to access capital markets or credit facilities, and longer-term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could result in the deferral of discretionary capital expenditures, Generation’s ability to hedge effectively its generation portfolio, changes to Generation’s hedging strategy in order to reduce collateral posting requirements, or a reduction in dividend payments or other discretionary uses of cash. In addition, the Registrants have exposure to worldwide financial markets, including Europe, Canada and Asia. Disruptions in these markets could reduce or restrict the Registrants’ ability to secure sufficient liquidity or secure liquidity at reasonable terms.  As of

December 31, 2019

, approximately

23%

,

19%

, and

18%

of the Registrants’ available credit facilities were with European, Canadian and Asian banks, respectively. See Note

Debt and Credit Agreements

of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the credit facilities.

The strength and depth of competition in energy markets depend heavily on active participation by multiple trading parties, which could be negatively affected by disruptions in the capital and credit markets and legislative and regulatory initiatives that could affect participants in commodities transactions. Reduced capital and liquidity and failures of significant institutions that participate in the energy markets could diminish the liquidity and competitiveness of energy markets that are important to the respective businesses of the Registrants. Perceived weaknesses in the competitive strength of the energy markets could lead to pressures for greater regulation of those markets or attempts to replace market structures with other mechanisms for the sale of power, including the requirement of long-term contracts.

If any of the Registrants were to experience a downgrade in its credit ratings to below investment grade or otherwise fail to satisfy the credit standards in its agreements with its counterparties, it would be required to provide significant amounts of collateral under its agreements with counterparties and could experience higher borrowing costs (All Registrants).

Generation’s business is subject to credit quality standards that could require market participants to post collateral for their obligations. If Generation were to be downgraded or lose its investment grade credit rating (based on its senior unsecured debt rating) or otherwise fail to satisfy the credit standards of trading counterparties, it would be required under its hedging arrangements to provide collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash, which could have a material adverse effect upon its liquidity. The amount of collateral required to be provided by Generation at any point in time depends on a variety of factors, including (1) the notional amount of the applicable hedge, (2) the nature of counterparty and related agreements, and (3) changes in power or other commodity prices. In addition, if Generation were downgraded, it could experience higher borrowing costs as a result of the downgrade.  Changes in ratings methodologies by the credit rating agencies could also have a negative impact on the ratings of Generation.

Generation has project-specific financing arrangements and must meet the requirements of various agreements relating to those financings.  Failure to meet those arrangements could give rise to a project-specific financing default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the specific project being required to repay the associated debt or other borrowings earlier than otherwise anticipated, and if such repayment were not made, the lenders or security holders would generally have broad remedies, including rights to foreclose against the project assets and related collateral or to force the Exelon subsidiaries in the project-specific financings to enter into bankruptcy proceedings. The impact of bankruptcy could result in the impairment of certain project assets.

The Utility Registrants' operating agreements with PJM and PECO's, BGE's and DPL's natural gas procurement contracts contain collateral provisions that are affected by their credit rating and market prices. If certain wholesale market conditions were to exist and the Utility Registrants were to lose their investment grade credit ratings (based on their senior unsecured debt ratings), they would be required to provide collateral in the forms of letters of credit or cash, which could have a material adverse effect upon their remaining sources of liquidity. PJM collateral posting requirements will generally increase as market prices rise and decrease as market prices fall. Collateral posting requirements for PECO, BGE and DPL, with respect to their natural gas supply contracts, will generally increase as forward market prices fall and decrease as forward market prices rise. If the Utility Registrants were downgraded, they could experience higher borrowing costs as a result of the downgrade.  In addition, changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have an adverse negative impact on the ratings of the Utility Registrants.



The Utility Registrants conduct their respective businesses and operate under governance models and other arrangements and procedures intended to assure that the Utility Registrants are treated as separate, independent companies, distinct from Exelon and other Exelon subsidiaries in order to isolate the Utility Registrants from Exelon and other Exelon subsidiaries in the event of financial difficulty at Exelon or another Exelon subsidiary. These measures (commonly referred to as “ring-fencing”) could help avoid or limit a downgrade in the credit ratings of the Utility Registrants in the event of a reduction in the credit rating of Exelon. Despite these ring-fencing measures, the credit ratings of the Utility Registrants could remain linked, to some degree, to the credit ratings of Exelon. Consequently, a reduction in the credit rating of Exelon could result in a reduction of the credit rating of some or all of the Utility Registrants. A reduction in the credit rating of a Utility Registrant could have a material adverse effect on the Utility Registrant.

Generation’s risk management policies cannot fully eliminate the risk associated with its commodity trading activities (Exelon and Generation).

Generation’s asset-based power position as well as its power marketing, fuel procurement and other commodity trading activities expose Generation to risks of commodity price movements. Generation buys and sells energy and other products and enters into financial contracts to manage risk and hedge various positions in Generation’s power generation portfolio. Generation is exposed to volatility in financial results for unhedged positions as well as the risk of ineffective hedges.  Generation attempts to manage this exposure through enforcement of established risk limits and risk management procedures. These risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities. Even when its policies and procedures are followed, and decisions are made based on projections and estimates of future performance, results of operations could be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those decisions prove to be incorrect. Factors, such as future prices and demand for power and other energy-related commodities, become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future estimates are made. As a result, Generation cannot predict the impact that its commodity trading activities and risk management decisions could have on its consolidated financial statements.

Financial performance and load requirements could be negatively affected if Generation is unable to effectively manage its power portfolio (Exelon and Generation).

A significant portion of Generation’s power portfolio is used to provide power under procurement contracts with the Utility Registrants and other customers. To the extent portions of the power portfolio are not needed for that purpose, Generation’s output is sold in the wholesale power markets. To the extent its power portfolio is not sufficient to meet the requirements of its customers under the related agreements, Generation must purchase power in the wholesale power markets. Generation’s financial results could be negatively affected if it is unable to cost-effectively meet the load requirements of its customers, manage its power portfolio or effectively address the changes in the wholesale power markets.

The impacts of significant economic downturns or increases in customer rates, could lead to decreased volumes delivered and increased expense for uncollectible customer balances (All Registrants).

The impacts of significant economic downturns on the Utility Registrants' customers, such as less demand for products and services provided by commercial and industrial customers, and the related regulatory limitations on residential service terminations, could result in an increase in the number of uncollectible customer balances. Further, increases in customer rates, including those related to increases in purchased power and natural gas prices, could result in declines in customer usage and lower revenues for the Utility Registrants that do not have decoupling mechanisms.

Generation's customer-facing energy delivery activities face similar economic downturn risks, such as lower volumes sold and increased expense for uncollectible customer balances.

See

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

for additional information of the Registrants’ credit risk.



The Registrants could be negatively affected by the impacts of weather (All Registrants).

Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodities.  Temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase summer cooling electricity demand and revenues, and temperatures below normal levels in the winter tend to increase winter heating electricity and gas demand and revenues. Moderate temperatures adversely affect the usage of energy and resulting revenues at PECO, DPL Delaware and ACE. Due to revenue decoupling, BGE, Pepco and DPL Maryland recognize revenues at MDPSC and DCPSC-approved levels per customer, regardless of what actual distribution volumes are for a billing period and are not affected by actual weather with the exception of major storms.  ComEd’s customer rates are adjusted to eliminate the favorable and unfavorable impacts of weather and customer usage patterns on distribution revenue.

Extreme weather conditions or damage resulting from storms could stress the Utility Registrants' transmission and distribution systems, communication systems and technology, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs and limiting each company’s ability to meet peak customer demand. First and third quarter financial results, in particular, are substantially dependent on weather conditions, and could make period comparisons less relevant.

Generation’s operations are also affected by weather, which affects demand for electricity as well as operating conditions. To the extent that weather is warmer in the summer or colder in the winter than assumed, Generation could require greater resources to meet its contractual commitments. Extreme weather conditions or storms could affect the availability of generation and its transmission, limiting Generation’s ability to source or send power to where it is sold. In addition, drought-like conditions limiting water usage could impact Generation’s ability to run certain generating assets at full capacity. These conditions, which cannot be accurately predicted, could cause Generation to seek additional capacity at a time when wholesale markets are tight or to seek to sell excess capacity at a time when markets are weak.

Long-lived assets, goodwill and other assets could become impaired (All Registrants).

Long-lived assets represent the single largest asset class on the Registrants’ statements of financial position. In addition, Exelon, ComEd and PHI have material goodwill balances.

The Registrants evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used whenever events or circumstances indicating a potential impairment exist. Factors such as, but not limited to, the business climate, including current and future energy and market conditions, environmental regulation, and the condition of assets are considered.

ComEd and PHI perform an assessment for possible impairment of their goodwill at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting units below their carrying amount. Regulatory actions or changes in significant assumptions, including discount and growth rates, utility sector market performance and transactions, projected operating and capital cash flows for ComEd’s, Pepco’s, DPL’s, and ACE’s business, and the fair value of debt, could potentially result in future impairments of Exelon’s, PHI’s, and ComEd’s goodwill.

An impairment would require the Registrants to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset or goodwill to fair value through a non-cash charge to expense by the amount of the impairment. See

The Registrants could incur substantial costs in the event of non-performance by third-parties under indemnification agreements, or when the Registrants have guaranteed their performance. Generation is exposed to other credit risks in the power markets that are beyond its control (All Registrants).

The Registrants have entered into various agreements with counterparties that require those counterparties to reimburse a Registrant and hold it harmless against specified obligations and claims. To the extent that any of these counterparties are affected by deterioration in their creditworthiness or the agreements are otherwise determined to be unenforceable, the affected Registrant could be held responsible for the obligations. Each of the Utility



Registrants has transferred its former generation business to a third party and in each case the transferee has agreed to assume certain obligations and to indemnify the applicable Utility Registrant for such obligations.  In connection with the restructurings under which ComEd, PECO and BGE transferred their generating assets to Generation, Generation assumed certain of ComEd’s, PECO’s and BGE's rights and obligations with respect to their former generation businesses. Further, ComEd, PECO and BGE have entered into agreements with third parties under which the third-party agreed to indemnify ComEd, PECO or BGE for certain obligations related to their respective former generation businesses that have been assumed by Generation as part of the restructuring. If the third-party, Generation or the transferee of Pepco's, DPL's or ACE’s generation facilities experienced events that reduced its creditworthiness or the indemnity arrangement became unenforceable, the applicable Utility Registrant could be liable for any existing or future claims. In addition, the Utility Registrants have residual liability under certain laws in connection with their former generation facilities.

The Registrants have issued indemnities to third parties regarding environmental or other matters in connection with purchases and sales of assets and a Registrant could incur substantial costs to fulfill its obligations under these indemnities.

The Registrants have issued guarantees of the performance of third parties, which obligate the Registrant to perform in the event that the third parties do not perform. In the event of non-performance by those third parties, a Registrant could incur substantial cost to fulfill its obligations under these guarantees.

In the bilateral markets, Generation is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe Generation money or are obligated to purchase energy or fuel from Generation, will not perform under their obligations for operational or financial reasons. In the event the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, Generation could be forced to purchase or sell energy or fuel in the wholesale markets at less favorable prices and incur additional losses, to the extent of amounts, if any, were already paid to the counterparties. In the spot markets, Generation is exposed to risk as a result of default sharing mechanisms that exist within certain markets, primarily RTOs and ISOs. Generation is also a party to agreements with entities in the energy sector that have experienced rating downgrades or other financial difficulties. In addition, Generation’s retail sales subject it to credit risk through competitive electricity and natural gas supply activities to serve commercial and industrial companies, governmental entities and residential customers. Retail credit risk results when customers default on their contractual obligations. This risk represents the loss that could be incurred due to the nonpayment of a customer’s account balance, as well as the loss from the resale of energy previously committed to serve the customer.

Regulatory and Legislative Factors

Federal or state legislative or regulatory actions could negatively affect the scope and functioning of the wholesale markets (Exelon and Generation).

Approximately

70%

of Generation’s generating resources, which include directly owned assets and capacity obtained through long-term contracts, are located in the area encompassed by PJM. Generation’s future results of operations are impacted by (1) FERC’s and PJM's support for policies that favor the preservation of competitive wholesale power markets and recognize the value of zero-carbon electricity and resiliency and for states' energy objectives and policies (2) the absence of material changes to market structures that would limit or otherwise negatively affect Exelon or Generation. Generation could also be affected by state laws, regulations or initiatives to subsidize existing or new generation.

FERC’s requirements for market-based rate authority could pose a risk that Generation may no longer satisfy FERC’s tests for market-based rates.

The Registrants’ are highly regulated and could be negatively affected by regulatory and legislative actions (All Registrants).

Substantially all aspects of the businesses of the Registrants are subject to comprehensive Federal or state regulation and legislation.

Generation’s consolidated financial statements are significantly affected by its sales and purchases of commodities at market-based rates, as opposed to cost-based or other similarly regulated rates and Federal and state regulatory and legislative developments related to emissions, climate change, capacity market mitigation, energy price information, resilience, fuel diversity and RPS. Legislative and regulatory efforts in Illinois, New York and New Jersey



to preserve the environmental attributes and reliability benefits of zero-emission nuclear-powered generating facilities through ZEC programs are or could be subject to legal and regulatory challenges and, if overturned, could result in the early retirement of certain of Generation’s nuclear plants. See Note

Early Plant Retirements

of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

The Utility Registrants' consolidated financial statements are heavily dependent on the ability of the Utility Registrants to recover their costs for the retail purchase and distribution of power and natural gas to their customers.

Fundamental changes in regulations or other adverse legislative actions affecting the Registrants’ businesses would require changes in their business planning models and operations. The Registrants cannot predict when or whether legislative and regulatory proposals could become law or what their effect will be on the Registrants.

Changes in the Utility Registrants' respective terms and conditions of service, including their respective rates, are subject to regulatory approval proceedings and/or negotiated settlements that are at times contentious, lengthy and subject to appeal, which lead to uncertainty as to the ultimate result and which could introduce time delays in effectuating rate changes (Exelon and the Utility Registrants).

The Utility Registrants are required to engage in regulatory approval proceedings as a part of the process of establishing the terms and rates for their respective services. These proceedings typically involve multiple parties, including governmental bodies and officials, consumer advocacy groups and various consumers of energy, who have differing concerns but who have the common objective of limiting rate increases or even reducing rates. Decisions are subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with the approval proceedings. The potential duration of such proceedings creates a risk that rates ultimately approved by the applicable regulatory body may not be sufficient for a Utility Registrant to recover its costs by the time the rates become effective. Established rates are also subject to subsequent prudency reviews by state regulators, whereby various portions of rates could be adjusted, subject to refund or disallowed, including recovery mechanisms for costs associated with the procurement of electricity or gas, bad debt, MGP remediation, smart grid infrastructure, and energy efficiency and demand response programs. In certain instances, the Utility Registrants could agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters, customer initiatives or franchise agreements. These settlements are subject to regulatory approval.  The ultimate outcome and timing of regulatory rate proceedings have a significant effect on the ability of the Utility Registrants to recover their costs or earn an adequate return. See Note

Regulatory Matters

of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

NRC actions could negatively affect the operations and profitability of Generation’s nuclear generating fleet (Exelon and Generation).

Regulatory risk.

A change in the Atomic Energy Act or the applicable regulations or licenses could require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or could result in increased operating or decommissioning costs. Events at nuclear plants owned by others, as well as those owned by Generation, could cause the NRC to initiate such actions.

Spent nuclear fuel storage.

The approval of a national repository for the storage of SNF and the timing of such facility opening, will significantly affect the costs associated with storage of SNF, and the ultimate amounts received from the DOE to reimburse Generation for these costs.

Any regulatory action relating to the timing and availability of a repository for SNF could adversely affect Generation’s ability to decommission fully its nuclear units. Generation cannot predict what, if any, fee may be established in the future for SNF disposal. See Note


—

Commitments and Contingencies

of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the SNF obligation.

The Registrants could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards, including the likely exposure of the Utility Registrants to the results of PJM’s RTEP and NERC compliance requirements (All Registrants).

The Registrants as users, owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system, including Generation and the Utility Registrants, are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by NERC and enforced by FERC.



PECO, BGE and DPL as operators of natural gas distribution systems, PECO, BGE and DPL are also subject to mandatory reliability standards of the U.S. Department of Transportation. The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles. Compliance with or changes in the reliability standards could subject the Registrants to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures. In addition, the ICC, PAPUC, MDPSC, DCPSC, DPSC and NJBPU impose certain distribution reliability standards on the Utility Registrants. If the Registrants were found not to be in compliance with the Federal and State mandatory reliability standards, they could be subject to remediation costs as well as sanctions, which could include substantial monetary penalties.

The Registrants could incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters (All Registrants).

The businesses which the Registrants operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation and legislation by local, state and Federal authorities. These laws and regulations affect the manner in which the Registrants conduct their operations and make capital expenditures including how they handle air and water emissions and solid waste disposal. Violations of these emission and disposal requirements could subject the Registrants to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs for remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties and exposure to third parties’ claims for alleged health or property damages or operating restrictions to achieve compliance. In addition, the Registrants are subject to liability under these laws for the remediation costs for environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by the Registrants and of property contaminated by hazardous substances they generate. Remediation activities associated with MGP operations conducted by predecessor companies are one component of such costs. Also, the Registrants are currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been deposited and could be subject to additional proceedings in the future.

If application of Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act, which establishes a national requirement for reducing the adverse impacts to aquatic organisms at existing generating stations, requires the retrofitting of cooling water intake structures at Salem or other Exelon power plants, this development could result in material costs of compliance. See

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

— Environmental Regulation for additional information.

The Registrants could be negatively affected by challenges to tax positions taken, tax law changes and the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions. (All Registrants).

The Registrants are required to make judgments in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income, real estate, sales and use and employment-related taxes and ongoing appeal issues related to these tax matters. These judgments include reserves established for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken that could be subject to challenge by the tax authorities. See Note

The Registrants could be negatively affected by federal and state RPS and/or energy conservation legislation, along with energy conservation by customers (All Registrants).

Changes to current state legislation or the development of Federal legislation that requires the use of clean, renewable and alternate fuel sources could significantly impact Generation and the Utility Registrants, especially if timely cost recovery is not allowed for Utility Registrants. The impact could include increased costs and increased rates for customers.

Federal and state legislation mandating the implementation of energy conservation programs that require the implementation of new technologies, such as smart meters and smart grid, could increase capital expenditures and could significantly impact the Utility Registrants consolidated financial statements if timely cost recovery is not allowed. Furthermore, regulated energy consumption reduction targets and declines in customer energy consumption resulting from the implementation of new energy conservation technologies could lead to a decline in the revenues of the Registrants. See

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

— Environmental Regulation — Renewable and Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards for additional information.



Generation’s affiliation with the Utility Registrants, together with the presence of a substantial percentage of Generation’s physical asset base within the Utility Registrants' service territories, could increase Generation’s cost of doing business to the extent future complaints or challenges regarding the Utility Registrants' retail rates result in settlements or legislative or regulatory requirements funded in part by Generation (Exelon and Generation).

Generation has significant generating resources within the service areas of the Utility Registrants and makes significant sales to each of them. Those facts tend to cause Generation to be directly affected by developments in those markets. Government officials, legislators and advocacy groups are aware of Generation’s affiliation with the Utility Registrants and its sales to each of them. In periods of rising utility rates, particularly when driven by increased costs of energy production and supply, those officials and advocacy groups could question or challenge costs and transactions incurred by the Utility Registrants with Generation, irrespective of any previous regulatory processes or approvals underlying those transactions. These challenges could increase the time, complexity and cost of the associated regulatory proceedings, and the occurrence of such challenges could subject Generation to a level of scrutiny not faced by other unaffiliated competitors in those markets. In addition, government officials and legislators could seek ways to force Generation to contribute to efforts to mitigate potential or actual rate increases, through measures such as generation-based taxes.

The Registrants could be subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks, which make them vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatory oversight or other consequences (All Registrants).

The Registrants could be the subject of public criticism. Adverse publicity of this nature could render public service commissions and other regulatory and legislative authorities less likely to view energy companies such as Exelon and its subsidiaries in a favorable light, and could cause Exelon and its subsidiaries to be susceptible to less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes, as well as increased regulatory oversight and more stringent legislative or regulatory requirements (e.g. disallowances of costs, lower ROEs).

Legal proceedings could result in a negative outcome, which the Registrants cannot predict (All Registrants).

The Registrants are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising out of their business operations. The material ones are summarized in Note


—

Commitments and Contingencies

of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures, result in lost revenue or restrict existing business activities.

Generation’s financial performance could be negatively affected by risks arising from its ownership and operation of hydroelectric facilities (Exelon and Generation).

FERC has the exclusive authority to license most non-Federal hydropower projects located on navigable waterways, Federal lands or connected to the interstate electric grid. Generation cannot predict whether it will receive all the regulatory approvals for the renewed licenses of its hydroelectric facilities. If FERC does not issue new operating licenses for Generation’s hydroelectric facilities or a station cannot be operated through the end of its operating license, Generation’s results of operations could be adversely affected by increased depreciation rates and accelerated future decommissioning costs, since depreciation rates and decommissioning cost estimates currently include assumptions that license renewal will be received. Generation could also lose revenue and incur increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments. In addition, conditions could be imposed as part of the license renewal process that could adversely affect operations, could require a substantial increase in capital expenditures, could result in increased operating costs or could render the project uneconomic. Similar effects could result from a change in the Federal Power Act or the applicable regulations due to events at hydroelectric facilities owned by others, as well as those owned by Generation.

Exelon and ComEd have received requests for information related to government investigations. The outcome of the investigations could have a material adverse effect on their reputation and consolidated financial statements (Exelon and ComEd).

Exelon and ComEd received a grand jury subpoena in the second quarter of 2019 from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois requiring production of information concerning their lobbying activities in the state



of Illinois. On October 4, 2019, Exelon and ComEd received a second grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois requiring production of records of any communications with certain individuals and entities. On October 22, 2019, the SEC notified Exelon and ComEd that it has also opened an investigation into their lobbying activities.  Exelon and ComEd have cooperated fully, including by providing additional information requested by the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the SEC, and intend to continue to cooperate fully and expeditiously with the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the SEC. The outcome of the U.S. Attorney’s Office and SEC investigations cannot be predicted and could subject Exelon and ComEd to criminal or civil penalties, sanctions or other remedial measures.  Any of the foregoing, as well as the appearance of non-compliance with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, could have an adverse impact on Exelon’s and ComEd’s reputation or relationship with regulatory and legislative authorities, customers and other stakeholders, as well as their consolidated financial statements.

Operational Factors

The Registrants are subject to risks associated with climate change (All Registrants).

Physical plants could be placed at greater risk of damage should changes in the global climate produce unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, unprecedented levels of precipitation and a change in sea level. The Registrants’ operate in the Midwest and East Coast of the United States, areas that historically have been prone to various types of severe weather events, such that the Registrants have well developed response and recovery programs based on these historical events. Still disruption or failure of electric generation, transmission or distribution systems or natural gas production, transmission, storage or distribution systems in the event of a hurricane, tornado or other severe weather event, or otherwise, could prevent the Registrants from operating their business in the normal course.

The Registrants are considering ways to address the effect of GHG emissions on climate change. If carbon reduction regulation or legislation becomes effective, the Registrants could incur costs either to limit further the GHG emissions from their operations or to procure emission allowance credits for Generation’s fossil fuel-fired generation. See

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

— Global Climate Change.

Generation’s financial performance could be negatively affected by matters arising from its ownership and operation of nuclear facilities (Exelon and Generation).

Nuclear capacity factors.

Capacity factors for nuclear generating units, significantly affect Generation’s results of operations. Lower capacity factors could decrease Generation’s revenues and increase operating costs by requiring Generation to produce additional energy from primarily its fossil facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy Generation’s obligations to committed third-party sales, including the Utility Registrants. These sources generally have higher costs than Generation incurs to produce energy from its nuclear stations.

Nuclear refueling outages.

In general, refueling outages are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months. The total number of refueling outages, along with their duration, could have a significant impact on Generation’s results of operations. When refueling outages last longer than anticipated or Generation experiences unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease, and Generation faces lower margins due to higher energy replacement costs and/or lower energy sales and higher operating and maintenance costs.

Nuclear fuel quality.

The quality of nuclear fuel utilized by Generation could affect the efficiency and costs of Generation’s operations. Remediation actions could result in increased costs due to accelerated fuel amortization, increased outage costs and/or increased costs due to decreased generation capabilities.

Operational risk.

Operations at any of Generation’s nuclear generation plants could degrade to the point where Generation must shut down the plant or operate at less than full capacity. If this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes could require significant time and expense. Generation could choose to close a plant rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the plant to full capacity. In either event, Generation could lose revenue and incur increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments.

For plants operated but not wholly owned by Generation, Generation could also incur liability to the co-owners. For nuclear plants not operated and not wholly owned by Generation, from which Generation receives a portion of the plants’ output, Generation’s results of operations are dependent on the operational performance of the operators and could be adversely affected by a significant event at those plants. Additionally, poor operating performance at



nuclear plants not owned by Generation could result in increased regulation and reduced public support for nuclear-fueled energy. In addition, closure of generating plants owned by others, or extended interruptions of generating plants or failure of transmission lines, could affect transmission systems that could adversely affect the sale and delivery of electricity in markets served by Generation.

Nuclear major incident risk and insurance.

The consequences of a major incident could be severe and include loss of life and property damage. Any resulting liability from a nuclear plant major incident within the United States, owned or operated by Generation or owned by others, could exceed Generation’s resources, including insurance coverage. Generation is a member of an industry mutual insurance company, NEIL, which provides property and business interruption insurance for Generation’s nuclear operations. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered from insurers or the nuclear industry, could be borne by Generation. Additionally, an accident or other significant event at a nuclear plant within the United States or abroad, whether owned Generation or others, could result in increased regulation and reduced public support for nuclear-fueled energy.

As required by the Price-Anderson Act, Generation carries the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance,

$450 million

for each operating site. Claims exceeding that amount are covered through mandatory participation in a financial protection pool. In addition, the U.S. Congress could impose revenue-raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay claims exceeding the

$13.9 billion

limit for a single incident.

See Note

Commitments and Contingencies

of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information of nuclear insurance.

Decommissioning obligation and funding.

NRC regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that funds will be available in certain minimum amounts at the end of the life of the facility to decommission the facility.

Generation recognizes as a liability the present value of the estimated future costs to decommission its nuclear facilities. The estimated liability is based on assumptions in the approach and timing of decommissioning the nuclear facilities, estimation of decommissioning costs and Federal and state regulatory requirements. The costs of such decommissioning may substantially exceed such liability, as facts, circumstances or our estimates may change, including changes in the approach and timing of decommissioning activities, changes in decommissioning costs, changes in Federal or state regulatory requirements on the decommissioning of such facilities, other changes in our estimates or Generation’s ability to effectively execute on its planned decommissioning activities.

Generation makes contributions to certain trust funds of the former PECO units based on amounts being collected by PECO from its customers and remitted to Generation. While Generation, through PECO, has recourse to collect additional amounts from PECO customers (subject to certain limitations and thresholds), it has no recourse to collect additional amounts from utility customers for any of its other nuclear units if there is a shortfall of funds necessary for decommissioning. If circumstances changed such that Generation would be unable to continue to make contributions to the trust funds of the former PECO units based on amounts collected from PECO customers, or if Generation no longer had recourse to collect additional amounts from PECO customers if there was a shortfall of funds for decommissioning, the adequacy of the trust funds related to the former PECO units could be negatively affected.

Should the expected value of the NDT fund for any former ComEd unit fall below the amount of the expected decommissioning obligation for that unit, the accounting to offset decommissioning-related activities in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income for that unit would be discontinued, the decommissioning-related activities would be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and the adverse impact to Exelon’s and Generation’s financial statements could be material. Any changes to the PECO regulatory agreements could impact Exelon’s and Generation’s ability to offset decommissioning-related activities within the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income, and the impact to Exelon’s and Generation’s financial statements could be material.

Forecasting trust fund investment earnings and costs to decommission nuclear generating stations requires significant judgment, and actual results could differ significantly from current estimates. If the investments held by Generation’s NDTs are not sufficient to fund the decommissioning of Generation’s nuclear units, Generation could be required to take steps, such as providing financial guarantees through letters of credit or parent company guarantees or making additional contributions to the trusts, which could be significant, to ensure that the trusts are adequately funded and that current and future NRC minimum funding requirements are met.

Asset Retirement Obligations

of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

The Utility Registrants' operating costs are affected by their ability to maintain the availability and reliability of their delivery and operational systems (Exelon and the Utility Registrants).

Failures of the equipment or facilities used in the Utility Registrants' delivery systems could interrupt the electric transmission and electric and natural gas delivery, which could result in a loss of revenues and an increase in maintenance and capital expenditures. Equipment or facilities failures can be due to a number of factors, including natural causes such as weather or information systems failure. Specifically, if the implementation of advanced metering infrastructure, smart grid or other technologies in the Utility Registrants' service territory fail to perform as intended or are not successfully integrated with billing and other information systems, or if any of the financial, accounting, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, the Utility Registrants' financial results could be negatively impacted. In addition, dependence upon automated systems could further increase the risk that operational system flaws or internal and/or external tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect.

Regulated utilities, which are required to provide service to all customers within their service territory, have generally been afforded liability protections against claims by customers relating to failure of service. Under Illinois law, however, ComEd could be required to pay damages to its customers in some circumstances involving extended outages affecting large numbers of its customers, which could be material.

The Registrants are subject to physical security and cybersecurity risks (All Registrants).

The Registrants face physical security and cybersecurity risks.  Threat sources continue to seek to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the electric and natural gas utility industry associated with protection of sensitive and confidential information, grid infrastructure and other energy infrastructures, and such attacks and disruptions, both physical and cyber, are becoming increasingly sophisticated and dynamic.  Continued implementation of advanced digital technologies increases the potentially unfavorable impacts of such attacks. A security breach of the physical assets or information systems of the Registrants, their competitors, vendors, business partners and interconnected entities in RTOs and ISOs, or regulators could impact the operation of the generation fleet and/or reliability of the transmission and distribution system or result in the theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information, including critical infrastructure information, sensitive customer, vendor and employee data, trading or other confidential data.  The risk of these system-related events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify, and while the Registrants have been, and will likely continue to be, subjected to physical and cyber-attacks, to date none has directly experienced a material breach or disruption to its network or information systems or our service operations.  However, as such attacks continue to increase in sophistication and frequency, the Registrants may be unable to prevent all such attacks in the future.  If a significant breach were to occur, the reputation of the Registrants could be negatively affected, customer confidence in the Registrants or others in the industry could be diminished, or the Registrants could be subject to legal claims, loss of revenues, increased costs or operations shutdown.  Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance maintained against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches may not be sufficient to cover losses or otherwise adequately compensate for any disruptions to business that could result.

The Utility Registrants' deployment of smart meters throughout their service territories could increase the risk of damage from an intentional disruption of the system by third parties.

In addition, new or updated security regulations or unforeseen threat sources could require changes in current measures taken by the Registrants or their business operations and could adversely affect their consolidated financial statements.

The Registrants’ employees, contractors, customers and the general public could be exposed to a risk of injury due to the nature of the energy industry (All Registrants).

Employees and contractors throughout the organization work in, and customers and the general public could be exposed to, potentially dangerous environments near the Registrants’ operations. As a result, employees, contractors, customers and the general public are at some risk for serious injury, including loss of life. These risks include nuclear accidents, dam failure, gas explosions, pole strikes and electric contact cases.



Natural disasters, war, acts and threats of terrorism, pandemic and other significant events could negatively impact the Registrants' results of operations, their ability to raise capital and their future growth (All Registrants).

Generation’s fleet of power plants and the Utility Registrants' distribution and transmission infrastructures could be affected by natural disasters and extreme weather events, which could result in increased costs, including supply chain costs. An extreme weather event within the Registrants’ service areas can also directly affect their capital assets, causing disruption in service to customers due to downed wires and poles or damage to other operating equipment. Natural disasters and other significant events increase the risk to Generation that the NRC or other regulatory or legislative bodies could change the laws or regulations governing, among other things, operations, maintenance, licensed lives, decommissioning, SNF storage, insurance, emergency planning, security and environmental and radiological matters. In addition, natural disasters could affect the availability of a secure and economical supply of water in some locations, which is essential for Generation’s continued operation, particularly the cooling of generating units.

The impact that potential terrorist attacks could have on the industry and on Exelon is uncertain. The Registrants face a risk that their operations would be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror. Any retaliatory military strikes or sustained military campaign could affect their operations in unpredictable ways, such as changes in insurance markets and disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil. Furthermore, these catastrophic events could compromise the physical or cybersecurity of Exelon’s facilities, which could adversely affect Exelon’s ability to manage its business effectively. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism, war, natural disasters, pandemic, credit crises, recession or other factors also could result in a decline in energy consumption or interruption of fuel or the supply chain. In addition, the implementation of security guidelines and measures has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased costs.

The Registrants could be significantly affected by the outbreak of a pandemic. Exelon has plans in place to respond to a pandemic. However, depending on the severity of a pandemic and the resulting impacts to workforce and other resource availability, the ability to operate Exelon's generating and transmission and distribution assets could be affected.

In addition, Exelon maintains a level of insurance coverage consistent with industry practices against property, casualty and cybersecurity losses subject to unforeseen occurrences or catastrophic events that could damage or destroy assets or interrupt operations. However, there can be no assurance that the amount of insurance will be adequate to address such property and casualty losses.

The Registrants’ businesses are capital intensive, and their assets could require significant expenditures to maintain and are subject to operational failure, which could result in potential liability (All Registrants).

The Registrants’ businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments by Generation in electric generating facilities and by the Utility Registrants in transmission and distribution infrastructure projects. Equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good utility practices, is subject to operational failure, including events that are beyond the Registrants’ control, and could require significant expenditures to operate efficiently. The Registrants consolidated financial statements could be negatively affected if they were unable to effectively manage their capital projects or raise the necessary capital.  See

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

for additional information regarding the Registrants’ potential future capital expenditures.

The Utility Registrants' respective ability to deliver electricity, their operating costs and their capital expenditures could be negatively impacted by transmission congestion and failures of neighboring transmission systems (Exelon and the Utility Registrants).

Demand for electricity within the Utility Registrants' service areas could stress available transmission capacity requiring alternative routing or curtailment of electricity usage. Also, insufficient availability of electric supply to meet customer demand could jeopardize the Utility Registrants' ability to comply with reliability standards and strain customer and regulatory agency relationships. As with all utilities, potential concerns over transmission capacity or generation facility retirements could result in PJM or FERC requiring the Utility Registrants to upgrade or expand their respective transmission systems through additional capital expenditures.



PJM’s systems and operations are designed to ensure the reliable operation of the transmission grid and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impact on the operations of the other utilities. However, service interruptions at other utilities may cause interruptions in the Utility Registrants’ service areas.

The Registrants consolidated financial statements could be negatively affected if they fail to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce (All Registrants).

Certain events, such as an employee strike, loss of contract resources due to a major event, and an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, could lead to operating challenges and increased costs for the Registrants. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, could arise. The Registrants are particularly affected due to the specialized knowledge required of the technical and support employees for their generation, transmission and distribution operations.

The Registrants could make acquisitions or investments in new business initiatives and new markets, which may not be successful or achieve the intended financial results (All Registrants).

Generation could continue to pursue growth in its existing businesses and markets and further diversification across the competitive energy value chain. This could include investment opportunities in renewables, development of natural gas generation, nuclear advisory or operating services for third parties, distributed generation, potential expansion of the existing wholesale gas businesses and entry into LNG.  Such initiatives could involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, inadequate return on capital, and unidentified issues not discovered during diligence performed prior to launching an initiative or entering a market. Additionally, it is possible that FERC, state public utility commissions or others could impose certain other restrictions on such transactions. All of these factors could result in higher costs or lower revenues than expected, resulting in lower than planned returns on investment.

The Utility Registrants face risks associated with their regulatory-mandated initiatives, such as smart grids and utility of the future. These risks include, but are not limited to, cost recovery, regulatory concerns, cybersecurity and obsolescence of technology. Such initiatives may not be successful.

The Registrants may not realize or achieve the anticipated cost savings through the cost management efforts (All Registrants).

The Registrants’ future financial performance and level of profitability is dependent, in part, on various cost reduction initiatives. The Registrants may encounter challenges in executing these cost reduction initiatives and not achieve the intended cost savings.

Executive Overview

Exelon is a utility services holding company engaged in the generation, delivery, and marketing of energy through Generation and the energy distribution and transmission businesses through ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE.

Exelon has eleven reportable segments consisting of Generation’s five reportable segments (Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York, ERCOT and Other Power Regions), ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE. During the first quarter of 2019, due to a change in economics in our New England region, Generation changed the way that information is reviewed by the CODM. The New England region is no longer regularly reviewed as a separate region by the CODM nor presented separately in any external information presented to third parties. Information for the New England region is reviewed by the CODM as part of Other Power Regions. See Note

.

Net income attributable to common shareholders

increased by

$931 million

and diluted earnings per average common share increased to

$3.01

in


from

$2.07

in


primarily due to:

•

Higher net unrealized and realized gains on NDT funds;

•

Decreased accelerated depreciation and amortization due to the early retirement of the Oyster Creek nuclear facility in September 2018 and TMI in September 2019

and the absence of a charge associated with the remeasurement of the Oyster Creek ARO in 2018;

•

Decreased Operating and maintenance expense at Generation which includes the impacts of previous cost management programs, lower pension and OPEB costs and increased NEIL insurance distributions;

•

A benefit associated with the remeasurement of the TMI ARO in the first quarter of 2019

and the annual nuclear ARO update in the third quarter of 2019;

•

Decreased nuclear outage days;

•

Lower mark-to-market losses;

•

Regulatory rate increases at PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE;

•

Increased electric distribution, energy efficiency and transmission earnings at ComEd;

•

Decreased storms costs at PECO and BGE; and

•

Research and development income tax benefits.

The increases were partially offset by;



•

Lower realized energy prices;

•

Lower capacity prices;

•

Unfavorable weather conditions at PECO, DPL and ACE; and

•

Unfavorable volume at PECO.

Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings.

In addition to net income, Exelon evaluates its operating performance using the measure of Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings because management believes it represents earnings directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items. This information is intended to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of year-to-year operating results and provide an indication of Exelon’s baseline operating performance excluding items that are considered by management to be not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. In addition, this information is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets and planning and forecasting of future periods. Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.



The following table provides a reconciliation between Net income attributable to common shareholders as determined in accordance with GAAP and Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the year ended

__________

Note:

Amounts may not sum due to rounding.

Unless otherwise noted, the income tax impact of each reconciling item between GAAP Net Income and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings is based on the marginal statutory federal and state income tax rates for each Registrant, taking into account whether the income or expense item is taxable or deductible, respectively, in whole or in part. For all items except the unrealized gains and losses related to NDT funds, the marginal statutory income tax rates for


and


ranged from 26.0 percent to 29.0 percent. Under IRS regulations, NDT fund investment returns are taxed at different rates for investments if they are in qualified or non-qualified funds. The effective tax rates for the unrealized gains and losses related to NDT funds were

Transactions and Developments

Utility Rates and Base Rate Proceedings

The Utility Registrants file base rate cases with their regulatory commissions seeking increases or decreases to their electric transmission and distribution, and gas distribution rates to recover their costs and earn a fair return on their investments. The outcomes of these regulatory proceedings impact the Utility Registrants’ current and future results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

Completed Utility Distribution Base Rate Case Proceedings

Pending Distribution Base Rate Case Proceedings



Transmission Formula Rate

The following total (decreases)/increases were included in ComEd's, BGE's, Pepco's, DPL's and ACE's


annual electric transmission formula rate updates.

PECO Transmission Formula Rate

On May 1, 2017, PECO filed a request with FERC seeking approval to update its transmission rates and change the manner in which PECO’s transmission rate is determined from a fixed rate to a formula rate. The formula rate will be updated annually to ensure that under this rate customers pay the actual costs of providing transmission services. PECO’s initial formula rate filing included a requested increase of

$22 million

to PECO’s annual transmission revenue requirement, which reflected a ROE of

11%

, inclusive of a 50 basis point adder for  being a member of a RTO. On June 27, 2017, FERC issued an Order accepting the filing and suspending the proposed rates until December 1, 2017, subject to refund, and set the matter for hearing and settlement judge procedures.

On December 5, 2019, FERC issued an Order accepting without modification the settlement agreement filed by PECO and other parties in July 2019. The settlement results in an increase of approximately $14 million with a return on rate base of 7.62% compared to PECO's initial formula rate filing and allows for an ROE of

10.35%

, inclusive of a 50 basis point adder for being a member of the RTO. The settlement did not have a material impact on PECO's 2017, 2018, or 2019 annual transmission revenue requirements. PECO will update its rates in 2020 and refund estimated  overcollections totaling approximately $28 million related to the amounts billed under the proposed rates in effect since 2017.

Pursuant to the transmission formula rate request discussed above, PECO made its annual formula rate updates in May 2018 and 2019, which included a decrease of

$6 million

and an increase of

$8 million

, respectively, to the annual transmission revenue requirement. The updated transmission formula rates were effective on June 1, 2018 and 2019, respectively, subject to refund.

Cost Management Programs

Exelon continues to be committed to managing its costs. On October 31, 2019, Exelon announced additional annual cost savings of approximately $100 million, at Generation, to be achieved by 2022. These actions are in response to the continuing economic challenges confronting Generation’s business, necessitating continued focus on cost management through enhanced efficiency and productivity.

FERC Order on the PJM MOPR

On December 19, 2019, FERC issued an order directing PJM to extend the MOPR to include new and existing resources, including nuclear, that receive state subsidies, effective as of PJM’s next capacity auction. Unless Illinois and New Jersey can implement an FRR program in their PJM zones, the MOPR will apply to Generation's nuclear plants in those states receiving ZEC benefits, resulting in higher offers for those units that may not clear the capacity market. On January 21, 2020, Exelon, PJM and a number of other entities submitted individual requests for rehearing. Exelon is currently working with PJM and other stakeholders to pursue the FRR option but cannot predict whether the legislative and regulatory changes can be implemented prior to the next capacity auction in PJM. If Generation’s state-supported nuclear plants in PJM or NYISO are subjected to the MOPR without compensation under an FRR or similar program, it could have a material adverse impact on Exelon's and Generation's financial



statements. See Note

Early Plant Retirements

Oyster Creek.

Generation permanently ceased generation operations at Oyster Creek on September 17, 2018. On July 31, 2018, Generation entered into an agreement with Holtec International and its wholly owned subsidiary, Oyster Creek Environmental Protection, LLC, for the sale and decommissioning of Oyster Creek. The sale was completed on July 1, 2019. Exelon and Generation recognized a loss on the sale in the third quarter 2019, which was immaterial. See Note

Three Mile Island.

Generation permanently ceased operations at TMI on September 20, 2019. As a result of the decision to early retire TMI, Exelon and Generation recorded a

$176 million

incremental pre-tax net charge for the year ended

December 31, 2019

primarily due to accelerated depreciation of the plant assets, partially offset by a benefit associated with the remeasurement of the TMI ARO in the first quarter of 2019.

Salem.

In 2017,  PSEG announced that its New Jersey nuclear plants, including Salem, of which Generation owns a

42.59%

ownership interest, were showing increased signs of economic distress, which could lead to an early retirement. PSEG is the operator of Salem and also has the decision-making authority to retire Salem. In 2018, New Jersey enacted legislation that established a ZEC program that provides compensation for nuclear plants that demonstrate to the NJBPU that they meet certain requirements, including that they make a significant contribution to air quality in the state and that their revenues are insufficient to cover their costs and risks. On April 18, 2019, the NJBPU approved the award of ZECs to Salem Unit 1 and Salem Unit 2. Assuming the continued effectiveness of the New Jersey ZEC program, Generation no longer considers Salem to be at heightened risk for early retirement.

Dresden, Byron and Braidwood.

Generation’s Dresden, Byron and Braidwood nuclear plants in Illinois are also showing increased signs of economic distress, which could lead to an early retirement, in a market that does not currently compensate them for their unique contribution to grid resiliency and their ability to produce large amounts of energy without carbon and air pollution. The May 2018 PJM capacity auction for the 2021-2022 planning year resulted in the largest volume of nuclear capacity ever not selected in the auction, including all of Dresden, and portions of Byron and Braidwood. Exelon continues to work with stakeholders on state policy solutions, while also advocating for broader market reforms at the regional and federal level.

CENG Put Option

On November 20, 2019, Generation received notice of EDF’s intention to exercise the put option and sell its

49.99%

equity interest in CENG to Generation and the put automatically exercised on January 19, 2020 at the end of the sixty-day advance notice period. Under the terms of the Put Option, the purchase price is to be determined by agreement of the parties, or absent such agreement, by a third-party arbitration process. Any resulting sale would be subject to the approval of the NYPSC, the FERC and the NRC. The process and regulatory approvals could take one to two years or more to complete. See Note

Conowingo Hydroelectric Project

In connection with Generation’s pursuit of a new FERC license for Conowingo, on October 29, 2019, Generation and MDE filed with FERC a Joint Offer of Settlement that would resolve all outstanding issues between the parties, effective upon and subject to FERC’s approval and incorporation of the terms into the new license when issued. The financial impact of this settlement, along with other anticipated and prior license commitments, would be recognized over the term of the new 50-year license and is estimated to be, on average,

$11 million

to

$14 million

per year, including capital and operating costs. The actual timing and amount of a majority of these costs are not currently fixed and will vary from year to year throughout the life of the new license. Generation cannot currently predict when FERC will issue the new license. See Note

Pacific Gas & Electric Bankruptcy



Generation’s Antelope Valley, a 242 MW solar facility in Lancaster, CA, sells all of its output to PG&E through a PPA. On January 29, 2019, PG&E filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As of

December 31, 2019

, Generation had approximately

$725 million

and

$485 million

of net long-lived assets and nonrecourse debt outstanding, respectively, related to Antelope Valley. PG&E’s bankruptcy created an event of default for Antelope Valley’s nonrecourse debt that provides the lender with a right to accelerate amounts outstanding under the loan such that they would become immediately due and payable. As a result of the ongoing event of default and the absence of a waiver from the lender foregoing their acceleration rights, the debt was reclassified as current in Exelon’s and Generation’s Consolidated Balance Sheets in the first quarter of 2019 and continues to be classified as current as of

December 31, 2019

.

In the first quarter of 2019, Generation assessed and determined that Antelope Valley’s long-lived assets were not impaired. Significant changes in assumptions such as the likelihood of the PPA being rejected as part of the bankruptcy proceedings could potentially result in future impairments of Antelope Valley's net long-lived assets, which could be material. Generation is monitoring the bankruptcy proceedings for any changes in circumstances that would indicate the carrying amount of the net long-lived assets of Antelope Valley may not be recoverable.

Exelon’s Strategy and Outlook for


and Beyond

Exelon’s value proposition and competitive advantage come from its scope and its core strengths of operational excellence and financial discipline.  Exelon leverages its integrated business model to create value.  Exelon’s regulated and competitive businesses feature a mix of attributes that, when combined, offer shareholders and customers a unique value proposition:

•

The Utility Registrants provide a foundation for steadily growing earnings, which translates to a stable currency in our stock.

•

Generation’s competitive businesses provide free cash flow to invest primarily in the utilities and to reduce debt.

Exelon believes its strategy provides a platform for optimal success in an energy industry experiencing fundamental and sweeping change.

Exelon’s utility strategy is to improve reliability and operations and enhance the customer experience, while ensuring ratemaking mechanisms provide the utilities fair financial returns. The Utility Registrants only invest in rate base where it provides a benefit to customers and the community by improving reliability and the service experience or otherwise meeting customer needs. The Utility Registrants make these investments at the lowest reasonable cost to customers. Exelon seeks to leverage its scale and expertise across the utilities platform through enhanced standardization and sharing of resources and best practices to achieve improved operational and financial results. Additionally, the Utility Registrants anticipate making significant future investments in smart grid technology, transmission projects, gas infrastructure, and electric system improvement projects, providing greater reliability and improved service for our customers and a stable return for the company.

Generation’s competitive businesses create value for customers by providing innovative energy solutions and reliable, clean and affordable energy. Generation’s electricity generation strategy is to pursue opportunities that provide stable revenues and generation to load matching to reduce earnings volatility. Generation leverages its energy generation portfolio to deliver energy to both wholesale and retail customers. Generation’s customer-facing activities foster development and delivery of other innovative energy-related products and services for its customers. Generation operates in well-developed energy markets and employs an integrated hedging strategy to manage commodity price volatility. Its generation fleet, including its nuclear plants which consistently operate at high capacity factors, also provide geographic and supply source diversity. These factors help Generation mitigate the current challenging conditions in competitive energy markets.

Exelon’s financial priorities are to maintain investment grade credit metrics at each of the Registrants, to maintain optimal capital structure and to return value to Exelon’s shareholders with an attractive dividend throughout the energy commodity market cycle and through stable earnings growth.



As part of its strategic business planning process, Exelon routinely reviews its hedging policy, dividend policy, operating and capital costs, capital spending plans, strength of its balance sheet and credit metrics, and sufficiency of its liquidity position, by performing various stress tests with differing variables, such as commodity price movements, increases in margin-related transactions, changes in hedging practices, and the impacts of hypothetical credit downgrades.

Exelon’s Board of Directors approved a dividend policy providing a raise of

5%

each year for the period covering 2018 through 2020, beginning with the March 2018 dividend.

Various market, financial, regulatory, legislative and operational factors could affect the Registrants' success in pursuing their strategies.  Exelon continues to assess infrastructure, operational, commercial, policy, and legal solutions to these issues.  One key issue is ensuring the ability to properly value nuclear generation assets in the market, solutions to which Exelon is actively pursuing in a variety of jurisdictions and venues.  See

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

for additional information regarding market and financial factors.

Exelon continues to be committed to managing its costs. In November 2017, Exelon announced a commitment for

$250 million

of cost savings, primarily at Generation, to be achieved by 2020. In November 2018, Exelon announced the elimination of an approximately additional

$200 million

of annual ongoing costs, through initiatives primarily at Generation and BSC, by 2021. Approximately

$150 million

is expected to be related to Generation, with the remaining amount related to the Utility Registrants. In October 2019, Exelon announced additional annual cost savings of approximately

$100 million

, at Generation, to be achieved by 2022. These actions  are in response to the continuing economic challenges confronting Generation's business, necessitating continued focus on cost management through enhanced efficiency and productivity.

Growth Opportunities

Management continually evaluates growth opportunities aligned with Exelon’s businesses, assets and markets, leveraging Exelon’s expertise in those areas and offering sustainable returns.

Regulated Energy Businesses.

The Utility Registrants anticipate investing approximately

$26 billion

over the next four years in electric and natural gas infrastructure improvements and modernization projects, including smart grid technology, storm hardening, advanced reliability technologies, and transmission projects, which is projected to result in an increase to current rate base of approximately

$13 billion

by the end of 2023. The Utility Registrants invest in rate base where beneficial to customers and the community by increasing reliability and the service experience or otherwise meeting customer needs.  These investments are made at the lowest reasonable cost to customers.

Power Markets

Price of Fuels

The use of new technologies to recover natural gas from shale deposits is increasing natural gas supply and reserves, which places downward pressure on natural gas prices and, therefore, on wholesale and retail power prices, which results in a reduction in Exelon’s revenues. Forward natural gas prices have declined significantly over the last several years; in part reflecting an increase in supply due to strong natural gas production (due to shale gas development).

FERC Inquiry on Resiliency

On August 23, 2017, the DOE staff released its report on the reliability of the electric grid. One aspect of the wide-ranging report is the DOE’s recognition that the electricity markets do not currently value the resiliency provided by base-load generation, such as nuclear plants. On September 28, 2017, the DOE issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) that would entitle certain eligible resilient generating units (i.e., those located in organized markets, with a 90-day supply of fuel on site, not already subject to state cost of service regulation and satisfying certain other requirements) to recover fully allocated costs and earn a fair return on equity on their investment. On January 8, 2018, FERC issued an order terminating the rulemaking docket that it initiated to address the proposed rule in the DOE NOPR, concluding the proposed rule did not sufficiently demonstrate there is a resiliency issue and that it proposed a remedy that did not appear to be just, reasonable and nondiscriminatory as required under the Federal Power Act. At the same time, FERC initiated a new proceeding to consider resiliency challenges to the bulk power system and evaluate whether additional FERC action to address resiliency would be appropriate. FERC directed each RTO and ISO to respond within 60 days to 24 specific questions about how they assess and mitigate threats to resiliency. Thereafter, interested parties submitted reply comments on May 9, 2018, and a few parties submitted further replies. Exelon has been and will continue to be an active participant in these proceedings but cannot predict the final outcome or its potential financial impact, if any, on Exelon or Generation.

Section 232 Uranium Petition

On January 16, 2018, two Canadian-owned uranium mining companies with operations in the U.S. jointly submitted a petition to the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) seeking relief under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, (the Act) from imports of uranium products, alleging that these imports threaten national security (the Petition). The relief requested would have required U.S. nuclear reactors to purchase at least 25% of their uranium needs from domestic mines for the next 10 years or more. The Act was promulgated by Congress to protect essential national security industries whose survival is threatened by imports. As such, the Act authorizes the Secretary of Commerce (the Secretary) to conduct investigations to evaluate the effects of imports of any item on the national security of the U.S. The Petition alleges that the loss of a viable U.S. uranium mining industry would have a significant detrimental impact on the national, energy, and economic security of the U.S. and the ability of the country to sustain an independent nuclear fuel cycle.

On July 18, 2018, the Secretary announced that the DOC had initiated an investigation in response to the petition. The Secretary submitted a report to President Trump on April 14, 2019 that has not been made public. On July 12, 2019, the President issued a memorandum indicating that he did not agree with the Secretary's finding that uranium imports threaten to impair the national security of the United States, choosing not to impose any trade restrictions at this time.The President found that a fuller analysis of national security considerations with respect to the entire nuclear fuel supply chain is necessary and directed that a United States Nuclear Fuel Working Group (Working Group) be established to develop recommendations for reviving and expanding domestic nuclear fuel production. The Working Group report has not yet been issued and is not expected to be made public. The Working Group is co-chaired by the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy. Exelon will monitor and volunteer to provide information to support the Working Group's efforts. Exelon and Generation cannot currently predict the outcome of the Working Group report and subsequent actions.

Complaint at FERC Seeking to Alter Capacity Market Default Offer Caps

On February 21, 2019, PJM's Independent Market Monitor (IMM) filed a complaint alleging that the number of performance assessment intervals used to calculate the default offer cap for bids to supply capacity in PJM is too high, resulting in an overstated default offer cap that obviates the need for most sellers to seek unit-specific approval of their offers. The IMM claims that this allows for the exercise of market power. The IMM asks FERC to require PJM to reduce the number of performance assessment intervals used to calculate the opportunity costs of a capacity



supplier assuming a capacity obligation. This would, in turn, lower the default offer cap and allow the IMM to review more offers on a unit-specific basis. It is too early to predict the final outcome of this proceeding or its potential financial impact, if any, on Exelon or Generation.

Energy Demand

Modest economic growth partially offset by energy efficiency initiatives is resulting in relatively flat load growth in electricity for the Utility Registrants. ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE are projecting load volumes to increase (decrease) by

(0.3)%

,

(0.7)%

,

(1.2)%

,

(0.4)%

,

(0.5)%

and

(0.4)%

, respectively, in


compared to


.

Retail Competition

Generation’s retail operations compete for customers in a competitive environment, which affect the margins that Generation can earn and the volumes that it is able to serve. Forward natural gas and power prices are expected to remain low and thus we expect retail competitors to stay aggressive in their pursuit of market share, and that wholesale generators (including Generation) will continue to use their retail operations to hedge generation output.

Hedging Strategy

Exelon’s policy to hedge commodity risk on a ratable basis over three-year periods is intended to reduce the financial impact of market price volatility. Generation is exposed to commodity price risk associated with the unhedged portion of its electricity portfolio. Generation enters into non-derivative and derivative contracts, including financially-settled swaps, futures contracts and swap options, and physical options and physical forward contracts, all with credit-approved counterparties, to hedge this anticipated exposure. As of

December 31, 2019

, the percentage of expected generation hedged for the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York and ERCOT reportable segments is

91%

-

94%

and

61%

-

64%

for


and


, respectively. Generation has been and will continue to be proactive in using hedging strategies to mitigate commodity price risk.

Generation procures natural gas through long-term and short-term contracts and spot-market purchases. Nuclear fuel assemblies are obtained predominantly through long-term uranium concentrate supply contracts, contracted conversion services, contracted enrichment services, or a combination thereof, and contracted fuel fabrication services. The supply markets for uranium concentrates and certain nuclear fuel services are subject to price fluctuations and availability restrictions. Approximately

60%

of Generation’s uranium concentrate requirements from


through


are supplied by three suppliers. In the event of non-performance by these or other suppliers, Generation believes that replacement uranium concentrate can be obtained, although at prices that may be unfavorable when compared to the prices under the current supply agreements. Non-performance by these counterparties could have a material adverse impact on Exelon’s and Generation’s results of operations, cash flows and financial positions.

The Utility Registrants mitigate commodity price risk through regulatory mechanisms that allow them to recover procurement costs from retail customers.

Environmental Legislative and Regulatory Developments

Exelon was actively involved in the Obama Administration’s development and implementation of environmental regulations for the electric industry, in pursuit of its business strategy to provide reliable, clean, affordable and innovative energy products. These efforts have most frequently involved air, water and waste controls for fossil-fueled electric generating units, as set forth in the discussion below. These regulations have had a disproportionate adverse impact on coal-fired power plants, requiring significant expenditures of capital and variable operating and maintenance expense, and have resulted in the retirement of older, marginal facilities. Due to its low emission generation portfolio, Generation has not been significantly affected by these regulations, representing a competitive advantage relative to electric generators that are more reliant on fossil fuel plants.

Through the issuance of a series of Executive Orders (EO), President Trump has initiated review of a number of EPA and other regulations issued during the Obama Administration, with the expectation that the Administration will seek repeal or significant revision of these rules. Under these EOs, each executive agency is required to evaluate existing regulations and make recommendations regarding repeal, replacement, or modification.  The



Administration’s actions are intended to result in less stringent compliance requirements under air, water, and waste regulations. The exact nature, extent, and timing of the regulatory changes are unknown, as well as the ultimate impact on Exelon’s and its subsidiaries results of operations and cash flows.

In particular, the Administration has targeted existing EPA regulations for repeal, including notably the Clean Power Plan, as well as revoking many Executive Orders, reports, and guidance issued by the Obama Administration on the topic of climate change or the regulation of greenhouse gases. The Executive Order also disbanded the Interagency Working Group that developed the social cost of carbon used in rulemakings, and withdrew all technical support documents supporting the calculation. Other regulations that have been specifically identified for review are the Clean Water Act rule relating to jurisdictional waters of the U.S., the Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines relating to waste water discharges from coal-fired power plants, and the 2015 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone. The review of final rules could extend over several years as formal notice and comment rulemaking process proceeds.

Air Quality

Mercury and Air Toxics Standard Rule (MATS).

On December 16, 2011, the EPA signed a final rule to reduce emissions of toxic air pollutants from power plants and signed revisions to the NSPS for electric generating units. The final rule, known as MATS, requires coal-fired electric generation plants to achieve high removal rates of mercury, acid gases and other metals, and to make capital investments in pollution control equipment and incur higher operating expenses. Numerous entities challenged MATS in the D.C. Circuit Court, and Exelon intervened in support of the rule. In April 2014, the D.C. Circuit Court issued an opinion upholding MATS in its entirety. On appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court decided in June 2015 that the EPA unreasonably refused to consider costs in determining whether it is appropriate and necessary to regulate hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric utilities, but did not vacate the rule. On April 27, 2017, the D.C. Circuit Court granted EPA’s motion to hold the litigation in abeyance, pending EPA’s review of the MATS rule pursuant to President Trump’s EO discussed above. Notwithstanding the Court’s order to hold the litigation in abeyance, the MATS rule remains in effect. Exelon will continue to participate in the remanded proceedings before the D.C. Circuit Court as an intervenor in support of the rule. On December 28, 2018, the EPA proposed to revoke the "appropriate and necessary" finding underpinning the MATS rule. While the proposal would leave in place the rule, it would leave it vulnerable to future legal challenge. On February 7, 2019, EPA published its Reconsideration of Supplemental Finding and Residual Risk and Technology Review.  After considering public comment, EPA transmitted a final version to the Office of Management and Budget for review prior to publication.

Clean Power Plan.

On April 28, 2017, the D.C. Circuit Court issued orders in separate litigation related to the EPA’s actions under the Clean Power Plan (CPP) to amend Clean Air Act Section 111(d) regulation of existing fossil-fired electric generating units and Section 111(b) regulation of new fossil-fired electric generating units.  In both cases, the Court has determined to hold the litigation in abeyance pending a determination whether the rule should be remanded to the EPA. In June 2019, EPA issued a final rule that repealed the CPP, and finalized the Affordable Clean Energy rule to replace the CPP with less stringent emissions guidelines based on heat rate improvement measures that could be achieved within the fence line of existing power plants. The Affordable Clean Energy rule is currently being litigated.

2015 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).

On April 11, 2017, the D.C. Circuit Court ordered that the consolidated 2015 ozone NAAQS litigation be held in abeyance pending EPA’s further review of the 2015 Rule. On August 23, 2019, the D.C. Circuit Court upheld the stringency of NAAQS, but remanded certain aspects of its secondary standard to EPA for revision.

Primary SO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).

EPA took final action on April 17, 2019 to retain the current primary SO2 standard without revision, leaving the standard established in 2010 in effect.

Climate Change.

Exelon supports comprehensive climate change legislation or regulation, including a cap-and-trade program for GHG emissions, which balances the need to protect consumers, business and the economy with the urgent need to reduce national GHG emissions.  In the absence of Federal legislation, the EPA is moving forward with the regulation of GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act. In addition, there have been recent developments in the international regulation of GHG emissions pursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (“UNFCCC” or “Convention”). See

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

, "Global Climate Change" for additional information.



Water Quality

Section 316(b) requires that the cooling water intake structures at electric power plants reflect the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts and is implemented through state-level NPDES permit programs. All of Generation’s power generation facilities with cooling water systems are subject to the regulations. Facilities without closed-cycle recirculating systems (e.g., cooling towers) are potentially most affected by recent changes to the regulations. For Generation, those facilities are Calvert Cliffs, Clinton, Dresden, Eddystone, Fairless Hills, FitzPatrick, Ginna, Gould Street, Handley, Mystic 7, Nine Mile Point Unit 1, Peach Bottom, Quad Cities, and Salem.  See

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

, "Water Quality" for additional information.

Clean Water Rule

In 2015, the EPA and the US Army Corps of Engineers, finalized the Clean Water Rule that significantly expanded the definition of the Waters of the United States under the Clean Water Act and resulted in increased environmental costs for some projects. On October 22, 2019, the EPA and the US Army Corps of Engineers repealed the 2015 Clean Water Rule and restored the definition of the Waters of the United States that existed prior to this rule. On January 23, 2020, a new final rule was issued by the EPA and the US Army Corps of Engineers to streamline and clarify the definition of Waters of the United States and will be effective sixty days after publication in the Federal Register.  This rule represents final action by these government agencies to narrow the scope of Waters of the United States that are regulated under the federal Clean Water Act.

Solid and Hazardous Waste

In October 2015, the first federal regulation for the disposal of coal combustion residuals (CCR) from power plants became effective. The rule classifies CCR as non-hazardous waste under RCRA. Under the regulation, CCR will continue to be regulated by most states subject to coordination with the federal regulations. Generation has previously recorded accruals consistent with state regulation for its owned coal ash sites, and as such, the regulation is not expected to impact Exelon’s and Generation’s financial results. Generation does not have sufficient information to reasonably assess the potential likelihood or magnitude of any remediation requirements that may be asserted under the new federal regulations for coal ash disposal sites formerly owned by Generation. For these reasons, Generation is unable to predict whether and to what extent it may ultimately be held responsible for remediation and other costs relating to formerly owned coal ash disposal sites under the new regulations.

Other Legislative and Regulatory Developments

Illinois Clean Energy Progress Act

On March 14, 2019, the Clean Energy Progress Act was introduced in the Illinois General Assembly to preserve Illinois’ clean energy choices arising from FEJA and empower the IPA to conduct capacity procurements outside of PJM’s base residual auction process, while utilizing the fixed resource requirement provisions in PJM's tariffs which are still subject to penalties and other obligations under the PJM tariffs. The most significant provisions of the proposed legislation are as follows: (1) it allows the IPA to procure capacity directly from clean energy resources that have previously sold ZECs or RECs, including certain of Generation’s nuclear plants in Illinois, or from new clean energy resources, (2) it establishes a goal of achieving 100% carbon-free power in the ComEd service territory by 2032, and (3) it implements reforms to enhance consumer protections in the state’s competitive retail electricity and natural gas markets, including Generation’s retail customers. Energy legislation has also been proposed by other stakeholders, including renewable resource developers, environmental advocates, and coal-fueled generators. Exelon and Generation will work with legislators and stakeholders and cannot predict the outcome or the potential financial impact, if any, on Exelon or Generation.

Nuclear Powers Act of 2019

On April 12, 2019, the Nuclear Powers America Act of 2019 was introduced to the United States Congress, which expands the current investment tax credit to existing nuclear power plants. The proposed legislation would provide a credit equal to 30% of continued capital investment in certain nuclear energy-related expenditures, including capital expenses and nuclear fuel, starting from tax years 2019 through 2023. Thereafter, the credit rate would be reduced to 26% in 2024, 22% in 2025, and 10% in 2026 and beyond. To qualify for the credit, the plant must be



currently operational and must have applied for an operating license renewal before 2026.  Exelon and Generation are working with legislators and stakeholders and cannot predict the outcome or the potential financial impact, if any, on Exelon or Generation.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements. Management believes that the accounting policies described below require significant judgment in their application, or incorporate estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Additional information of the application of these accounting policies can be found in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Nuclear Decommissioning Asset Retirement Obligations (Exelon and Generation)

Generation’s ARO associated with decommissioning its nuclear units was

$10.5 billion

at

December 31, 2019

. The authoritative guidance requires that Generation estimate its obligation for the future decommissioning of its nuclear generating plants. To estimate that liability, Generation uses an internally-developed, probability-weighted, discounted cash flow model which, on a unit-by-unit basis, considers multiple decommissioning outcome scenarios.

As a result of recent nuclear plant retirements in the industry, nuclear operators and third-party service providers are obtaining more information about costs associated with decommissioning activities. At the same time, regulators are gaining more information about decommissioning activities which could result in changes to existing decommissioning requirements. In addition, as more nuclear plants are retired, it is possible that technological advances will be identified that could create efficiencies and lead to a reduction in decommissioning costs. The availability of NDT funds could impact the timing of the decommissioning activities.  Additionally, certain factors such as changes in regulatory requirements during plant operations or the profitability of a nuclear plant could impact the timing of plant retirements. These factors could result in material changes to Generation’s current estimates as more information becomes available and could change the timing of plant retirements and the probability assigned to the decommissioning outcome scenarios.

The nuclear decommissioning obligation is adjusted on a regular basis due to the passage of time and revisions to the key assumptions for the expected timing and/or estimated amounts of the future undiscounted cash flows required to decommission the nuclear plants, based upon the following methodologies and significant estimates and assumptions:

Decommissioning Cost Studies.

Generation uses unit-by-unit decommissioning cost studies to provide a marketplace assessment of the expected costs (in current year dollars) and timing of decommissioning activities, which are validated by comparison to current decommissioning projects within the industry and other estimates. Decommissioning cost studies are updated, on a rotational basis, for each of Generation’s nuclear units at least every five years, unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates.  As part of the annual cost study update process, Generation evaluates newly assumed costs or substantive changes in previously assumed costs to determine if the cost estimate impacts are sufficiently material to warrant application of the updated estimates to the AROs across the nuclear fleet outside of the normal five-year rotating cost study update cycle.

Cost Escalation Factors.

Generation uses cost escalation factors to escalate the decommissioning costs from the decommissioning cost studies discussed above through the assumed decommissioning period for each of the units. Cost escalation studies, updated on an annual basis, are used to determine escalation factors, and are based on inflation indices for labor, equipment and materials, energy, LLRW disposal and other costs. All of the nuclear AROs are adjusted each year for the updated cost escalation factors.

Probabilistic Cash Flow Models.

Generation’s probabilistic cash flow models include the assignment of probabilities to various scenarios for decommissioning cost levels, decommissioning approaches, and timing of plant shutdown on a unit-by-unit basis. Probabilities assigned to cost levels include an assessment of the likelihood of costs 20% higher (high-cost scenario) or 15% lower (low-cost scenario) than the base cost scenario. The assumed decommissioning scenarios include the following three alternatives: (1) DECON which assumes decommissioning activities begin shortly after the cessation of operation, (2) Shortened SAFSTOR generally has a 30-year delay prior to onset of decommissioning activities, and (3) SAFSTOR which assumes the nuclear facility is placed and



maintained in such condition that the nuclear facility can be safely stored and subsequently decontaminated generally within 60 years after cessation of operations. In each decommissioning scenario, spent fuel is transferred to dry cask storage as soon as possible until DOE acceptance for disposal.

The actual decommissioning approach selected once a nuclear facility is shutdown will be determined by Generation at the time of shutdown and may be influenced by multiple factors including the funding status of the nuclear decommissioning trust fund at the time of shutdown.

The assumed plant shutdown timing scenarios include the following four alternatives: (1) the probability of operating through the original 40-year nuclear license term, (2) the probability of operating through an extended 60-year nuclear license term (regardless of whether such 20-year license extension has been received for each unit), (3)  the probability of a second, 20-year license renewal for some nuclear units, and (4) the probability of early plant retirement for certain sites due to changing market conditions and regulatory environments. The successful operation of nuclear plants in the U.S. beyond the initial 40-year license terms has prompted the NRC to consider regulatory and technical requirements for potential plant operations for an 80-year nuclear operating term.  As power market and regulatory environment developments occur, Generation evaluates and incorporates, as necessary, the impacts of such developments into its nuclear ARO assumptions and estimates.

Generation’s probabilistic cash flow models also include an assessment of the timing of DOE acceptance of SNF for disposal. Generation currently assumes DOE will begin accepting SNF in 2030. The SNF acceptance date assumption is based on management’s estimates of the amount of time required for DOE to select a site location and develop the necessary infrastructure for long-term SNF storage. For additional information regarding the estimated date that DOE will begin accepting SNF, see Note

Discount Rates.

The probability-weighted estimated future cash flows for the various assumed scenarios are discounted using credit-adjusted, risk-free rates (CARFR) applicable to the various businesses in which each of the nuclear units originally operated. Generation initially recognizes an ARO at fair value and subsequently adjusts it for changes to estimated costs, timing of future cash flows and modifications to decommissioning assumptions. The ARO is not required or permitted to be re-measured for changes in the CARFR that occur in isolation. Increases in the ARO as a result of upward revisions in estimated undiscounted cash flows are considered new obligations and are measured using a current CARFR as the increase creates a new cost layer within the ARO.  Any decrease in the estimated undiscounted future cash flows relating to the ARO are treated as a modification of an existing ARO cost layer and, therefore, is measured using the average historical CARFR rates used in creating the initial ARO cost layers. If Generation’s future nominal cash flows associated with the ARO were to be discounted at current prevailing CARFR, the obligation would increase from approximately

$10.5 billion

to approximately

$13.2 billion

.

The following table illustrates the significant impact that changes in the CARFR, when combined with changes in projected amounts and expected timing of cash flows, can have on the valuation of the ARO (dollars in millions):



ARO Sensitivities.

Changes in the assumptions underlying the ARO could materially affect the decommissioning obligation. The impact to the ARO of a change in any one of these assumptions is highly dependent on how the other assumptions may correspondingly change.

The following table illustrates the effects of changing certain ARO assumptions while holding all other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):

__________

(a)

Excludes any sites in which management has committed to a specific decommissioning approach.

(b)

Excludes any retired sites.

Goodwill (Exelon, ComEd and PHI)

As of

December 31, 2019

, Exelon’s

$6.7 billion

carrying amount of goodwill consists of

$2.6 billion

at ComEd,

$4 billion

at PHI and immaterial amounts at Generation and DPL. These entities are required to perform an assessment for possible impairment of their goodwill at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting units below their carrying amount. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (known as a component) and is the level at which goodwill is tested for impairment. ComEd has a single operating segment and reporting unit. PHI’s operating segments and reporting units are Pepco, DPL and ACE.  See Note


—

Segment Information

,

$1.4 billion

and

$0.5 billion

, respectively. See Note


—

Intangible Assets

of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Entities assessing goodwill for impairment have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary. As part of the qualitative assessments, Exelon, ComEd and PHI evaluate, among other things, management's best estimate of projected operating and capital cash flows for their businesses, outcomes of recent regulatory proceedings, changes in certain market conditions, including the discount rate and regulated utility peer EBITDA multiples, and the passing margin from their last quantitative assessments performed.

Application of the goodwill impairment test requires management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of the reporting unit, which management estimates using a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market multiples analysis. Significant assumptions used in these fair value analyses include discount and growth rates, utility sector market performance and transactions, projected operating and capital cash flows for ComEd’s, Pepco's, DPL's and ACE's businesses and the fair value of debt. In applying the second step, if needed, management must estimate the fair value of specific assets and liabilities of the reporting unit.

While the annual assessments indicated no impairments, certain assumptions used in the assessment are highly sensitive to changes. Adverse regulatory actions or changes in significant assumptions could potentially result in future impairments of Exelon’s, ComEd's or PHI’s goodwill, which could be material. Based on the results of the



last annual quantitative goodwill tests performed as of November 1, 2016 and November 1, 2018 for ComEd and PHI, respectively, the estimated fair values of the ComEd, Pepco, DPL and ACE reporting units would have needed to decrease by more than

30%

,

30%

,

20%

and

30%

, respectively, for ComEd and PHI to fail the first step of their respective impairment tests.

Purchase Accounting (Exelon, Generation and PHI)

Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquired business are recorded at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition.  The difference between the purchase price amount and the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill on the balance sheet if the purchase price exceeds the estimated net fair value or as a bargain purchase gain on the income statement if the purchase price is less than the estimated net fair value. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment, often utilizes independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, market prices and asset lives, among other items. The judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability, could significantly impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition, such as through depreciation and amortization expense. The allocation of the purchase price may be modified up to one year after the acquisition date as more information is obtained about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the transaction is determined to be an asset acquisition the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed and no goodwill or bargain purchase gain would be recorded.

Unamortized Energy Contract Assets and Liabilities (Exelon, Generation and PHI)

Unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities represent the remaining unamortized balances of non-derivative energy contracts that Generation has acquired and the electricity contracts Exelon has acquired as part of the PHI merger. The initial amount recorded represents the fair value of the contracts at the time of acquisition. At Exelon and PHI, offsetting regulatory assets or liabilities were also recorded for those energy contract costs that are probable of recovery or refund through customer rates. The unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities and any corresponding regulatory assets or liabilities, respectively, are amortized over the life of the contract in relation to the expected realization of the underlying cash flows.  Amortization of the unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities is recorded through purchased power and fuel expense or operating revenues, depending on the nature of the underlying contract.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets (All Registrants)

All Registrants regularly monitor and evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets and asset groups for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. Indicators of potential impairment may include a deteriorating business climate, including, but not limited to, declines in energy prices, condition of the asset, an asset remaining idle for more than a short period of time, specific regulatory disallowance, advances in technology, plans to dispose of a long-lived asset significantly before the end of its useful life, and financial distress of a third party for assets contracted with them on a long-term basis, among others.

The review of long-lived assets and asset groups for impairment utilizes significant assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows, which require assessments of current and projected market conditions.  For the generation business, forecasting future cash flows requires assumptions regarding forecasted commodity prices for the sale of power and purchases of fuel and the expected operations of assets. A variation in the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the recoverability of an asset or asset group and, thus, could potentially result in material future impairments. An impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the long-lived assets or asset groups are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For the generation business, the lowest level of independent cash flows is determined by the evaluation of several factors, including the geographic dispatch of the generation units and the hedging strategies related to those units as well as the associated intangible assets or



liabilities recorded on the balance sheet.  The cash flows from the generating units are generally evaluated at a regional portfolio level with cash flows generated from the customer supply and risk management activities, including cash flows from related intangible assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. In certain cases, generating assets may be evaluated on an individual basis where those assets are contracted on a long-term basis with a third party and operations are independent of other generating assets (typically contracted renewables). For such assets the financial viability of the third party, including the impact of bankruptcy on the contract, may be a significant assumption in the assessment.

On a quarterly basis, Generation assesses its long-lived assets or asset groups for indicators of impairment. If indicators are present for a long-lived asset or asset group, a comparison of the undiscounted expected future cash flows to the carrying value is performed. When the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates the carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group over its fair value. The fair value of the long-lived asset or asset group is dependent upon a market participant’s view of the exit price of the assets. This includes significant assumptions of the estimated future cash flows generated by the assets and market discount rates. Events and circumstances often do not occur as expected and there will usually be differences between prospective financial information and actual results, and those differences may be material. The determination of fair value is driven by both internal assumptions that include significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) such as revenue and generation forecasts, projected capital, and maintenance expenditures and discount rates, as well as information from various public, financial and industry sources.

Depreciable Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment (All Registrants)

The Registrants have significant investments in electric generation assets and electric and natural gas transmission and distribution assets. These assets are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis, using the group, composite or unitary methods of depreciation. The group approach is typically for groups of similar assets that have approximately the same useful lives and the composite approach is used for heterogeneous assets that have different lives. Under both methods, a reporting entity depreciates the assets over the average life of the assets in the group. The estimation of asset useful lives requires management judgment, supported by formal depreciation studies of historical asset retirement experience. Depreciation studies are generally completed every five years, or more frequently if required by a rate regulator or if an event, regulatory action, or change in retirement patterns indicate an update is necessary.

For the Utility Registrants, depreciation studies generally serve as the basis for amounts allowed in customer rates for recovery of depreciation costs. Generally, the Utility Registrants adjust their depreciation rates for financial reporting purposes concurrent with adjustments to depreciation rates reflected in customer rates, unless the depreciation rates reflected in customer rates do not align with management’s judgment as to an appropriate estimated useful life or have not been updated on a timely basis. Depreciation expense and customer rates for ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE includes an estimate of the future costs of dismantling and removing plant from service upon retirement. See Note


— Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding regulatory liabilities and assets recorded by ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE related to removal costs.

PECO’s removal costs are capitalized to accumulated depreciation when incurred, and recorded to depreciation expense over the life of the new asset constructed consistent with PECO’s regulatory recovery method. Estimates for such removal costs are also evaluated in the periodic depreciation studies.

At Generation, along with depreciation study results, management considers expected future energy market conditions and generation plant operating costs and capital investment requirements in determining the estimated service lives of its generating facilities. See Note

Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits (All Registrants)

Exelon sponsors defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement employee benefit plans for substantially all current employees. The measurement of the plan obligations and costs of providing benefits involves various factors, including the development of valuation assumptions and inputs and accounting policy elections. When developing the required assumptions, Exelon considers historical information as well as future expectations. The measurement of benefit obligations and costs is affected by several assumptions including the discount rate applied to benefit obligations, the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets, the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs, Exelon’s expected level of contributions to the plans, the incidence of participant mortality, the expected remaining service period of plan participants, the level of compensation and rate of compensation increases, employee age, length of service, and the long-term expected investment rate credited to employees of certain plans, among others. The assumptions are updated annually and upon any interim remeasurement of the plan obligations. Exelon amortizes actuarial gains or losses in excess of a corridor of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value (MRV) of plan assets over the expected average remaining service period of plan participants.

Pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets include equity securities, including U.S. and international securities, and fixed income securities, as well as certain alternative investment classes such as real estate, private equity and hedge funds.

Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets.

In determining the EROA, Exelon considers historical economic indicators (including inflation and GDP growth) that impact asset returns, as well as expectation regarding future long-term capital market performance, weighted by Exelon’s target asset class allocations.  Exelon calculates the amount of expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the EROA by the MRV of plan assets at the beginning of the year, taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments to be made during the year. In determining MRV, the authoritative guidance for pensions and postretirement benefits allows the use of either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years. For the majority of pension plan assets, Exelon uses a calculated value that adjusts for 20% of the difference between fair value and expected MRV of plan assets. Use of this calculated value approach enables less volatile expected asset returns to be recognized as a component of pension cost from year to year. For other postretirement benefit plan assets and certain pension plan assets, Exelon uses fair value to calculate the MRV.

Discount Rate.

At

December 31, 2019

and


, the discount rates were determined by developing a spot rate curve based on the yield to maturity of a universe of high-quality non-callable (or callable with make whole provisions) bonds with similar maturities to the related pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The spot rates are used to discount the estimated future benefit distribution amounts under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve. Exelon utilizes an analytical tool developed by its actuaries to determine the discount rates.

Mortality.

The mortality assumption is composed of a base table that represents the current expectation of life expectancy of the population adjusted by an improvement scale that attempts to anticipate future improvements in life expectancy. Exelon’s mortality assumption is supported by an actuarial experience study of Exelon's plan participants and beginning in 2019, utilizes the Society of Actuaries' 2019 base table (Pri-2012) and MP-2019

improvement scale adjusted to a

0.75%

long-term rate reached in 2035.



Sensitivity to Changes in Key Assumptions.

The following tables illustrate the effects of changing certain of the actuarial assumptions discussed above, while holding all other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):

__________

(a)

In general, the discount rate will have a larger impact on the pension and other postretirement benefit cost and obligation as the rate moves closer to 0%. Therefore, the discount rate sensitivities above cannot necessarily be extrapolated for larger increases or decreases in the discount rate. Additionally, Exelon utilizes a liability-driven investment strategy for its pension asset portfolio. The sensitivities shown above do not reflect the offsetting impact that changes in discount rates may have on pension asset returns.

Retirement Benefits

Regulatory Accounting (Exelon and Utility Registrants)

For their regulated electric and gas operations, Exelon and the Utility Registrants reflect the effects of cost-based rate regulation in their financial statements, which is required for entities with regulated operations that meet the following criteria: (1) rates are established or approved by a third-party regulator; (2) rates are designed to recover the entities’ cost of providing services or products; and (3) a reasonable expectation that rates designed to recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers. Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because of their probable future recovery from customers through regulated rates. Regulatory liabilities represent (1) revenue or gains that have been deferred because it is probable such amounts will be returned to customers through future regulated rates; or (2) billings in advance of expenditures for approved regulatory programs. If it is concluded in a future period that a separable portion of operations no longer meets the criteria discussed above, Exelon and the Utility Registrants would be required to eliminate any associated regulatory assets and liabilities and the impact would be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and could be material.

The following table illustrates the gains (losses) that could result from the elimination of regulatory assets and liabilities and charges against OCI (dollars in millions before taxes) related to deferred costs associated with Exelon's pension and other postretirement benefit plans that are recorded as regulatory assets in Exelon's Consolidated Balance Sheets:

___________

(a)

Exelon's charge against OCI (before taxes) consists of up to

$2.3 billion

,

$176 million

,

$176 million

,

$396 million

,

$191 million

and

$86 million

related to ComEd's, BGE's, PHI's, Pepco's, DPL's and ACE's respective portions of the deferred costs associated with Exelon's pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Exelon also has a net regulatory liability of

$(44) million

(before taxes) related to PECO’s portion of the deferred costs associated with Exelon’s other postretirement benefit plans that would result in an increase in OCI if reversed.

Regulatory Matters

of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding regulatory matters, including the regulatory assets and liabilities tables of Exelon and the Utility Registrants.

For each regulatory jurisdiction in which they conduct business, Exelon and the Utility Registrants assess whether the regulatory assets and liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement at each balance sheet date and when regulatory events occur. This assessment includes consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs in each Registrant's jurisdictions, and factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and political environments. If the assessments and estimates made by Exelon and the Utility Registrants for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are ultimately different than actual regulatory outcomes, the impact in their consolidated financial statements could be material.

Refer to the revenue recognition discussion below for additional information on the annual revenue reconciliations associated with ICC-approved electric distribution and energy efficiency formula rates for ComEd, and FERC transmission formula rate tariffs for the Utility Registrants.

Accounting for Derivative Instruments (All Registrants)

The Registrants use derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk related to ongoing business operations. The Registrants’ derivative activities are in accordance with Exelon’s Risk Management Policy (RMP). See Note


—

Derivative Financial Instruments

of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

The Registrants account for derivative financial instruments under the applicable authoritative guidance. Determining whether a contract qualifies as a derivative requires that management exercise significant judgment, including assessing market liquidity as well as determining whether a contract has one or more underlyings and one or more notional quantities. Changes in management’s assessment of contracts and the liquidity of their markets, and changes in authoritative guidance, could result in previously excluded contracts becoming in scope to new authoritative guidance.

All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value, except for certain derivatives that qualify for, and are elected under, NPNS. Derivatives entered into for economic hedging and for proprietary trading purposes are recorded at fair value through earnings. For economic hedges that are not designated for hedge accounting for the Utility Registrants, changes in the fair value each period are generally recorded with a corresponding offsetting regulatory asset or liability given likelihood of recovering the associated costs through customer rates.

Normal Purchases and Normal Sales Exception.

As part of Generation’s energy marketing business, Generation enters into contracts to buy and sell energy to meet the requirements of its customers. These contracts include short-term and long-term commitments to purchase and sell energy and energy-related products in the retail and wholesale markets with the intent and ability to deliver or take delivery. While some of these contracts are considered derivative financial instruments under the authoritative guidance, certain of these qualifying transactions have been designated by Generation as NPNS transactions, which are thus not required to be recorded at fair value, but rather on an accrual basis of accounting. Determining whether a contract qualifies for the NPNS requires judgment on whether the contract will physically deliver and requires that management ensure compliance with all of the associated qualification and documentation requirements. Revenues and expenses on contracts that qualify as NPNS are recognized when the underlying physical transaction is completed. Contracts that qualify for the NPNS are those for which physical delivery is probable, quantities are expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business over a reasonable period of time and the contract is not financially settled on a net basis. The contracts that ComEd has entered into with suppliers as part of ComEd’s energy procurement process, PECO’s full requirement contracts under the PAPUC-approved DSP program, most of PECO’s natural gas supply agreements, all of BGE’s full requirement contracts and natural gas supply agreements that are derivatives and certain Pepco, DPL and ACE full requirement contracts qualify for and are accounted for under the NPNS.

Commodity Contracts.

Identification of a commodity contract as an economic hedge requires Generation to determine that the contract is in accordance with the RMP. Generation reassesses its economic hedges on a regular basis to determine if they continue to be within the guidelines of the RMP.

As a part of the authoritative guidance, the Registrants make estimates and assumptions concerning future commodity prices, load requirements, interest rates, the timing of future transactions and their probable cash flows, the fair value of contracts and the expected changes in the fair value in deciding whether or not to enter into derivative



transactions, and in determining the initial accounting treatment for derivative transactions. Under the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, the Registrants categorize these derivatives under a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.

Derivative contracts are traded in both exchange-based and non-exchange-based markets. Exchange-based derivatives that are valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets are generally categorized in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.

Certain derivatives’ pricing is verified using indicative price quotations available through brokers or over-the-counter, on-line exchanges. The price quotations reflect the average of the bid-ask mid-point from markets that the Registrants believe provide the most liquid market for the commodity. The price quotations are reviewed and corroborated to ensure the prices are observable and representative of an orderly transaction between market participants. The Registrant’s derivatives are traded predominately at liquid trading points. The remaining derivative contracts are valued using models that consider inputs such as contract terms, including maturity, and market parameters, and assumptions of the future prices of energy, interest rates, volatility, credit worthiness and credit spread. For derivatives that trade in liquid markets, such as generic forwards, swaps and options, the model inputs are generally observable. Such instruments are categorized in Level 2.

For derivatives that trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information, the model inputs generally would include both observable and unobservable inputs and are categorized in Level 3.

The Registrants consider nonperformance risk, including credit risk in the valuation of derivative contracts, including both historical and current market data in its assessment of nonperformance risk, including credit risk. The impacts of nonperformance and credit risk to date have generally not been material to the financial statements.

Taxation (All Registrants)

Significant management judgment is required in determining the Registrants’ provisions for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances. The Registrants account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach including a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of tax benefits to be recorded in the Registrants’ consolidated financial statements.

The Registrants evaluate quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and their intent and ability to implement tax planning strategies, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. The Registrants also assess negative evidence, such as the expiration of historical operating loss or tax credit carryforwards, that could indicate the Registrant's inability to realize its deferred tax assets. Based on the combined assessment, the Registrants record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when it is more-likely-than-not such benefit will not be realized in future periods.

Actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including future changes in income tax laws, the Registrants’ forecasted financial condition and results of operations, failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies, as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities.

Accounting for Loss Contingencies (All Registrants)

In the preparation of their financial statements, the Registrants make judgments regarding the future outcome of contingent events and record liabilities for loss contingencies that are probable and can be reasonably estimated based upon available information. The amount recorded may differ from the actual expense incurred when the



uncertainty is resolved. Such difference could have a significant impact in the Registrants' consolidated financial statements.

Environmental Costs.

Environmental investigation and remediation liabilities are based upon estimates with respect to the number of sites for which the Registrants will be responsible, the scope and cost of work to be performed at each site, the portion of costs that will be shared with other parties, the timing of the remediation work and changes in technology, regulations and the requirements of local governmental authorities. Annual studies and/or reviews are conducted at ComEd, PECO, BGE and DPL to determine future remediation requirements for MGP sites and estimates are adjusted accordingly. In addition, periodic reviews are performed at each of the Registrants to assess the adequacy of other environmental reserves.  These matters, if resolved in a manner different from the estimate, could have a significant impact in the Registrants’ consolidated financial statements. See Note

Commitments and Contingencies

of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Other, Including Personal Injury Claims.

The Registrants are self-insured for general liability, automotive liability, workers’ compensation, and personal injury claims to the extent that losses are within policy deductibles or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. The Registrants have reserves for both open claims asserted and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported (IBNR). The IBNR reserve is estimated based on actuarial assumptions and analysis and is updated annually. Future events, such as the number of new claims to be filed each year, the average cost of disposing of claims, as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding litigation and possible state and national legislative measures could cause the actual costs to be higher or lower than estimated. Accordingly, these claims, if resolved in a manner different from the estimate, could have a material impact in the Registrants’ consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition (All Registrants)

Sources of Revenue and Determination of Accounting Treatment.

The Registrants earn revenues from various business activities including: the sale of power and energy-related products, such as natural gas, capacity, and other commodities in non-regulated markets (wholesale and retail); the sale and delivery of power and natural gas in regulated markets; and the provision of other energy-related non-regulated products and services.

The accounting treatment for revenue recognition is based on the nature of the underlying transaction and applicable authoritative guidance. The Registrants primarily apply the Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Derivative and Alternative Revenue Program (ARP) guidance to recognize revenue as discussed in more detail below.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

The Registrants recognize revenues in the period in which the performance obligations within contracts with customers are satisfied, which generally occurs when power, natural gas, and other energy-related commodities are physically delivered to the customer. Transactions of the Registrants within the scope of Revenue from Contracts with Customers generally include non-derivative agreements, contracts that are designated as NPNS, sales to utility customers under regulated service tariffs, and spot-market energy commodity sales, including settlements with independent system operators.

The determination of Generation’s and the Utility Registrants' retail power and natural gas sales to individual customers is based on systematic readings of customer meters, generally on a monthly basis. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated, and corresponding unbilled revenue is recorded. The measurement of unbilled revenue is affected by the following factors: daily customer usage measured by generation or gas throughput volume, customer usage by class, losses of energy during delivery to customers and applicable customer rates. Increases or decreases in volumes delivered to the utilities’ customers and favorable or unfavorable rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue. In addition, revenues may fluctuate monthly as a result of customers electing to use an alternate supplier, since unbilled commodity revenues are not recorded for these customers. Changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date also impact the measurement of unbilled revenue; however, total operating revenues would remain materially unchanged.

Significant Accounting Policies

of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Derivative Revenues.

The Registrants record revenues and expenses using the mark-to-market method of accounting for transactions that are accounted for as derivatives. These derivative transactions primarily relate to commodity price risk management activities. Mark-to-market revenues and expenses include: inception gains or



losses on new transactions where the fair value is observable, unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of open contracts, and realized gains and losses.

Alternative Revenue Program Accounting.

Certain of the Utility Registrants’ ratemaking mechanisms qualify as ARPs if they (i) are established by a regulatory order and allow for automatic adjustment to future rates, (ii) provide for additional revenues (above those amounts currently reflected in the price of utility service) that are objectively determinable and probable of recovery, and (iii) allow for the collection of those additional revenues within 24 months following the end of the period in which they were recognized. For mechanisms that meet these criteria, which include the Utility Registrants’ formula rate and revenue decoupling mechanisms, the Utility Registrants adjust revenue and record an offsetting regulatory asset or liability once the condition or event allowing additional billing or refund has occurred. The ARP revenues presented in the Utility Registrants’ Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income include both: (i) the recognition of “originating” ARP revenues (when the regulator-specified condition or event allowing for additional billing or refund has occurred) and (ii) an equal and offsetting reversal of the “originating” ARP revenues as those amounts are reflected in the price of utility service and recognized as Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

ComEd records ARP revenue for its best estimate of the electric distribution, energy efficiency, and transmission revenue impacts resulting from future changes in rates that ComEd believes are probable of approval by the ICC and FERC in accordance with its formula rate mechanisms. BGE, Pepco and DPL record ARP revenue for their best estimate of the electric and natural gas distribution revenue impacts resulting from future changes in rates that they believe are probable of approval by the MDPSC and/or DCPSC in accordance with their revenue decoupling mechanisms. PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE record ARP revenue for their best estimate of the transmission revenue impacts resulting from future changes in rates that they believe are probable of approval by FERC in accordance with their formula rate mechanisms. Estimates of the current year revenue requirement are based on actual and/or forecasted costs and investments in rate base for the period and the rates of return on common equity and associated regulatory capital structure allowed under the applicable tariff. The estimated reconciliation can be affected by, among other things, variances in costs incurred, investments made, allowed ROE, and actions by regulators or courts.

Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts (Utility Registrants)

Utility Registrants estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts on customer receivables by applying loss rates developed specifically for each company to the outstanding receivable balance by customer risk segment. Risk segments represent a group of customers with similar credit quality indicators that are comprised based on various attributes, including delinquency of their balances and payment history. Loss rates applied to the accounts receivable balances are based on a historical average of charge-offs as a percentage of accounts receivable in each risk segment. The Utility Registrants' customer accounts are generally considered delinquent if the amount billed is not received by the time the next bill is issued, which normally occurs on a monthly basis. Utility Registrants' customer accounts are written off consistent with approved regulatory requirements. Utility Registrants' allowances for uncollectible accounts will continue to be affected by changes in volume, prices and economic conditions as well as changes in ICC, PAPUC, MDPSC, DCPSC, DPSC and NJBPU regulations.

Results of Operations by Registrant

The Registrants' Results of Operations includes discussion of RNF, which is a financial measure not defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. The CODMs for Exelon and Generation evaluate the performance of Generation's electric business activities and allocate resources based on RNF. Generation believes that RNF is a useful measure because it provides information that can be used to evaluate its operational performance. For the Utility Registrants, their Operating revenues reflect the full and current recovery of commodity procurement costs given the rider mechanisms approved by their respective state regulators. The commodity procurement costs, which are recorded in Purchased power and fuel expense, and the associated revenues can be volatile. Therefore, the Utility Registrants believe that RNF is a useful measure because it excludes the effect on Operating revenues caused by the volatility in these expenses.

Revenues Net of Purchased Power and Fuel Expense.

The basis for Generation's reportable segments is the integrated management of its electricity business that is located in different geographic regions, and largely representative of the footprints of ISO/RTO and/or NERC regions, which utilize multiple supply sources to provide electricity through various distribution channels (wholesale and retail). Generation's hedging strategies and risk metrics are also aligned with these same geographic regions. Generation's five reportable segments are Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York, ERCOT and Other Power Regions. During the first quarter of 2019, due to a change in economics in our New England region, Generation changed the way that information is reviewed by the CODM. The New England region will no longer be regularly reviewed as a separate region by the CODM nor will it be presented separately in any external information presented to third parties. Information for the New England region will be reviewed by the CODM as part of Other Power Regions. See Note

.

Net income

increased by

$24 million

primarily due to higher electric distribution, transmission and energy efficiency formula rate earnings (reflecting the impacts of higher rate base, partially offset by lower allowed electric distribution ROE due to a decrease in treasury rates).

Revenues Net of Purchased Power Expense.

There are certain drivers of Operating revenues that are fully offset by their impact on Purchased power expense, such as commodity, REC and ZEC procurement costs and participation in customer choice programs. ComEd recovers electricity, REC and ZEC procurement costs from customers without mark-up. Therefore, fluctuations in these costs have no impact on RNF.

Customers have the choice to purchase electricity from a competitive electric generation supplier. Customer choice programs do not impact the volume of deliveries, but do impact Operating revenues related to supplied electricity.

The changes in

RNF

consisted of the following:



ComEd

Revenue Decoupling.

The demand for electricity is affected by weather and customer usage. Operating revenues are not impacted by abnormal weather, usage per customer or number of customers as a result of a change to the electric distribution formula rate pursuant to FEJA.

Distribution Revenue.

EIMA and FEJA provide for a performance-based formula rate, which requires an annual reconciliation of the revenue requirement in effect to the actual costs that the ICC determines are prudently and reasonably incurred in a given year. Electric distribution revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs (e.g., severe weather and storm restoration), investments being recovered and allowed ROE. During the year ended

December 31, 2019

, as compared to the same period in


, electric distribution revenue increased primarily due to the impact of higher rate base and increased depreciation expenses, offset by lower allowed ROE due to a decrease in treasury rates.  See Operating and Maintenance Expense below and Note

Transmission Revenue.

Under a FERC-approved formula, transmission revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, capital investments being recovered and the highest daily peak load, which is updated annually in January based on the prior calendar year. Generally, increases/decreases in the highest daily peak load will result in higher/lower transmission revenue. During the year ended

December 31, 2019

, as compared to the same period in


, transmission revenue increased primarily due to the impact of increased peak load, higher rate base, and higher fully recoverable costs. See Operating and Maintenance Expense below and Note

increased by $68 million primarily due to higher electric distribution rates that became effective January 2019, higher natural gas distribution rates and lower storm costs, partially offset by unfavorable weather conditions and volume.

Revenues Net of Purchased Power and Fuel Expense.

There are certain drivers of Operating revenues that are fully offset by their impact on Purchased power and fuel expenses such as commodity and REC procurement costs and participation in customer choice programs.  PECO's recovers electricity, natural gas and REC procurement costs from customers without mark-up.  Therefore, fluctuations in these costs have no impact on RNF.

Customers have the choice to purchase electricity and natural gas from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers.  Customer choice programs do not impact the volume of deliveries or RNF, but impact Operating revenues related to supplied electricity and natural gas.

The changes in

RNF

consisted of the following:



PECO

Weather.

The demand for electricity and natural gas is affected by weather conditions. With respect to the electric business, very warm weather in summer months and, with respect to the electric and natural gas businesses, very cold weather in winter months are referred to as “favorable weather conditions” because these weather conditions result in increased deliveries of electricity and natural gas. Conversely, mild weather reduces demand.  For the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to the same period in


RNF was decreased by the impact of unfavorable weather conditions in PECO's service territory.

Heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect the demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business. Normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree days for a 30-year period in PECO’s service territory.

Compared to Year Ended

December 31, 2018

.

Net income

increased by

$38 million

primarily due to higher electric distribution rates in Maryland that became effective August 2019 and June 2018 (not reflecting the impact of TCJA), higher electric distribution rates in the District of Columbia that became effective August 2018 (not reflecting the impact of TCJA), higher transmission revenues due to an increase in transmission rates and the highest daily peak load, the absence of the charge associated with a remeasurement of the Buzzard Point ARO, and lower contracting costs, partially offset by an increase in environmental liabilities.

Revenues Net of Purchased Power Expense.

There are certain drivers of

Operating revenues that are fully offset by their impact on Purchased power expense, such as commodity and REC procurement costs and participation in customer choice programs. Pepco recovers electricity and REC procurement costs from customers with a slight mark-up. Therefore, fluctuations in these costs have minimal impact on RNF.

Customers have the choice to purchase electricity from competitive electric generation suppliers. Customer choice programs do not impact the volume of deliveries or RNF, but impact Operating revenues related to supplied electricity.



Pepco

The changes in

RNF

consisted of the following:

Revenue Decoupling.

The demand for electricity is affected by weather and customer usage. However, Operating revenues from electric distribution in both Maryland and the District of Columbia are not impacted by abnormal weather or usage per customer as a result of a bill stabilization adjustment (BSA) that provides for a fixed distribution charge per customer by customer class. While Operating revenues are not impacted by abnormal weather or usage per customer, they are impacted by changes in the number of customers.

Regulatory Matters

of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Regulatory Required Programs

represent revenues collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for regulatory programs such as energy efficiency programs, DC PLUG and SOS administrative costs. The riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery as well as a return in certain instances. The costs of these programs are included in Operating and maintenance expense, Depreciation and amortization expense, and Taxes other than income taxes.

Revenues from regulatory programs decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 due to lower surcharge rates effective January 2019 for energy efficiency programs that were implemented to reflect the impacts of the enactment of TCJA.

Transmission Revenues.

Under a FERC approved formula, transmission revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, capital investments being recovered and the highest daily peak load, which is updated annually in January based on the prior calendar year. Generally, increases/decreases in the highest daily peak load will result in higher/lower transmission revenue. Transmission revenue increased for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to the same period in


due to rate increases and an increase in the highest daily peak load.

Net income

increased by

$27 million

primarily due to higher transmission revenues due to an increase in the transmission rates and the highest daily peak load, higher electric distribution rates in Maryland and Delaware that became effective throughout 2018 (not reflecting the impact of TCJA), higher natural gas distribution rates in Delaware that became effective throughout 2018 (not reflecting the impact of TCJA), and lower write-offs of construction work in progress.

Revenues Net of Purchased Power and Fuel Expense.

There are certain drivers to Operating revenues that are fully offset by their impact on Purchased power and fuel expense, such as commodity and REC procurement costs and participation in customer choice programs. DPL recovers electricity and REC procurement costs from customers with a slight mark-up and natural gas costs from customers without mark-up. Therefore, fluctuations in these costs have minimal impact on RNF.

Customers have the choice to purchase electricity from competitive electric generation suppliers. Customer choice programs do not impact the volume of deliveries or RNF, but impact Operating revenues related to supplied electricity.

The changes in

RNF

consisted of the following:

Revenue Decoupling.

The demand for electricity is affected by weather and customer usage. However, Operating revenues from electric distribution customers in Maryland are not affected by unseasonably warmer or colder weather because a bill stabilization adjustment (BSA) that provides for a fixed distribution charge per customer by customer class. While Operating revenues from electric distribution customers in Maryland are not impacted by abnormal weather or usage per customer, they are impacted by changes in the number of customers.

Weather.

The demand for electricity and natural gas in Delaware is affected by weather conditions. With respect to the electric business, very warm weather in summer months and, with respect to the electric and natural gas businesses, very cold weather in winter months are referred to as "favorable weather conditions” because these weather conditions result in increased deliveries of electricity and natural gas. Conversely, mild weather reduces demand. During the year ended

December 31, 2019

Liquidity and Capital Resources

All results included throughout the liquidity and capital resources section are presented on a GAAP basis.

The Registrants’ operating and capital expenditures requirements are provided by internally generated cash flows from operations as well as funds from external sources in the capital markets and through bank borrowings. The Registrants’ businesses are capital intensive and require considerable capital resources. Each of the Registrants annually evaluates its financing plan, dividend practices and credit line sizing, focusing on maintaining its investment grade ratings while meeting its cash needs to fund capital requirements, retire debt, pay dividends, fund pension and OPEB obligations and invest in new and existing ventures.  A broad spectrum of financing alternatives beyond the core financing options can be used to meet its needs and fund growth including monetizing assets in the portfolio via project financing, asset sales, and the use of other financing structures (e.g., joint ventures, minority partners, etc.). Each Registrant’s access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on its credit ratings and current overall capital market business conditions, including that of the utility industry in general. If these conditions deteriorate to the extent that the Registrants no longer have access to the capital markets at reasonable terms, the



Registrants have access to credit facilities with aggregate bank commitments of

$10.6 billion

. The Registrants utilize their credit facilities to support their commercial paper programs, provide for other short-term borrowings and to issue letters of credit. See the “Credit Matters” section below for additional information. The Registrants expect cash flows to be sufficient to meet operating expenses, financing costs and capital expenditure requirements.

The Registrants primarily use their capital resources, including cash, to fund capital requirements, including construction expenditures, retire debt, pay dividends, fund pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and invest in new and existing ventures. The Registrants spend a significant amount of cash on capital improvements and construction projects that have a long-term return on investment. Additionally, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE operate in rate-regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be delayed or limited and where such recovery takes place over an extended period of time. See Note

Debt and Credit Agreements

of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information of the Registrants’ debt and credit agreements.

NRC Minimum Funding Requirements

NRC regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that sufficient funds will be available in certain minimum amounts to decommission the facility. These NRC minimum funding levels are based upon the assumption that decommissioning activities will commence after the end of the current licensed life of each unit. If a unit fails the NRC minimum funding test, then the plant’s owners or parent companies would be required to take steps, such as providing financial guarantees through letters of credit or parent company guarantees or making additional cash contributions to the NDT fund to ensure sufficient funds are available.  See Note


-

Asset Retirement Obligations

of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

If a nuclear plant were to early retire there is a risk that it will no longer meet the NRC minimum funding requirements due to the earlier commencement of decommissioning activities and a shorter time period over which the NDT fund investments could appreciate in value. A shortfall could require that Generation address the shortfall by, among other things, obtaining a parental guarantee for Generation’s share of the funding assurance. However, the amount of any guarantees or other assurance will ultimately depend on the decommissioning approach, the associated level of costs, and the NDT fund investment performance going forward.

Upon issuance of any required financial guarantees, each site would be able to utilize the respective NDT funds for radiological decommissioning costs, which represent the majority of the total expected decommissioning costs. However, the NRC must approve an exemption in order for the plant’s owner(s) to utilize the NDT fund to pay for non-radiological decommissioning costs (i.e., spent fuel management and site restoration costs). If a unit does not receive this exemption, the costs would be borne by the owner(s) without reimbursement from or access to the NDT funds. The ultimate costs for spent fuel management may vary greatly and could be reduced by alternate decommissioning scenarios and/or reimbursement of certain costs under the DOE reimbursement agreements.

As of

December 31, 2019

, Exelon would not be required to post a parental guarantee for TMI Unit 1 under the SAFSTOR scenario which is the planned decommissioning option as described in the TMI Unit 1 PSDAR filed by Generation with the NRC on April 5, 2019. On October 16, 2019, the NRC granted Generation's exemption request to use the TMI Unit 1 NDT funds for spent fuel management costs. An additional exemption request would be required to allow the funds to be spent on site restoration costs, which are not expected to be incurred in the near term.

Project Financing (Exelon and Generation)

Project financing is used to help mitigate risk of specific generating assets. Project financing is based upon a nonrecourse financial structure, in which project debt is paid back from the cash generated by the specific asset or portfolio of assets. Borrowings under these agreements are secured by the assets and equity of each respective project. The lenders do not have recourse against Exelon or Generation in the event of a default.  If a specific project financing entity does not maintain compliance with its specific debt financing covenants, there could be a requirement to accelerate repayment of the associated debt or other project-related borrowings earlier than the stated maturity dates. In these instances, if such repayment was not satisfied, or restructured, the lenders or security holders would generally have rights to foreclose against the project-specific assets and related collateral. The potential requirement to satisfy its associated debt or other borrowings earlier than otherwise anticipated could lead to impairments due to a higher likelihood of disposing of the respective project-specific assets significantly before the end of their useful



lives.  Additionally, project finance has credit facilities. See Note

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

General

Generation’s cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the sale of electric energy and energy-related products and services to customers. Generation’s future cash flows from operating activities may be affected by future demand for and market prices of energy and its ability to continue to produce and supply power at competitive costs as well as to obtain collections from customers.

The Utility Registrants' cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the transmission and distribution of electricity and, in the case of PECO, BGE and DPL, gas distribution services. The Utility Registrants' distribution services are provided to an established and diverse base of retail customers. The Utility Registrants' future cash flows may be affected by the economy, weather conditions, future legislative initiatives, future regulatory proceedings with respect to their rates or operations, competitive suppliers, and their ability to achieve operating cost reductions.

Depending upon whether Generation is in a net mark-to-market liability or asset position,

collateral

may be required to be posted with or collected from its counterparties.  In addition, the collateral posting and collection requirements differ depending on whether the transactions are on an exchange or in the OTC markets.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Management considers various factors when making pension funding decisions, including actuarially determined minimum contribution requirements under ERISA, contributions required to avoid benefit restrictions and at-risk status as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Act), management of the pension obligation and regulatory implications. The Act requires the attainment of certain funding levels to avoid benefit restrictions (such as an inability to pay lump sums or to accrue benefits prospectively), and at-risk status (which triggers higher minimum contribution requirements and participant notification).  The projected contributions below reflect a funding strategy to make levelized annual contributions with the objective of achieving 100% funded status on an Accumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO) basis over time. This level funding strategy helps minimize volatility of future period required pension contributions. Based on this funding strategy and current market conditions, which are subject to change, Exelon’s estimated annual qualified pension contributions will be approximately

$


million

beginning in 2020. Unlike the qualified pension plans, Exelon’s non-qualified pension plans are not funded, given that they are not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements.

While other postretirement plans are also not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements, Exelon does fund certain of its plans.  For Exelon's funded OPEB plans, contributions generally equal accounting costs, however, Exelon’s management has historically considered several factors in determining the level of contributions to its OPEB plans, including liabilities management, levels of benefit claims paid and regulatory implications (amounts deemed prudent to meet regulatory expectations and best assure continued rate recovery).  The amounts below include benefit payments related to unfunded plans.

The following table provides all registrants' planned contributions to the qualified pension plans, planned benefit payments to non-qualified pension plans, and planned contributions to other postretirement plans in 2020:

To the extent interest rates decline significantly or the pension and OPEB plans earn less than the expected asset returns, annual pension contribution requirements in future years could increase.  Conversely, to the extent interest rates increase significantly or the pension and OPEB plans earn greater than the expected asset returns, annual pension and OPEB contribution requirements in future years could decrease.  Additionally, expected contributions could change if Exelon changes its pension or OPEB funding strategy.

and


were as follows:

•

Variances in

capital expenditures

are primarily due to the timing of cash expenditures for capital projects. Refer below for additional information on projected capital expenditure spending.

•

During 2018, Exelon and Generation had expenditures of $81 million and $57 related to the

acquisitions

of the Everett Marine Terminal and the Handley generating station.

•

During 2017, Exelon and Generation had expenditures of $23 million and $178 million related to the

acquisitions

of ConEdison Solutions and the FitzPatrick nuclear generating station.

•

During 2018, Exelon and Generation had proceeds of $85 million relating to the

sale

of Generation’s interest in an electrical contracting business that primarily installs, maintains and repairs underground and high-voltage cable transmission and distribution services.

Capital Expenditure Spending

The Registrants most recent estimates of capital expenditures for plant additions and improvements for


are as follows:

Projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors.

Generation

Approximately

45%

of projected


capital expenditures at Generation are for the acquisition of nuclear fuel, with the remaining amounts reflecting additions and upgrades to existing generation facilities (including material condition improvements during nuclear refueling outages), and additional investment in new generation facilities.  Generation anticipates that it will fund capital expenditures with internally generated funds and borrowings.

Utility Registrants

Projected


capital expenditures at the Utility Registrants are for continuing projects to maintain and improve operations, including enhancing reliability and adding capacity to the transmission and distribution systems such as the Utility Registrants' construction commitments under PJM’s RTEP.

The Utility Registrants as transmission owners are subject to NERC compliance requirements. NERC provides guidance to transmission owners regarding assessments of transmission lines. The results of these assessments could require the Utility Registrants to incur incremental capital or operating and maintenance expenditures to ensure their transmission lines meet NERC standards. In 2010, NERC provided guidance to transmission owners that recommended the Utility Registrants perform assessments of their transmission lines. ComEd, PECO and BGE submitted their final bi-annual reports to NERC in January 2014.  ComEd and PECO will be incurring incremental capital expenditures associated with this guidance following the completion of the assessments. Specific projects and expenditures are identified as the assessments are completed. ComEd’s and PECO’s forecasted


capital expenditures above reflect capital spending for remediation to be completed through


.  BGE, DPL and ACE are complete with their assessments and Pepco has substantially completed its assessment and thus do not expect significant capital expenditures related to this guidance in


.

The Utility Registrants anticipate that they will fund their capital expenditures with a combination of internally generated funds and borrowings and additional capital contributions from parent.

Credit Matters

Market Conditions

The Registrants fund liquidity needs for capital investment, working capital, energy hedging and other financial commitments through cash flows from continuing operations, public debt offerings, commercial paper markets and large, diversified credit facilities. The credit facilities include

$10.6 billion

in aggregate total commitments of which

$7.4 billion

was available to support additional commercial paper as of

December 31, 2019

, and of which no financial institution has more than

7%

of the aggregate commitments for the Registrants. The Registrants had access to the commercial paper market during


to fund their short-term liquidity needs, when necessary. The Registrants routinely review the sufficiency of their liquidity position, including appropriate sizing of credit facility commitments, by performing various stress test scenarios, such as commodity price movements, increases in margin-related transactions, changes in hedging levels and the impacts of hypothetical credit downgrades. The Registrants have continued to closely monitor events in the financial markets and the financial institutions associated with the credit facilities, including monitoring credit ratings and outlooks, credit default swap levels, capital raising and merger activity. See PART I.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

for additional information regarding the effects of uncertainty in the capital and credit markets.

The Registrants believe their cash flow from operating activities, access to credit markets and their credit facilities provide sufficient liquidity. If Generation lost its investment grade credit rating as of

December 31, 2019

, it would have been required to provide incremental collateral of

$1.5 billion

to meet collateral obligations for derivatives, non-derivatives, normal purchases and normal sales contracts and applicable payables and receivables, net of the contractual right of offset under master netting agreements, which is well within the

$4.2 billion

of available credit capacity of its revolver.



The following table presents the incremental collateral that each Utility Registrant would have been required to provide in the event each Utility Registrant lost its investment grade credit rating at

December 31, 2019

and available credit facility capacity prior to any incremental collateral at

December 31, 2019

:

__________

(a)

Represents incremental collateral related to natural gas procurement contracts.

Exelon Credit Facilities

Exelon Corporate, ComEd and BGE meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper.  Generation and PECO meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings from the Exelon intercompany money pool.  Pepco, DPL, and ACE meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings from the PHI intercompany money pool. P

HI Corporate meets its short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of short-term notes and the Exelon intercompany money pool.

The Registrants may use their respective credit facilities for general corporate purposes, including meeting short-term funding requirements and the issuance of letters of credit.

Capital Structure.

At

December 31, 2019

, the capital structures of the Registrants consisted of the following:

__________

(a)

Includes approximately

$


million

,

$


million

and

$


million

owed to unconsolidated affiliates of Exelon, ComEd, and PECO respectively. These special purpose entities were created for the sole purposes of issuing mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities of ComEd and PECO. See Note

Variable Interest Entities

of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the authoritative guidance for VIEs.

Security Ratings

The Registrants’ access to the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and their respective financing costs in those markets, may depend on the securities ratings of the entity that is accessing the capital markets.

The Registrants’ borrowings are not subject to default or prepayment as a result of a downgrading of securities, although such a downgrading of a Registrant’s securities could increase fees and interest charges under that Registrant’s credit agreements.



As part of the normal course of business, the Registrants enter into contracts that contain express provisions or otherwise permit the Registrants and their counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable contracts law, if the Registrants are downgraded by a credit rating agency, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance, which could include the posting of collateral. See Note


—

Derivative Financial Instruments

of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on collateral provisions.

Intercompany Money Pool

To provide an additional short-term borrowing option that will generally be more favorable to the borrowing participants than the cost of external financing, both Exelon and PHI operate an intercompany money pool. Maximum amounts contributed to and borrowed from the money pool by participant and the net contribution or borrowing as of

December 31, 2019

, are presented in the following tables:



Shelf Registration Statements.

Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE have a currently effective combined shelf registration statement unlimited in amount, filed with the SEC, that will expire in August 2022. The ability of each Registrant to sell securities off the shelf registration statement or to access the private placement markets will depend on a number of factors at the time of the proposed sale, including other required regulatory approvals, as applicable, the current financial condition of the Registrant, its securities ratings and market conditions.

Regulatory Authorizations.

ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE are required to obtain short-term and long-term financing authority from Federal and State Commissions as follows:

__________

(a)

Generation currently has blanket financing authority it received from FERC in connection with its market-based rate authority.

(b)

On October 15, 2019, ComEd, BGE, Pepco and DPL filed applications with FERC and on September 12, 2019, ACE filed an application with NJBPU for renewal of their short-term financing authority through December 31, 2021. ComEd, BGE, Pepco and DPL received approval on December 13, 2019 and ACE received approval on December 6, 2019.

(c)

As of

December 31, 2019

, ComEd had

$393 million

See

Note 18 — Commitments and Contingencies

and

Note 3 — Regulatory Matters

of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information of the Registrants’ other commitments potentially triggered by future events. Additionally, see below for where to find additional information regarding certain contractual obligations in the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements:

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Registrants are exposed to market risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, counterparty credit, interest rates and equity prices. Exelon’s RMC approves risk management policies and objectives for risk assessment, control and valuation, counterparty credit approval, and the monitoring and reporting of risk exposures. The RMC is chaired by the chief executive officer and includes the chief risk officer, chief strategy officer, chief executive officer of Exelon Utilities, chief commercial officer, chief financial officer and chief executive officer of Constellation. The RMC reports to the Finance and Risk Committee of the Exelon Board of Directors on the scope of the risk management activities.

Commodity Price Risk (All Registrants)

Commodity price risk is associated with price movements resulting from changes in supply and demand, fuel costs, market liquidity, weather conditions, governmental regulatory and environmental policies and other factors. To the extent the total amount of energy Exelon generates and purchases differs from the amount of energy it has contracted

to sell, Exelon is exposed to market fluctuations in commodity prices.  Exelon seeks to mitigate its commodity price risk through the sale and purchase of electricity, fossil fuel and other commodities.

Generation

Electricity available from Generation’s owned or contracted generation supply in excess of Generation’s obligations to customers, including portions of the Utility Registrants' retail load, is sold into the wholesale markets. To reduce commodity price risk caused by market fluctuations, Generation enters into non-derivative contracts as well as derivative contracts, including swaps, futures, forwards and  options, with approved counterparties to hedge anticipated exposures. Generation uses derivative instruments as economic hedges to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. Generation expects the settlement of the majority of its economic hedges will occur during


through


.

In general, increases and decreases in forward market prices have a positive and negative impact, respectively, on Generation’s owned and contracted generation positions which have not been hedged. Exelon's hedging program involves the hedging of commodity price risk for Exelon's expected generation, typically on a ratable basis over three-year periods. As of

December 31, 2019

, the percentage of expected generation hedged for the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York and ERCOT reportable segments is

91%

-

94%

and

61%

-

64%

for


and


, respectively.   The percentage of expected generation hedged is the amount of equivalent sales divided by the expected generation.  Expected generation is the volume of energy that best represents our commodity position in energy markets from owned or contracted generation based upon a simulated dispatch model that makes assumptions regarding future market conditions, which are calibrated to market quotes for power, fuel, load following products and options.  Equivalent sales represent all hedging products, which include economic hedges and certain non-derivative contracts, including Generation’s sales to ComEd, PECO and BGE to serve their retail load.

A portion of Generation’s hedging strategy may be accomplished with fuel products based on assumed correlations between power and fuel prices, which routinely change in the market. Market price risk exposure is the risk of a change in the value of unhedged positions. The forecasted market price risk exposure for Generation’s entire economic hedge portfolio associated with a

$5

reduction in the annual average around-the-clock energy price based on

December 31, 2019

market conditions and hedged position would be decreases in pre-tax net income of approximately

$25 million

and

$331 million

, respectively, for


and


. Power price sensitivities are derived by adjusting power price assumptions while keeping all other price inputs constant. Generation actively manages its portfolio to mitigate market price risk exposure for its unhedged position. Actual results could differ depending on the specific timing of, and markets affected by, price changes, as well as future changes in Generation’s portfolio.  See Note

Derivative Financial Instruments

of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Fuel Procurement

Generation procures natural gas through long-term and short-term contracts, and spot-market purchases. Nuclear fuel assemblies are obtained predominantly through long-term uranium concentrate supply contracts, contracted conversion services, contracted enrichment services, or a combination thereof, and contracted fuel fabrication services. The supply markets for uranium concentrates and certain nuclear fuel services are subject to price fluctuations and availability restrictions. Supply market conditions may make Generation’s procurement contracts subject to credit risk related to the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver the contracted commodity or service at the contracted prices. Approximately

60%

of Generation’s uranium concentrate requirements from


through


are supplied by three suppliers. In the event of non-performance by these or other suppliers, Generation believes that replacement uranium concentrates can be obtained, although at prices that may be unfavorable when compared to the prices under the current supply agreements. Non-performance by these counterparties could have a material adverse impact on Exelon’s and Generation’s financial statements.

Utility Registrants

ComEd entered into 20-year floating-to-fixed renewable energy swap contracts beginning in June 2012, which are considered an economic hedge and have changes in fair value recorded to an offsetting regulatory asset or liability. ComEd has block energy contracts to procure electric supply that are executed through a competitive procurement process, which are considered derivatives and qualify for NPNS, and as a result are accounted for on an accrual basis of accounting. PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE have contracts to procure electric supply that are executed through a competitive procurement process. BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE have certain full requirements contracts,



which are considered derivatives and qualify for NPNS, and as a result are accounted for on an accrual basis of accounting. Other full requirements contracts are not derivatives.

PECO, BGE and DPL also have executed derivative natural gas contracts, which either qualify for NPNS or have no mark-to-market balances because the derivatives are index priced, to hedge their long-term price risk in the natural gas market. The hedging programs for natural gas procurement have no direct impact on their financial statements. PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE do not execute derivatives for speculative or proprietary trading purposes.

Generation

The following tables provide information on Generation’s credit exposure for all derivative instruments, normal purchases and normal sales agreements, and payables and receivables, net of collateral and instruments that are subject to master netting agreements, as of

December 31, 2019

. The tables further delineate that exposure by credit rating of the counterparties and provide guidance on the concentration of credit risk to individual counterparties and an indication of the duration of a company’s credit risk by credit rating of the counterparties. The figures in the table below exclude credit risk exposure from individual retail customers, uranium procurement contracts, and exposure through RTOs, ISOs and commodity exchanges, which are discussed below.

__________

(a)

As of

December 31, 2019

, credit collateral held from counterparties where Generation had credit exposure included

$25 million

of cash and $

81 million

of letters of credit.



The Utility Registrants

Credit risk for the Utility Registrants is governed by credit and collection policies, which are aligned with state regulatory requirements. The Utility Registrants are currently obligated to provide service to all electric customers within their franchised territories. The Utility Registrants record a provision for uncollectible accounts, based upon historical experience, to provide for the potential loss from nonpayment by these customers. The Utility Registrants will monitor nonpayment from customers and will make any necessary adjustments to the provision for uncollectible accounts. See Note


—

Significant Accounting Policies

Derivative Financial Instruments

of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features (All Registrants)

Generation

As part of the normal course of business, Generation routinely enters into physical or financial contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity, natural gas and other commodities.  In accordance with the contracts and applicable law, if Generation is downgraded by a credit rating agency, especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance. Depending on Generation’s net position with a counterparty, the demand could be for the posting of collateral. In the absence of expressly agreed-to provisions that specify the collateral that must be provided, collateral requested will be a function of the facts and circumstances of the situation at the time of the demand. See Note


—

Derivative Financial Instruments

of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding collateral requirements.  See Note


— Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the letters of credit supporting the cash collateral.

Generation transacts output through bilateral contracts. The bilateral contracts are subject to credit risk, which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations. Any failure to collect these payments from counterparties could have a material impact on Exelon’s and Generation’s financial statements. As market prices rise above or fall below contracted price levels, Generation is required to post collateral with purchasers; as market prices fall below contracted price levels, counterparties are required to post collateral with Generation.  To post collateral, Generation depends on access to bank credit facilities, which serve as liquidity sources to fund collateral requirements. See

ITEM 7.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Utility Registrants

As of

December 31, 2019

, the Utility Registrants were not required to post collateral under their energy and/or natural gas procurement contracts. See Note

Regulatory Matters

and Note

Derivative Financial Instruments

of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

RTOs and ISOs (All Registrants)

All Registrants participate in all, or some, of the established, wholesale spot energy markets that are administered by PJM, ISO-NE, NYISO, CAISO, MISO, SPP, AESO, OIESO and ERCOT.  ERCOT is not subject to regulation by FERC but performs a similar function in Texas to that performed by RTOs in markets regulated by FERC.  In these areas, power is traded through bilateral agreements between buyers and sellers and on the spot energy markets that are administered by the RTOs or ISOs, as applicable. In areas where there is no spot energy market, electricity is purchased and sold solely through bilateral agreements. For sales into the spot markets administered by an RTO or ISO, the RTO or ISO maintains financial assurance policies that are established and enforced by those administrators. The credit policies of the RTOs and ISOs may, under certain circumstances, require that losses arising from the default of one member on spot energy market transactions be shared by the remaining participants.



Non-performance or non-payment by a major counterparty could result in a material adverse impact on the Registrants’ financial statements.

Exchange Traded Transactions (Exelon, Generation, PHI and DPL)

Generation enters into commodity transactions on NYMEX, ICE, NASDAQ, NGX and the Nodal exchange ("the Exchanges"). DPL enters into commodity transactions on ICE. The Exchange clearinghouses act as the counterparty to each trade. Transactions on the Exchanges must adhere to comprehensive collateral and margining requirements. As a result, transactions on Exchanges are significantly collateralized and have limited counterparty credit risk.

Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Risk (Exelon and Generation)

Exelon and Generation use a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to manage interest rate exposure. Exelon and Generation may also utilize interest rate swaps to manage their interest rate exposure. A hypothetical


basis point increase in the interest rates associated with unhedged variable-rate debt (excluding Commercial Paper) and fixed-to-floating swaps would result in approximately a

$5 million

decrease in Exelon pre-tax income for the year ended

December 31, 2019

. To manage foreign exchange rate exposure associated with international energy purchases in currencies other than U.S. dollars, Generation utilizes foreign currency derivatives, which are typically designated as economic hedges.  See Note


—

Derivative Financial Instruments

of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Equity Price Risk (Exelon and Generation)

Exelon and Generation maintain trust funds, as required by the NRC, to fund certain costs of decommissioning its nuclear plants. As of

December 31, 2019

, Generation’s NDT funds are reflected at fair value in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The mix of securities in the trust funds is designed to provide returns to be used to fund decommissioning and to compensate Generation for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs; however, the equity securities in the trust funds are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets, and the value of fixed-rate, fixed-income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates. Generation actively monitors the investment performance of the trust funds and periodically reviews asset allocation in accordance with Generation’s NDT fund investment policy. A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and decrease in equity prices would result in a

$610 million

reduction in the fair value of the trust assets. This calculation holds all other variables constant and assumes only the discussed changes in interest rates and equity prices. See Liquidity and Capital Resources section of

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of Exelon Corporation (Exelon) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Exelon’s management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of Exelon’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

. In making this assessment, management used the criteria in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, Exelon’s management concluded that, as of

December 31, 2019

, Exelon’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

The effectiveness of Exelon’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the

Board of Directors and Shareholders of Exelon Corporation

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, as listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1)(i), and the financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1)(ii), of Exelon Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the COSO.

Change in Accounting Principle

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated

financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,



accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below

are matters

arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the

consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Annual Nuclear Decommissioning Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO) Assessment

As described in Notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, Exelon Generation has a legal obligation to decommission its nuclear generation stations following the expiration of their operating licenses. To estimate its decommissioning obligation related to its nuclear generating stations for financial accounting and reporting purposes, management uses a probability-weighted cash flow model, which on a unit-by-unit basis, considers multiple scenarios that include significant estimates and assumptions such as decommissioning cost studies, cost escalation rates, probabilistic cash flow models and discount rates. Management updates its ARO annually, unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates, based on its review of updated cost studies and its annual evaluation of cost escalation factors and probabilities assigned to various scenarios. As of December 31, 2019, the nuclear decommissioning asset retirement obligation was approximately $10.5 billion.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to Exelon Generation’s annual ARO assessment is a critical audit matter are there was a significant amount of judgment by management when estimating its decommissioning obligation. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management’s cash flow model and significant assumptions, including the decommissioning cost studies. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s development of the inputs, assumptions, and model used in management’s ARO assessment. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the ARO estimates by evaluating the appropriateness of the cash flow model, testing the completeness and accuracy of data used by management, and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant assumptions, including decommissioning cost studies. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the results of decommissioning cost studies.

Impairment Assessment of Long-Lived Generation Assets

As described in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, Exelon Generation evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. Indicators of impairment may include a deteriorating business climate, including, but not limited to, declines in energy prices, condition of the asset, or plans to dispose of a long-lived asset significantly before the end of its useful life. Management determines if long-lived assets and asset groups are impaired by comparing the undiscounted expected future



cash flows to the carrying value. When the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group over its fair value. The undiscounted expected future cash flows include significant unobservable inputs including revenue and generation forecasts and projected capital and maintenance expenditures. As of December 31, 2019, the total carrying value of long-lived generation assets subject to this evaluation was approximately $24.2 billion.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to Exelon Generation’s impairment assessment of long-lived generation assets is a critical audit matter are there was a significant amount of judgment by management in assessing the recoverability of these assets or asset groups. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures to evaluate the audit evidence related to the reasonableness of management’s significant assumptions used in management's estimates, including revenue and generation forecasts. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skills and knowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s development of the inputs, assumptions, and model used to estimate the recoverability of Exelon Generation’s long-lived generation assets or asset groups. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing undiscounted expected future cash flows for long-lived generation assets by evaluating the appropriateness of the future cash flow model, testing the completeness and accuracy of the data used by management, and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant assumptions, including revenue and generation forecasts. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of revenue forecasts.

Level 3 Derivatives Significant Assumptions

As described in Notes 1, 15 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements, Exelon Generation has derivative instruments that include both observable and unobservable inputs. When valuing Level 3 derivatives, management utilizes various inputs and assumptions including forward commodity prices, commodity price volatility, contractual volumes, delivery location, interest rates, credit quality of counterparties and credit enhancements. Those derivatives with significant unobservable inputs are classified as Level 3. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had a level 3 fair value derivative asset position of $957 million and a level 3 fair value derivative liability position of $140 million.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the significant assumptions used to value Exelon Generation’s Level 3 derivatives is a critical audit matter are there was a significant amount of judgment by management in determining the inputs and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the Level 3 derivatives. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate audit evidence related to the reasonableness of management’s significant assumptions used in management’s estimates, including forward commodity prices. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s development of the inputs, assumptions, and model used to estimate the fair value of Level 3 derivatives. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for valuing the Level 3 derivatives by evaluating the appropriateness of management’s model, testing the completeness and accuracy of data used by management, and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant assumptions, including forward commodity prices. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of forward commodity prices.

Accounting for the Effects of Rate Regulation

As described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company applies the authoritative guidance for accounting for certain types of regulation, which requires management to record in their consolidated financial statements the effects of cost-based rate regulation for entities with regulated operations



that meet the following criteria, (i) rates are established or approved by a third-party regulator; (ii) rates are designed to recover the entity’s cost of providing services or products; and (iii) there is a reasonable expectation that rates designed to recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers. The Company accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with regulatory and legislative guidance from the regulatory authorities having jurisdiction under state public utility laws and the FERC under various Federal laws. Upon updates in material regulatory and legislative proceedings, where applicable, management will record new regulatory assets or liabilities and will assess whether it is probable that its currently recorded regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled, respectively, in future rates. As of December 31, 2019, there were $9.5 billion of regulatory assets and $10.4 billion of regulatory liabilities.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to accounting for the effects of rate regulation is a critical audit matter are there was a significant amount of judgment by management when assessing the impact of updates in regulation on accounting for new and existing regulatory assets and liabilities and the evaluation of whether the regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled, respectively. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment and audit effort to perform procedures relating to the accounting for the impact of regulatory and legislative proceedings on new and existing regulatory assets and liabilities.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the implementation of new regulatory matters and evaluation of existing regulatory assets and liabilities. These procedures also included, among others, obtaining the Company’s correspondence with regulators, evaluating the reasonableness of management’s judgments regarding new and updated regulatory guidance and proceedings and the related accounting implications, and calculating regulatory assets and liabilities based on provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders and other correspondence with regulators.

Description of Business (All Registrants)

Exelon is a utility services holding company engaged in the generation, delivery and marketing of energy through Generation and the energy distribution and transmission businesses through ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE.

Basis of Presentation (All Registrants)

This is a combined annual report of all Registrants. The Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements apply to the Registrants as indicated above in the Index to Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and parenthetically next to each corresponding disclosure. When appropriate, the Registrants are named specifically for their related activities and disclosures. Each of the Registrant’s Consolidated Financial Statements includes the accounts of its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.

Through its business services subsidiary, BSC, Exelon provides its subsidiaries with a variety of support services at cost, including legal, human resources, financial, information technology and supply management services. PHI also has a business services subsidiary, PHISCO, which provides a variety of support services at cost, including legal, accounting, engineering, customer operations, distribution and transmission planning, asset management, system operations, and power procurement, to PHI operating companies. The costs of BSC and PHISCO are directly charged or allocated to the applicable subsidiaries. The results of Exelon’s corporate operations are presented as “Other” within the consolidated financial statements and include intercompany eliminations unless otherwise disclosed.

for additional information of Exelon’s and Generation’s consolidated VIEs.

The Registrants consolidate the accounts of entities in which a Registrant has a controlling financial interest, after the elimination of intercompany transactions. Where the Registrants do not have a controlling financial interest in an entity, proportionate consolidation, equity method accounting or accounting for investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair value is applied. The Registrants apply proportionate consolidation when they have an undivided interest in an asset and are proportionately liable for their share of each liability associated with the asset. The Registrants proportionately consolidate their undivided ownership interests in jointly owned electric plants and transmission facilities. Under proportionate consolidation, the Registrants separately record their proportionate share of the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses related to the undivided interest in the asset. The Registrants apply equity method accounting when they have significant influence over an investee through an ownership in common stock, which generally approximates a


%

to


%

voting interest. The Registrants apply equity method accounting to certain investments and joint ventures, including certain financing trusts of ComEd and PECO. Under equity method accounting, the Registrants report their interest in the entity as an investment and the Registrants’ percentage share of the earnings from the entity as single line items in their financial statements. The Registrants use accounting for investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values if they lack significant influence, which generally results when they hold less than


%

of the common stock of an entity. Under accounting for investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values, the Registrants report their investments at cost

adjusted for changes from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, less impairment. Changes in measurement are reported in earnings.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for annual financial statements and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-K and Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC.

Use of Estimates (All Registrants)

The preparation of financial statements of each of the Registrants in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Areas in which significant estimates have been made include, but are not limited to, the accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs and other AROs, pension and OPEB, the application of purchase accounting, inventory reserves, allowance for uncollectible accounts, goodwill and asset impairments, derivative instruments, unamortized energy contracts, fixed asset depreciation, environmental costs and other loss contingencies, taxes and unbilled energy revenues. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Prior Period Adjustments and Reclassifications (Exelon, PHI and Pepco)

In the fourth quarter 2019, management identified an error related to an overstatement of the regulatory asset associated with Pepco’s decoupling mechanism for Maryland that originated in 2007 upon the inception of the program. Management has concluded that the error was not material to previously issued consolidated financial statements and the error was corrected through a revision to Exelon’s, PHI’s and Pepco’s consolidated financial statements contained herein for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.  The impact of the error correction was an

$


million

reduction to Exelon’s, PHI’s and Pepco’s opening Retained earnings as of January 1, 2017 with a corresponding reduction to current Regulatory assets of

$


million

and Deferred income taxes and unamortized investment tax credits of

$


million

. In addition, Exelon’s, PHI’s and Pepco’s Total operating revenues decreased by

$


million

for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and Net income decreased by

$


million

and

$


million

for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, from originally reported amounts. The error did not impact net cash flows provided by operating activities, net cash flows used in investing activities or net cash flows provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 for Exelon, PHI and Pepco. Exelon’s diluted earnings per share of common stock remained unchanged from the originally reported amount for the year ended December 31, 2018. Exelon’s basic earnings per share of common stock for the year ended December 31, 2018 and basic and diluted earnings per share of common stock for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by

$

0.01

from the originally reported amount.

Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies

Accounting for the Effects of Regulation (Exelon and the Utility Registrants)

For their regulated electric and gas operations, Exelon and the Utility Registrants reflect the effects of cost-based rate regulation in their financial statements, which is required for entities with regulated operations that meet the following criteria: 1) rates are established or approved by a third-party regulator; (2) rates are designed to recover the entities’ cost of providing services or products; and (3) there is a reasonable expectation that rates designed to recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers. Exelon and the Utility Registrants account for their regulated operations in accordance with regulatory and legislative guidance from the regulatory authorities having jurisdiction, principally the ICC, PAPUC, MDPSC, DCPSC, DPSC and NJBPU, under state public utility laws and the FERC under various Federal laws. Regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized and the related expense or revenue is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations consistent with the recovery or refund included in customer rates. Exelon's regulatory assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date are probable of being recovered or settled in future rates. If a separable portion of the Registrants' business was no longer able to meet the criteria discussed above, the affected entities would be required to eliminate from their consolidated financial statements the effects of regulation for that portion, which could have a material impact on their financial statements. See Note


—

Regulatory Matters

for additional information.

With the exception of income tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities, Exelon and the Utility Registrants classify regulatory assets and liabilities with a recovery or settlement period greater than one year as both current and non-current in their Consolidated Balance Sheets, with the current portion representing the amount expected to be recovered from or settled to customers over the next twelve-month period as of the balance sheet date.  Income tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities are classified entirely as non-current in Exelon's and the Utility Registrants’ Consolidated Balance Sheets to align with the classification of the related deferred income tax balances.

Exelon and the Utility Registrants treat the impacts of a final rate order received after the balance sheet date but prior to the issuance of the financial statements as a non-recognized subsequent event, as the receipt of a final rate order is a separate and distinct event that has future impacts on the parties affected by the order.

Revenues (All Registrants)

Operating Revenues.

The Registrants’ operating revenues generally consist of revenues from contracts with customers involving the sale and delivery of energy commodities and related products and services, utility revenues from ARP, and realized and unrealized revenues recognized under mark-to-market energy commodity derivative contracts. The Registrants recognize revenue from contracts with customers to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that the entities expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Generation’s primary sources of revenue include competitive sales of power, natural gas, and other energy-related products and services. The Utility Registrants’ primary sources of revenue include regulated electric and natural gas tariff sales, distribution and transmission services.  At the end of each month, the Registrants accrue an estimate for the unbilled amount of energy delivered or services provided to customers.

ComEd records ARP revenue for its best estimate of the electric distribution, energy efficiency, and transmission revenue impacts resulting from future changes in rates that ComEd believes are probable of approval by the ICC and FERC in accordance with its formula rate mechanisms. BGE, Pepco and DPL record ARP revenue for their best estimate of the electric and natural gas distribution revenue impacts resulting from future changes in rates that they believe are probable of approval by the MDPSC and/or DCPSC in accordance with their revenue decoupling mechanisms. PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE record ARP revenue for their best estimate of the transmission revenue impacts resulting from future changes in rates that they believe are probable of approval by FERC in accordance with their formula rate mechanisms. See Note


—

Regulatory Matters

for additional information.

Option Contracts, Swaps and Commodity Derivatives.

Certain option contracts and swap arrangements that meet the definition of derivative instruments are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized as revenue or expense. The classification of revenue or expense is based on the intent of the transaction. To the extent a Utility Registrant receives full cost recovery for energy procurement and related costs from retail customers, it records the fair value of its energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers as well as an offsetting regulatory asset or liability in its Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Taxes Directly Imposed on Revenue-Producing Transactions.

The Registrants collect certain taxes from customers such as sales and gross receipts taxes, along with other taxes, surcharges and fees, that are levied by

(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)

Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies

state or local governments on the sale or distribution of gas and electricity. Some of these taxes are imposed on the customer, but paid by the Registrants, while others are imposed on the Registrants. Where these taxes are imposed on the customer, such as sales taxes, they are reported on a net basis with no impact to the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. However, where these taxes are imposed on the Registrants, such as gross receipts taxes or other surcharges or fees, they are reported on a gross basis. Accordingly, revenues are recognized for the taxes collected from customers along with an offsetting expense. Se

for Generation’s, ComEd’s, PECO’s, BGE’s, Pepco's, DPL's and ACE's utility taxes that are presented on a gross basis.

Leases (All Registrants)

The Registrants recognize a ROU asset and lease liability for operating leases with a term of greater than one year. The ROU asset is included in Other deferred debits and other assets and the lease liability is included in Other current liabilities and Other deferred credits and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The ROU asset is measured as the sum of (1) the present value of all remaining fixed and in-substance fixed payments using each Registrant’s incremental borrowing rate, (2) any lease payments made at or before the commencement date (less any lease incentives received) and (3) any initial direct costs incurred.  The lease liability is measured the same as the ROU asset, but excludes any payments made before the commencement date and initial direct costs incurred. Lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease if it is reasonably certain they will be exercised. The Registrants include non-lease components for most asset classes, which are service-related costs that are not integral to the use of the asset, in the measurement of the ROU asset and lease liability.

Expense for operating leases and leases with a term of one year or less is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the derivation of benefit from use of the leased property. Variable lease payments are recognized in the period in which the related obligation is incurred and consist primarily of payments for purchases of electricity under contracted generation and are based on the electricity produced by those generating assets. Operating lease expense and variable lease payments are recorded to Purchased power and fuel expense for contracted generation or Operating and maintenance expense for all other lease agreements on the Registrants’ Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

Income from operating leases, including subleases, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the pattern in which income is earned over the term of the lease. Variable lease payments are recognized in the period in which the related obligation is performed and consist primarily of payments received from sales of electricity under contracted generation and are based on the electricity produced by those generating assets. Operating lease income and variable lease payments are recorded to Operating revenues on the Registrants’ Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

The Registrants’ operating leases consist primarily of contracted generation, real estate including office buildings, and vehicles and equipment.  The Registrants generally account for contracted generation in which the generating asset is not renewable as a lease if the customer has dispatch rights and obtains substantially all of the economic benefits.  For new agreements entered after January 1, 2019, the Registrants generally do not account for contracted generation in which the generating asset is renewable as a lease if the customer does not design the generating asset.  The Registrants account for land right arrangements that provide for exclusive use as leases while shared use land arrangements are generally not leases.  The Registrants do not account for secondary use pole attachments as leases.

See Note


—

Leases

for additional information.

Income Taxes (All Registrants)

Deferred Federal and state income taxes are recorded on significant temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for tax benefits carried forward. Investment tax credits have been deferred in the Registrants’ Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in book income over the life of the related property. The Registrants account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach; a more-likely-than-not recognition criterion; and a measurement approach that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than


%

likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit is recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. The Registrants recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax

(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)

benefits in Interest expense or Other income and deductions (interest income) and recognize penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in Other, net in their Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

Cash and Cash Equivalents (All Registrants)

The Registrants consider investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents (All Registrants)

Restricted cash and cash equivalents represent funds that are restricted to satisfy designated current liabilities. As of

December 31, 2019

and


, the Registrants' restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily represented the following items:

Restricted cash and cash equivalents not available to satisfy current liabilities are classified as noncurrent assets. As of

December 31, 2019

and


, the Registrants' noncurrent restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily represented ComEd’s over-recovered RPS costs and alternative compliance payments received from RES pursuant to FEJA and costs for the remediation of an MGP site, and ACE’s repayment of transition bonds.

Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts (All Registrants)

The allowance for uncollectible accounts reflects the Registrants’ best estimates of losses on the customers' accounts receivable balances. For Generation, the allowance is based on accounts receivable aging historical experience and other currently available information.  Utility Registrants estimate the allowance by applying loss rates developed specifically for each company to the outstanding receivable balance by customer risk segment. Utility Registrants' customer accounts are written off consistent with approved regulatory requirements.

Variable Interest Entities (Exelon, Generation, PHI and ACE)

Exelon accounts for its investments in and arrangements with VIEs based on the following specific requirements:

•

requires an entity to qualitatively assess whether it should consolidate a VIE based on whether the entity has a controlling financial interest,

•

requires an ongoing reconsideration of this assessment instead of only upon certain triggering events, and

•

requires the entity that consolidates a VIE (the primary beneficiary) to disclose (1) the assets of the consolidated VIE, if they can be used to only settle specific obligations of the consolidated VIE, and (2) the

Inventories (All Registrants)

Inventory is recorded at the lower of weighted average cost or net realizable value. Provisions are recorded for excess and obsolete inventory. Fossil fuel, materials and supplies, and emissions allowances are generally included in inventory when purchased. Fossil fuel and emissions allowances are expensed to purchased power and fuel expense when used or sold. Materials and supplies generally includes transmission, distribution and generating plant materials and are expensed to operating and maintenance or capitalized to property, plant and equipment, as appropriate, when installed or used.

Debt and Equity Security Investments (Exelon and

Generation

)

Debt Security Investments.

Debt securities are reported at fair value and classified as available-for-sale securities. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are reported in OCI.

Equity Security Investments without Readily Determinable Fair Values.

Exelon has certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values. Exelon has elected to use the practicability exception to measure these investments, defined as cost adjusted for changes from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, less impairment. Changes in measurement are reported in earnings.

Equity Security Investments with Readily Determinable Fair Values.

Equity securities held in the NDT funds are classified as equity securities with readily determinable fair values. Realized and unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on Generation’s NDT funds associated with the Regulatory Agreement Units are included in regulatory liabilities at Exelon, ComEd and PECO, in Noncurrent payables to affiliates at Generation and in Noncurrent receivables from affiliates at ComEd and PECO. Realized and unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on Generation’s NDT funds associated with the Non-Regulatory Agreement Units are included in earnings at Exelon and Generation. Exelon's and Generation's NDT funds are classified as current or noncurrent assets, depending on the timing of the decommissioning activities and income taxes on trust earnings.

Property, Plant and Equipment (All Registrants)

Property, plant and equipment is recorded at original cost. Original cost includes construction-related direct labor and material costs. The Utility Registrants also include indirect construction costs including labor and related costs of departments associated with supporting construction activities. When appropriate, original cost also includes capitalized interest for Generation, Exelon Corporate and PHI and AFUDC for regulated property at the Utility Registrants. The cost of repairs and maintenance, including planned major maintenance activities and minor replacements of property, is charged to Operating and maintenance expense as incurred.

Third parties reimburse the Utility Registrants for all or a portion of expenditures for certain capital projects. Such contributions in aid of construction costs (CIAC) are recorded as a reduction to Property, plant and equipment, net. DOE SGIG and other funds reimbursed to the Utility Registrants have been accounted for as CIAC.

For Generation, upon retirement, the cost of property is generally charged to accumulated depreciation in accordance with the composite and group methods of depreciation. Upon replacement of an asset, the costs to remove the asset, net of salvage, are capitalized to gross plant when incurred as part of the cost of the newly-installed asset and recorded to depreciation expense over the life of the new asset. Removal costs, net of salvage, incurred for property that will not be replaced is charged to Operating and maintenance expense as incurred.

For the Utility Registrants, upon retirement, the cost of property, net of salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation consistent with the composite and group methods of depreciation.  Depreciation expense at ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE includes the estimated cost of dismantling and removing plant from service upon retirement. Actual incurred removal costs are applied against a related regulatory liability or recorded to a regulatory asset if in excess of previously collected removal costs.  PECO’s removal costs are capitalized to accumulated



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)

Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies

depreciation when incurred, and recorded to depreciation expense over the life of the new asset constructed consistent with PECO’s regulatory recovery method.

Capitalized Software.

Certain costs, such as design, coding, and testing incurred during the application development stage of software projects that are internally developed or purchased for operational use are capitalized within Property, plant and equipment.

Similar costs incurred for cloud-based solutions treated as service arrangements are capitalized within Other Current Assets and Deferred Debits and Other Assets.

Such capitalized amounts are amortized ratably over the expected lives of the projects when they become operational, generally not to exceed five years. Certain other capitalized software costs are being amortized over longer lives based on the expected life or pursuant to prescribed regulatory requirements.

Capitalized Interest and AFUDC.

During construction, Exelon and Generation capitalize the costs of debt funds used to finance non-regulated construction projects. Capitalization of debt funds is recorded as a charge to construction work in progress and as a non-cash credit to interest expense.

AFUDC is the cost, during the period of construction, of debt and equity funds used to finance construction projects for regulated operations. AFUDC is recorded to construction work in progress and as a non-cash credit to an allowance that is included in interest expense for debt-related funds and other income and deductions for equity-related funds. The rates used for capitalizing AFUDC are computed under a method prescribed by regulatory authorities.

Nuclear Fuel (Exelon and Generation)

The cost of nuclear fuel is capitalized within Property, plant and equipment and charged to fuel expense using the unit-of-production method. Any potential future SNF disposal fees will be expensed through fuel expense. Additionally, certain on-site SNF storage costs are being reimbursed by the DOE since a DOE (or government-owned) long-term storage facility has not been completed.

See Note

Commitments and Contingencies

for additional information regarding the cost of SNF storage and disposal.

Nuclear Outage Costs (Exelon and Generation)

Costs associated with nuclear outages, including planned major maintenance activities, are expensed to Operating and maintenance expense or capitalized to Property, plant and equipment (based on the nature of the activities) in the period incurred.

Depreciation and Amortization (All Registrants)

Except for the amortization of nuclear fuel, depreciation is generally recorded over the estimated service lives of property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis using the group, composite or unitary methods of depreciation. The group approach is typically for groups of similar assets that have approximately the same useful lives and the composite approach is used for dissimilar assets that have different lives. Under both methods, a reporting entity depreciates the assets over the average life of the assets in the group. The Utility Registrants' depreciation expense includes the estimated cost of dismantling and removing plant from service upon retirement, which is consistent with each utility's regulatory recovery method. The estimated service lives for the Registrants are based on a combination of depreciation studies, historical retirements, site licenses and management estimates of operating costs and expected future energy market conditions.

Amortization of regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded over the recovery or refund period specified in the related legislation or regulatory order or agreement. When the recovery or refund period is less than one year, amortization is recorded to the line item in which the deferred cost or income would have originally been recorded in the Utility Registrants’ Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Amortization of ComEd’s electric distribution and energy efficiency formula rate regulatory assets and the Utility Registrants' transmission formula rate regulatory assets is recorded to Operating revenues.

Asset Retirement Obligations (All Registrants)

Generation estimates and recognizes a liability for its legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities even though the timing and/or methods of settlement may be conditional on future events. Generation generally updates its nuclear decommissioning ARO annually, unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates, based on its annual evaluation of cost escalation factors and probabilities assigned to the multiple outcome scenarios within its probability-weighted discounted cash flow models.  Generation’s multiple outcome scenarios are generally based on decommissioning cost studies which are updated, on a rotational basis, for each of Generation’s nuclear units at least every five years, unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates. AROs are accreted throughout each year to reflect the time value of money for these present value obligations through a charge to Operating and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for Non-Regulatory Agreement Units and through a decrease to regulatory liabilities for Regulatory Agreement Units or, in the case of the Utility Registrants' accretion, through an increase to regulatory assets.

See

Note 9 — Asset Retirement Obligations

for additional information.

Guarantees (All Registrants)

The Registrants recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair market value of the obligations they have undertaken by issuing the guarantee, including the ongoing obligation to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event that the specified triggering events or conditions occur.

The liability that is initially recognized at the inception of the guarantee is reduced or eliminated as the Registrants are released from risk under the guarantee.  Depending on the nature of the guarantee, the release from risk of the Registrant may be recognized only upon the expiration or settlement of the guarantee or by a systematic and rational amortization method over the term of the guarantee.

See

Note 18 — Commitments and Contingencies

for additional information.

Asset Impairments

Long-Lived Assets (All Registrants).

The

Registrants regularly monitor and evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets and asset groups for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. Indicators of impairment may include a deteriorating business climate, including, but not limited to, declines in energy prices, condition of the asset, specific regulatory disallowance, or plans to dispose of a long-lived asset significantly before the end of its useful life. The Registrants determine if long-lived assets and asset groups are impaired by comparing the undiscounted expected future cash flows to the carrying value. When the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group over its fair value. See

Note 11 — Asset Impairments

for additional information.

Goodwill (Exelon, ComEd and PHI).

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of a business.  Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. See

Note 12 — Intangible Assets

for additional information.

Equity Method Investments (Exelon and Generation).

Exelon and Generation regularly monitor and evaluate equity method investments to determine whether they are impaired.  An impairment is recorded when the investment has experienced a decline in value that is other-than-temporary in nature.  Additionally, if the entity in which Generation holds an investment recognizes an impairment loss, Exelon and Generation would record their proportionate share of that impairment loss and evaluate the investment for an other-than-temporary decline in value.



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)

Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies

Debt Security Investments (Exelon and Generation).

Declines in the fair value of debt security investments below the cost basis are reviewed to determine if such decline is other-than-temporary. If the decline is determined to be other-than-temporary, the amount of the impairment loss is included in earnings.

Equity Security Investments (Exelon and Generation).

Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured and recorded at fair value with any changes in fair value recorded through earnings. Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are qualitatively assessed for impairment each reporting period. If it is determined that the equity security is impaired on the basis of the qualitative assessment, an impairment loss will be recognized in earnings to the amount by which the security’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value.

Derivative Financial Instruments (All Registrants)

All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value unless they qualify for certain exceptions, including the NPNS. For derivatives intended to serve as economic hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings each period. Amounts classified in earnings are included in Operating revenue, Purchased power and fuel, Interest expense or Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income based on the activity the transaction is economically hedging. While the majority of the derivatives serve as economic hedges, there are also derivatives entered into for proprietary trading purposes, subject to Exelon’s Risk Management Policy, and changes in the fair value of those derivatives are recorded in revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. At the Utility Registrants, changes in fair value may be recorded as a regulatory asset or liability if there is an ability to recover or return the associated costs. Cash inflows and outflows related to derivative instruments are included as a component of operating, investing or financing cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, depending on the nature of each transaction. On July 1, 2018, Exelon and Generation de-designated its fair value and cash flow hedges. See

Note 3 — Regulatory Matters

and

Note 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments

for additional information.

As part of Generation’s energy marketing business, Generation enters into contracts to buy and sell energy to meet the requirements of its customers. These contracts include short-term and long-term commitments to purchase and sell energy and energy-related products in the energy markets with the intent and ability to deliver or take delivery of the underlying physical commodity. NPNS are contracts where physical delivery is probable, quantities are expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business over a reasonable period of time and will not be financially settled. Revenues and expenses on derivative contracts that qualify, and are designated, as NPNS are recognized when the underlying physical transaction is completed. While these contracts are considered derivative financial instruments, they are not required to be recorded at fair value, but rather are recorded on an accrual basis of accounting.

See

Note 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments

for additional information.

Retirement Benefits (All Registrants)

Exelon sponsors defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans for essentially all employees.

The plan obligations and costs of providing benefits under these plans are measured as of December 31. The measurement involves various factors assumptions, and accounting elections. The impact of assumption changes or experience different from that assumed on pension and OPEB obligations is recognized over time rather than immediately recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Gains or losses in excess of the greater of ten percent of the projected benefit obligation or the MRV of plan assets are amortized over the expected average remaining service period of plan participants.

New Accounting Standards (All Registrants)

New Accounting Standards Adopted in 2019:

In 2019, the Registrants adopted the following new authoritative accounting guidance issued by the FASB.

Cloud Computing Arrangements (Issued August 2018)

.

Aligns the requirements for capitalizing costs incurred to implement a cloud computing arrangement with the internal-use software guidance. As a result, certain implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that are currently expensed as incurred will be deferred and amortized over the non-cancellable term of the arrangement plus any reasonably certain renewal periods. The standard was effective January 1, 2020 and can be applied using either a prospective or retrospective transition approach. A retrospective approach requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)

Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies

the beginning of the period of adoption. The Registrants early adopted this standard using a prospective approach as of January 1, 2019. The new guidance did not have a material impact on the Registrants' financial statements.

Leases (Issued February 2016).

The Registrants applied the new guidance with the following transition practical expedients:

•

a "package of three" expedients that must be taken together and allow entities to (1) not reassess whether existing contracts contain leases, (2) carry forward the existing lease classification, and (3) not reassess initial direct costs associated with existing leases,

•

an implementation expedient which allows the requirements of the standard in the period of adoption with no restatement of prior periods, and

•

a land easement expedient which allows entities to not evaluate land easements under the new standard at adoption if they were not previously accounted for as leases.

The standard resulted in the Registrants recording ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases in their Consolidated Balance Sheets but did not have a material impact in the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders' Equity. The operating ROU assets and lease liabilities recognized upon adoption are materially consistent with the balances presented in the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, excluding 2019 expense and payment activity.

See Note

Leases

for additional information.

New Accounting Standards Adopted as of January 1, 2020:

The following new authoritative accounting guidance issued by the FASB was adopted as of January 1, 2020 and will be reflected by the Registrants in their consolidated financial statements beginning in the first quarter of 2020.

Impairment of Financial Instruments (Issued June 2016).

Provides for a new Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) impairment model for specified financial instruments including loans, trade receivables, debt securities classified as held-to-maturity investments and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor. Under the new guidance, on initial recognition and at each reporting period, an entity is required to recognize an allowance that reflects its current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial instrument based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The standard was effective January 1, 2020 and requires a modified retrospective transition approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. This standard is primarily applicable to Generation's and the Utility Registrants' trade accounts receivables balances. The guidance did not have a significant impact on the Registrants' consolidated financial statements.

Goodwill Impairment (Issued January 2017).

Simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the current test, which requires calculation of a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Under the revised guidance, goodwill impairment will be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill (currently Step 1 of the two-step impairment test). Entities will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. The standard was effective January 1, 2020 and must be applied on a prospective basis. Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PHI and DPL will apply the new guidance for their goodwill impairment assessments in 2020 and do not expect the updated guidance to have a material impact to their financial statements.

Note 2 — Mergers, Acquisitions and Dispositions

and committed to make preferred distributions to Generation until Generation has received aggregate distributions of

$


million

plus a return of

8.50

%

per annum. Under the Put Option Agreement, EDF has the option to sell its

49.99

%

equity interest in CENG to Generation exercisable beginning on January 1, 2016 and thereafter until June 30, 2022. On November 20, 2019, Generation received notice of EDF’s intention to exercise the put option to sell its interest in CENG to Generation and the put automatically exercised on January 19, 2020 at the end of the sixty-day advance notice period.

Under the terms of the Put Option Agreement, the purchase price is to be determined by agreement of the parties, or absent such agreement, by a third-party arbitration process. The third parties determining fair market value of EDF’s

49.99

%

interest are to take into consideration all rights and obligations under the LLC Operating Agreement and Employee Matters Agreement including but not limited to Generation’s rights with respect to any unpaid aggregate preferred distributions and the related return.  As of

December 31, 2019

, the total unpaid aggregate preferred distributions and related return owed to Generation is

$


million

. At this time, Generation cannot reasonably predict the ultimate purchase price that will be paid to EDF for its interest in CENG.  The transaction will require approval by the NYPSC, the FERC and the NRC. The process and regulatory approvals could take one to two years or more to complete.

Acquisition of James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Generating Station (Exelon and Generation)

On March 31, 2017, Generation acquired the single-unit James A. FitzPatrick (FitzPatrick) nuclear generating station located in Scriba, New York from Entergy Nuclear FitzPatrick LLC (Entergy) for a total purchase price of

$


million

, which consisted of a cash purchase price of

$


million

and a net cost reimbursement to and on behalf of Entergy of

$


million

. As part of the transaction, Generation received the FitzPatrick NDT fund assets and assumed the obligation to decommission FitzPatrick. The NRC license for FitzPatrick expires in 2034. An after-tax bargain purchase gain of

$


million

was included within Exelon's and Generation's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income which primarily reflects differences in strategies between Generation and Entergy for the intended use and ultimate decommissioning of the plant.

Exelon and Generation incurred

$


million

of merger and integration related costs for FitzPatrick for the year ended December 31, 2017 which are included within Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon's and Generation's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

Disposition of Oyster Creek

(Exelon and Generation)

On July 31, 2018, Generation entered into an agreement with Holtec International (Holtec) and its indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Oyster Creek Environmental Protection, LLC (OCEP), for the sale and decommissioning of Oyster Creek located in Forked River, New Jersey, which permanently ceased generation operations on September 17, 2018. Completion of the transaction contemplated by the sale agreement was subject to the satisfaction of several closing conditions, including approval of the license transfer from the NRC and other regulatory approvals, and a private letter ruling from the IRS, which were satisfied in the second quarter 2019.  The sale was completed on July 1, 2019. Exelon and Generation recognized a loss on the sale in the third quarter, which was immaterial.

Under the terms of the transaction, Generation transferred to OCEP substantially all the assets associated with Oyster Creek, including assets held in NDT funds, along with the assumption of liability for all responsibility for the site, including full decommissioning and ongoing management of spent fuel until the spent fuel is moved offsite. The terms of the transaction also include various forms of performance assurance for the obligations of OCEP to timely complete the required decommissioning, including a parental guaranty from Holtec for all performance and payment obligations of OCEP, and a requirement for Holtec to deliver a letter of credit to Generation upon the occurrence of specified events.

As a result of the transaction, in the third quarter of 2018, Exelon and Generation reclassified certain Oyster Creek assets and liabilities in Exelon’s and Generation’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as held for sale at their respective fair values. Exelon and Generation had

$


million

and

$


million

of Assets and Liabilities held for sale, respectively, at December 31, 2018. Upon remeasurement of the Oyster Creek ARO, Exelon and Generation recognized an

$


million

and a

$


million

pre-tax charge to Operating and maintenance expense in the third quarter of 2018 and in the second quarter of 2019, respectively. See

Note 9 — Asset Retirement Obligations

Disposition of EGTP and Acquisition of Handley Generating Station (Exelon and Generation)

EGTP, a Delaware limited liability company, was formed in 2014 with the purpose of financing a portfolio of assets comprised of two combined-cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) and three peaking/simple cycle facilities consisting of approximately

3.4

GW of generation capacity in ERCOT North and Houston Zones. EGTP was an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon and Generation.

EGTP’s operating cash flows were negatively impacted by certain market conditions and the seasonality of its cash flows.  On May 2, 2017, as a result of the negative impacts of certain market conditions and the seasonality of its cash flows, EGTP entered into a consent agreement with its lenders to permit EGTP to draw on its revolving credit facility and initiate an orderly sales process to sell the assets of its wholly owned subsidiaries.  As a result, Exelon and Generation classified certain of EGTP assets and liabilities as held for sale at their respective fair values less costs to sell and recorded a

$


million

pre-tax impairment loss. See

Note 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements

for details regarding the nonrecourse debt associated with EGTP and

Note 11 — Asset Impairments

for additional information.

On November 7, 2017, EGTP and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, which resulted in Exelon and Generation deconsolidating EGTP's assets and liabilities from their consolidated financial statements in the fourth quarter of 2017 that resulted in a pre-tax gain upon deconsolidation of

$


million

. Concurrently with the Chapter 11 filings, Generation entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire one of EGTP's generating plants, the Handley Generating Station, subject to a potential adjustment for fuel oil and assumption of certain liabilities. In the Chapter 11 Filings, EGTP requested that the proposed acquisition of the Handley Generating Station be consummated through a court-approved and supervised sales process. The acquisition closed on April 4, 2018 for a purchase price of

$


million

. The Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings were finalized on April 17, 2018, resulting in the ownership of EGTP assets (other than the Handley Generating Station) being transferred to EGTP's lenders.

Disposition of Electrical Contracting Business

(Exelon and Generation)

On February 28, 2018, Generation completed the sale of its interest in an electrical contracting business that primarily installs, maintains and repairs underground and high-voltage cable transmission and distribution systems  for

$


million

, resulting in a pre-tax gain which is included within Gain on sales of assets and businesses in Exelon's and Generation's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Completed Distribution Base Rate Case Proceedings

__________

(a)

Pursuant to EIMA and FEJA, ComEd’s electric distribution rates are established through a performance-based formula, which sunsets at the end of 2022.  ComEd is required to file an annual update to its electric distribution formula rate on or before May 1

st

, with resulting rates effective in January of the following year.  ComEd’s annual electric distribution formula rate update is based on prior year actual costs and current year projected capital additions (initial year revenue requirement). The update also reconciles any differences between the revenue requirement in effect for the prior year and actual costs incurred from the year (annual reconciliation).

ComEd’s 2018 approved revenue requirement above reflects a decrease of

$


million for the initial year revenue requirement for 2018 and an increase of

$


million related to the annual reconciliation for 2017. The revenue requirement for 2018 and the annual reconciliation for 2017 provides for a weighted average debt and equity return on distribution rate base of

6.52

%

Note 3 — Regulatory Matters

inclusive of an allowed ROE of

8.69

%

, reflecting the average rate on 30-year treasury notes plus


basis points. ComEd’s 2019 approved revenue requirement above reflects an increase of

$


million for the initial year revenue requirement for 2019 and a decrease of

$


million related to the annual reconciliation for 2018. The revenue requirement for 2019 and the annual reconciliation for 2018 provides for a weighted average debt and equity return on distribution rate base of

6.51

%

inclusive of an allowed ROE of

8.91

%

, reflecting the average rate on 30-year treasury notes plus


basis points. See table below for ComEd's regulatory assets associated with its electric distribution formula rate.

During the first quarter of 2018, ComEd revised its electric distribution formula rate to implement revenue decoupling provisions provided for under FEJA. As a result of this revision, ComEd’s electric distribution formula rate revenues are not impacted by abnormal weather, usage per customer or numbers of customers. ComEd began reflecting the impacts of this change in its Operating revenues and electric distribution formula rate regulatory asset in the first quarter of 2017.

(b)

The PECO rate case proceeding was resolved through a settlement agreement, which did not specify an approved ROE.

Transmission Formula Rates

Transmission Formula Rate (Exelon, ComEd, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE).

ComEd’s, BGE’s, Pepco's, DPL's and ACE's transmission rates are each established based on a FERC-approved formula.  ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE are required to file an annual update to the FERC-approved formula on or before May 15, with the resulting rates effective on June 1 of the same year.  The annual formula rate update is based on prior year actual costs and current year projected capital additions (initial year revenue requirement). The update also reconciles any differences between the revenue requirement in effect beginning June 1 of the prior year and actual costs incurred for that year (annual reconciliation).

Transmission Formula Rate (Exelon and PECO).

On May 1, 2017, PECO filed a request with FERC seeking approval to update its transmission rates and change the manner in which PECO’s transmission rate is determined from a fixed rate to a formula rate. The formula rate will be updated annually to ensure that under this rate customers pay the actual costs of providing transmission services. PECO’s initial formula rate filing included a requested increase of

$


million

to PECO’s annual transmission revenue requirement, which reflected a ROE of


%

, inclusive of a


basis point adder for  being a member of a RTO. On June 27, 2017, FERC issued an Order accepting the filing and suspending the proposed rates until December 1, 2017, subject to refund, and set the matter for hearing and settlement judge procedures.

On December 5, 2019, FERC issued an Order accepting without modification the settlement agreement filed by PECO and other parties in July 2019. The settlement results in an increase of approximately

$


million

with a return on rate base of

7.62

%

compared to PECO's initial formula rate filing and allows for an ROE of

10.35

%

, inclusive of a


basis point adder for being a member of the RTO. The settlement did not have a material impact on PECO's 2017, 2018, or 2019 annual transmission revenue requirements. PECO will update its rates in 2020 and refund estimated overcollections totaling approximately

$


million

related to the amounts billed under the proposed rates in effect since 2017.

Pursuant to the transmission formula rate request discussed above, PECO made its annual formula rate updates in May 2018 and 2019, which included a decrease of

$


million

and an increase of

$


million

, respectively, to the annual transmission revenue requirement. The updated transmission formula rates were effective on June 1, 2018 and 2019, respectively, subject to refund.

Energy Efficiency Formula Rate (Exelon and ComEd).

FEJA allows ComEd to defer energy efficiency costs (except for any voltage optimization costs which are recovered through the electric distribution formula rate) as a separate regulatory asset that is recovered through the energy efficiency formula rate over the weighted average useful life, as approved by the ICC, of the related energy efficiency measures.  ComEd earns a return on the energy efficiency regulatory asset at a rate equal to its weighted average cost of capital, which is based on a year-end capital structure and calculated using the same methodology applicable to ComEd’s electric distribution formula rate.  Beginning January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2030, the return on equity that ComEd earns on its energy efficiency regulatory asset is subject to a maximum downward or upward adjustment of 200 basis points if ComEd’s

cumulative persisting annual MWh savings falls short of or exceeds specified percentage benchmarks of its annual incremental savings goal.  ComEd is required to file an update to its energy efficiency formula rate on or before June 1

st

each year, with resulting rates effective in January of the following year.  The annual update is based on projected current year energy efficiency costs, PJM capacity revenues, and the projected year-end regulatory asset balance less any related deferred income taxes (initial year revenue requirement).  The update also reconciles any differences between the revenue requirement in effect for the prior year and actual costs incurred from the year (annual reconciliation).   The approved energy efficiency formula rate also provides for revenue decoupling provisions similar to those in ComEd’s electric distribution formula rate.

During 2019, the ICC approved the following total increases in ComEd's requested energy efficiency revenue requirement:

_________

(a)

ComEd’s 2020 approved revenue requirement above reflects an increase of

$


million

for the initial year revenue requirement for 2020 and a decrease of

$


million

related to the annual reconciliation for 2018. The revenue requirement for 2020 provides for a weighted average debt and equity return on the energy efficiency regulatory asset and rate base of

6.51

%

inclusive of an allowed ROE of

8.91

%

, reflecting the average rate on 30-year treasury notes plus


basis points. See table below for ComEd's regulatory assets associated with its energy efficiency formula rate.

Maryland Regulatory Matters

Maryland Alternative Rate Plans Rulemaking (Exelon, BGE, PHI, Pepco and DPL).

On August 9, 2019, the MDPSC issued an order in which the MDPSC determined that it is now appropriate to move forward to implement alternative rate plans in Maryland.  The MDPSC found that a multi-year rate plan, based on a historic test year and allowing up to three future test years, can produce just and reasonable rates.  A working group was convened and submitted a detailed implementation report related to multi-year rate plans to the MDPSC on December 20, 2019.  In response to the working group report, the MDPSC issued an order on February 4, 2020 establishing a multi-year rate plan pilot and an associated framework for a Maryland utility to use in the pilot multi-year rate plan filing. The working group was required to continue and discuss how best to integrate performance-based measures into a multi-year rate plan. The working group is currently discussing performance-based measures which could be combined with future multi-year rate plans and will submit its report to the MDPSC by April 1, 2020. BGE, Pepco and DPL cannot predict the outcome or the potential financial impact, if any, on BGE, Pepco or DPL.

The Maryland Strategic Infrastructure Development and Enhancement Program (Exelon and BGE).

On December 1, 2017 (as amended on January 22, 2018), BGE filed an application with the MDPSC seeking approval for a new gas infrastructure replacement plan and associated surcharge, effective for the five-year period from 2019 through 2023. On May 30, 2018, the MDPSC approved with modifications a new infrastructure plan and associated surcharge, subject to BGE's acceptance of the Order. On June 1, 2018, BGE accepted the MDPSC Order and the associated surcharge became effective January 2019. The five-year plan calls for capital expenditures over the 2019-2023 timeframe of

$


million with an associated revenue requirement of

$


million.

Cash Working Capital Order (Exelon and BGE).

On November 17, 2016, the MDPSC rendered a decision in the proceeding to review BGE’s request to recover its cash working capital (CWC) requirement for its Provider of Last Resort service, also known as Standard Offer Service (SOS), as well as other components that make up the Administrative Charge, the mechanism that enables BGE to recover its SOS-related costs.  The Administrative Charge is comprised of five components:  CWC, uncollectibles, incremental costs, return, and an administrative adjustment, which acts as a proxy for retail suppliers’ costs.  The MDPSC accepted BGE's positions on recovery of CWC and pass-through recovery of BGE’s actual uncollectibles and incremental costs.  The order also grants BGE a return on the SOS. Subsequently, the MDPSC Staff and residential consumer advocate sought clarification and appealed the amount of return awarded to BGE on the SOS. The appeal currently resides with the Maryland Court of Special Appeals. Also, in BGE’s 2019 electric and gas distribution base rate proceeding, the MDPSC established a normalized administrative adjustment. However, a group of electric suppliers appealed the MDPSC’s decision to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. BGE cannot predict the outcome of these appeals.

ACE Infrastructure Investment Program Filing (Exelon, PHI and ACE).

On February 28, 2018, ACE filed with the NJBPU the company’s Infrastructure Investment Program (IIP) proposing to seek recovery of a series of investments through a new rider mechanism, totaling

$


million

, between 2019-2022 to provide safe and reliable service for its customers. The IIP will allow for more timely recovery of investments made to modernize and enhance ACE’s electric system. On April 15, 2019, ACE entered into a settlement agreement with other parties, which allows for a recovery totaling

$


million

of reliability related capital investments from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2023. On April 18, 2019, the NJBPU approved the settlement agreement.

New Jersey Clean Energy Legislation (Exelon, PHI and ACE).

On May 23, 2018, New Jersey enacted legislation that established and modified New Jersey’s clean energy and energy efficiency programs and solar and renewable energy portfolio standards. On the same day, New Jersey enacted legislation that established a ZEC program that  provides compensation for nuclear plants that demonstrate to the NJBPU that they meet certain requirements, including that they make a significant contribution to air quality in the state and that their revenues are insufficient to cover their costs and risks. Electric distribution utilities in New Jersey, including ACE, began collecting from retail distribution customers, through a non-bypassable charge, all costs associated with the utility’s procurement of the ZECs effective April 18, 2019. See Generation Regulatory Matters below for additional information.

Other Federal Regulatory Matters

Transmission-Related Income Tax Regulatory Assets (Exelon, ComEd, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE).

On December 13, 2016 (and as amended on March 13, 2017), BGE filed with FERC to begin recovering certain existing and future transmission-related income tax regulatory assets through its transmission formula rate. BGE’s existing regulatory assets included (1) amounts that, if BGE’s transmission formula rate provided for recovery, would have been previously amortized and (2) amounts that would be amortized and recovered prospectively. ComEd, Pepco, DPL and ACE had similar transmission-related income tax regulatory liabilities and assets also requiring FERC approval.  On November 16, 2017, FERC issued an order rejecting BGE’s proposed revisions to its transmission formula rate to recover these transmission-related income tax regulatory assets. As a result of the FERC's order, ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE took a charge to Income tax expense within their Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income in the fourth quarter of 2017, reducing their associated transmission-related income tax regulatory assets for the portion of the total transmission-related income tax regulatory assets that would have been previously amortized and recovered through rates.  Similar regulatory assets and liabilities at PECO are not subject to the same FERC transmission rate recovery formula. See above for additional information regarding PECO's transmission formula rate filing.

On December 18, 2017, BGE filed for clarification and rehearing of FERC’s November 16, 2017 order and on February 23, 2018 (as amended on July 9, 2018), ComEd, Pepco, DPL, and ACE each filed with FERC to revise their transmission formula rate mechanisms to permit recovery of transmission-related income tax regulatory assets, including those amounts that would have been previously amortized and recovered through rates had the transmission formula rate provided for such recovery.

On September 7, 2018, FERC issued orders rejecting BGE’s December 18, 2017 request for rehearing and clarification and ComEd's, Pepco's, DPL's and ACE's February 23, 2018 (as amended on July 9, 2018) filings, citing the lack of timeliness of the requests to recover amounts that would have been previously amortized, but indicating that ongoing recovery of certain transmission-related income tax regulatory assets would provide for a more accurate revenue requirement, consistent with its November 16, 2017 order.

On October 1, 2018, ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE submitted filings to recover ongoing non-TCJA amortization amounts and refund TCJA transmission-related income tax regulatory liabilities for the prospective period starting on October 1, 2018. In addition, on October 9, 2018, ComEd, Pepco, DPL, and ACE sought rehearing of FERC's September 7, 2018 order. On November 2, 2018, BGE filed an appeal of FERC's September 7, 2018 order to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. On April 26, 2019 FERC issued an order accepting ComEd's, BGE's, Pepco's, DPL's, and ACE's October 1, 2018 filings, effective October 1, 2018, subject to refund and established hearing and settlement judge procedures. ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.

If FERC ultimately rules that the future, ongoing non-TCJA amortization amounts are not recoverable, Exelon, ComEd, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE would record additional charges to Income tax expense, which could be

PJM Transmission Rate Design (All Registrants).

On June 15, 2016, several parties, including the Utility Registrants, filed a proposed settlement with FERC to resolve outstanding issues related to cost responsibility for charges to transmission customers for certain transmission facilities that operate at or above 500 kV. The settlement included provisions for monthly credits or charges related to the periods prior to January 1, 2016 that are expected to be refunded or recovered through PJM wholesale transmission rates through December 2025. On May 31, 2018, FERC issued an order approving the settlement. Pursuant to the order, similar charges for the period January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2018 would also be refunded or recovered through PJM wholesale transmission rates over the subsequent 12-month period. PJM commenced billing the refunds and charges associated with this settlement in August 2018.

The Utility Registrants recorded the following payables to/receivables from PJM and related regulatory assets/liabilities in 2018 and have been refunding or recovering these amounts through electric distribution customer rates. Generation recorded a

Generation Regulatory Matters (Exelon and Generation)

Illinois Regulatory Matters

Zero Emission Standard.

Pursuant to FEJA, on January 25, 2018, the ICC announced that Generation’s Clinton Unit 1, Quad Cities Unit 1 and Quad Cities Unit 2 nuclear plants were selected as the winning bidders through the IPA's ZEC procurement event.

Generation executed the ZEC procurement contracts with Illinois utilities, including ComEd, effective January 26, 2018 and began recognizing revenue with compensation for the sale of ZECs retroactive to the June 1, 2017 effective date of FEJA. The ZEC price was initially established at

$

16.50

per MWh of production, subject to annual future adjustments determined by the IPA for specified escalation and pricing adjustment mechanisms designed to lower the ZEC price based on increases in underlying energy and capacity prices. Illinois utilities are required to purchase all ZECs delivered by the zero-emissions nuclear-powered generating facilities, subject to annual cost caps. For the initial delivery year, June 1, 2017 to May 31, 2018, and subsequent delivery year, June 1, 2018 to May 31, 2019, the ZEC annual cost cap was set at

$


million

(ComEd’s share is approximately

$


million

). For subsequent delivery years, the IPA-approved targeted ZEC procurement amounts will change based on forward energy and capacity prices. ZECs delivered to Illinois utilities in excess of the annual cost cap may be paid in subsequent years if the payments do not exceed the prescribed annual cost cap for that year. During the first quarter of 2018, Generation recognized

$


million

of revenue related to ZECs generated from June 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017.

On February 14, 2017, two lawsuits were filed in the Northern District of Illinois against the IPA alleging that the state’s ZEC program violates certain provisions of the U.S. Constitution. Both lawsuits argued that the Illinois ZEC program would distort PJM's FERC-approved energy and capacity market auction system of setting wholesale prices and sought a permanent injunction preventing the implementation of the program. The lawsuits were dismissed by the district court on July 14, 2017. On September 13, 2018, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the lower court's dismissal of both lawsuits. On January 7, 2019, plaintiffs filed a petition seeking U.S. Supreme Court review of the case, which was denied on April 15, 2019.

New Jersey Regulatory Matters

New Jersey Clean Energy Legislation

On May 23, 2018, New Jersey enacted legislation that established a ZEC program that will provide compensation for nuclear plants that demonstrate to the NJBPU that they meet certain requirements, including that they make a significant contribution to air quality in the state and that their revenues are insufficient to cover their costs and risks. Under the legislation, the NJBPU will issue ZECs to qualifying nuclear power plants and the electric distribution utilities in New Jersey, including ACE, will be required to purchase those ZECs. Selected nuclear plants will receive annual ZEC payments for each energy year (12-month period from June 1 through May 31) within 90 days after the completion of such energy year. The quantity of ZECs issued will be

Note 3 — Regulatory Matters

determined based on the greater of 40% of the total number of MWh of electricity distributed by the public electric distribution utilities in New Jersey in the prior year, or the total number of MWh of electricity generated in the prior year by the selected nuclear power plants. The ZEC price is approximately

$


per MWh during the first 3-year eligibility period. For eligibility periods following the first 3-year eligibility period, the NJBPU has discretion to reduce the ZEC price.

On November 19, 2018, NJBPU issued an order providing for the method and application process for determining the eligibility of nuclear power plants, a draft method and process for ranking and selecting eligible nuclear power plants, and the establishment of a mechanism for each regulated utility to purchase ZECs from selected nuclear power plants. On December 19, 2018, PSEG filed complete applications seeking NJBPU approval for Salem 1 and Salem 2, of which Generation owns a

42.59

%

ownership interest, to participate in the ZEC program. On April 18, 2019, the NJBPU approved the award of ZECs to Salem 1 and Salem 2. Upon approval, Generation began recognizing revenue for the sale of New Jersey ZECs in the month they are generated and has recognized

$


million

for the year ended December 31, 2019. On May 15, 2019, New Jersey Rate Counsel appealed the NJBPU’s decision to the New Jersey Superior Court. The appeal does not prevent implementation of the ZEC program. Exelon and Generation cannot predict the outcome of the appeal. See Note

New York Regulatory Matters

New York Clean Energy Standard.

On August 1, 2016, the NYPSC issued an order establishing the New York CES, a component of which is a Tier 3 ZEC program targeted at preserving the environmental attributes of zero-emissions nuclear-powered generating facilities that meet the criteria demonstrating public necessity as determined by the NYPSC to be Generation's FitzPatrick, Ginna and Nine Mile Point nuclear facilities. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) centrally procures the ZECs through a 12-year contract extending from April 1, 2017 through March 31, 2029, administered in six two-year tranches. ZEC payments are made based upon the number of MWh produced by each facility, subject to specified caps and minimum performance requirements. The ZEC price for the first tranche was set at

$

17.48

per MWh of production and is administratively determined using a formula based on the social cost of carbon as determined in 2016 by the federal government, subject to pricing adjustments designed to lower the ZEC price based on increases in underlying energy and capacity prices.  Following the first tranche, the price will be updated bi-annually.  Each Load Serving Entity (LSE) is required to purchase an amount of ZECs from NYSERDA equivalent to its load ratio share of the total electric energy in the New York Control Area.  Cost recovery from ratepayers is incorporated into the commodity charges on customer bills.

On October 19, 2016, a coalition of fossil-generation companies filed a complaint in federal district court against the NYPSC alleging that the ZEC program violates certain provisions of the U.S. Constitution; specifically, that the ZEC program interferes with FERC’s jurisdiction over wholesale rates and that it discriminates against out of state competitors, which was dismissed by the district court on July 25, 2017. On September 27, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the lower court's dismissal of the complaint against the ZEC program. On January 7, 2019, the fossil-generation companies filed a petition seeking U.S. Supreme Court review of the case which was denied on April 15, 2019.

In addition, on November 30, 2016 (as amended on January 13, 2017), a group of parties filed a Petition in New York State court seeking to invalidate the ZEC program, which argued that the NYPSC did not have authority to establish the program, that it violated state environmental law and that it violated certain technical provisions of the State Administrative Procedures Act when adopting the ZEC program. Subsequently, Generation, CENG and the NYPSC filed motions to dismiss the state court action, which were later opposed by the plaintiffs. On January 22, 2018, the court dismissed the environmental claims and the majority of the plaintiffs from the case but denied the motions to dismiss with respect to the remaining five plaintiffs and claims, without commenting on the merits of the case. On October 8, 2019, the court dismissed all remaining claims. The petitioners filed a notice of appeal on November 4, 2019 and have until May 4, 2020 to file their brief.

Note 3 — Regulatory Matters

& Electric Company (RG&E) to negotiate a RSSA to support the continued operation of Ginna to maintain the reliability of the RG&E transmission grid for a specified period of time.

On April 8, 2016, FERC accepted Ginna’s compliance filing and on April 20, 2016, the NYPSC accepted the revised RSSA with a term expiring on March 31, 2017. In April 2016, Generation began recognizing revenue based on the final approved pricing contained in the RSSA and also recognized a one-time revenue adjustment of

$


million

representing the net cumulative previously unrecognized amount of revenue retroactive from the April 1, 2015 effective date through March 31, 2016.  A

49.99

%

portion of the one-time adjustment was removed from Generation’s results of operations as a result of the noncontrolling interests in CENG.

The RSSA required Ginna to continue operating through the RSSA term. On September 30, 2016, Ginna filed the required notice with the NYPSC of its intent to continue operating beyond the March 31, 2017 expiry of the RSSA, conditioned upon successful execution of an agreement between Ginna and NYSERDA for the sale of ZECs under the New York CES. Subject to prevailing over any administrative or legal challenges, it is expected the New York CES will allow Ginna to continue to operate through the end of its current operating license in 2029.

Federal Regulatory Matters

PJM and NYISO MOPR Proceedings.

PJM and NYISO capacity markets include a Minimum Offer Price Rule (MOPR). If a resource is subjected to a MOPR, its offer is adjusted to effectively remove the revenues it receives through a government-provided financial support program - resulting in a higher offer that may not clear the capacity market. Prior to December 19, 2019, the MOPR in PJM applied only to certain new gas-fired resources. Currently, the MOPR in NYISO continues to apply to certain new gas-fired resources.

In January 2017 and May 2018, EPSA filed pleadings at FERC that generally allege that the NYISO and PJM MOPRs should be expanded to apply to existing resources including those receiving ZEC compensation under the New Jersey ZEC (Salem), New York CES (FitzPatrick, Ginna and Nine Mile Point) and Illinois ZES (Quad Cities) programs. For Generation’s facilities in PJM and NYISO that are currently receiving ZEC compensation, an expanded MOPR would require exclusion of ZEC compensation when bidding into future capacity auctions, resulting in an increased risk of these facilities not receiving capacity revenues in future auctions. Exelon filed protests at FERC in response to each filing, arguing generally that ZEC payments provide compensation for an environmental attribute and are no different than other renewable support programs that have generally not been subject to a MOPR.

On December 19, 2019, FERC issued an order in the PJM MOPR proceeding that broadly applies the MOPR to all new and existing resources including nuclear, renewables, demand response, energy efficiency, storage and all resources owned by vertically-integrated utilities, greatly expanding the breadth and scope of PJM’s MOPR, effective as of PJM’s next capacity auction, the timing of which cannot be predicted at this time.  FERC directed PJM to make a compliance filing within 90 days. FERC has no deadline for acting on PJM’s compliance filing. While FERC included some limited exemptions (generally available to existing renewable, energy efficiency, demand response, storage and existing vertically-integrated utility resources) in its order, no exemptions were available to state-supported nuclear resources. In addition, FERC provided no new mechanism for accommodating state-supported resources other than the existing FRR mechanism under which an entire utility zone would be removed from PJM’s capacity auction along with sufficient resources to support the load in such zone.  Unless Illinois and New Jersey can implement an FRR program in their PJM zones, the MOPR will apply to Generation's owned or jointly owned nuclear plants in those states receiving a benefit under the Illinois ZES or the New Jersey ZEC program, as applicable, resulting in higher offers for those units that may not clear the capacity market.

On January 21, 2020, Exelon, PJM and a number of other entities submitted individual requests for rehearing of FERC’s December 19, 2019 order on the PJM MOPR.  FERC routinely extends the deadline by which it must address requests for rehearing.  FERC has not yet acted, and has no deadline by which it must act, in the NYISO proceeding.

Exelon is currently working with PJM and other stakeholders to pursue the FRR option prior to the next capacity auction in PJM. If Illinois implements the FRR option, Generation’s Illinois nuclear plants could be removed from PJM’s capacity auction and instead supply capacity and be compensated under the FRR program, which has the potential to mitigate the current economic distress being experienced by Generation's nuclear plants in Illinois, as discussed in Note

Early Plant Retirements

. Implementing the FRR program in Illinois will require both legislative

and regulatory changes.  Legislation may be introduced in New Jersey as well. Exelon cannot predict whether such legislative and regulatory changes can be implemented prior to the next capacity auction in PJM.

If Generation’s state-supported nuclear plants in PJM or NYISO are subjected to the MOPR without compensation under an FRR or similar program, it could have a material adverse impact on Exelon's and Generation's financial statements.

Operating License Renewals

Conowingo Hydroelectric Project

.

On August 29, 2012, Generation submitted a hydroelectric license application to FERC for a new license for the Conowingo Hydroelectric Project (Conowingo). In connection with Generation’s efforts to obtain a water quality certification pursuant to Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (401 Certification) from MDE for Conowingo, Generation has been working with MDE and other stakeholders to resolve water quality licensing issues, including: (1) water quality, (2) fish habitat, and (3) sediment.

On April 21, 2016, Generation and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior executed a settlement agreement (DOI Settlement) resolving all fish passage issues between the parties.

On April 27, 2018, MDE issued its 401 Certification for Conowingo. As issued, the 401 Certification contains numerous conditions, including those relating to reduction of nutrients from upstream sources, removal of all visible trash and debris from upstream sources, and implementation of measures relating to fish passage, which could have a material, unfavorable impact on Exelon’s and Generation’s financial statements through an increase in capital expenditures and operating costs if implemented. On May 25, 2018, Generation filed complaints in federal and state court, along with a petition for reconsideration with MDE, alleging that the conditions are unfair and onerous and in violation of MDE regulations and state, federal, and constitutional law. Generation also requested that FERC defer the issuance of the federal license while these significant state and federal law issues are pending. On February 28, 2019, Generation filed a Petition for Declaratory Order with FERC requesting that FERC issue an order declaring that MDE waived its right to issue a 401 Certification for Conowingo because it failed to timely act on Conowingo’s 401 Certification application and requesting that FERC decline to include the conditions required by MDE in April 2018.

On October 29, 2019, Generation and MDE filed with FERC a Joint Offer of Settlement (Offer of Settlement) that would resolve all outstanding issues relating to the 401 Certification. Pursuant to the Offer of Settlement, the parties submitted Proposed License Articles to FERC to be incorporated by FERC into the new license in accordance with FERC’s discretionary authority under the Federal Power Act. Among the Proposed License Articles are modifications to river flows to improve aquatic habitat, eel passage improvements and initiatives to support rare, threatened and endangered wildlife. If FERC approves the Offer of Settlement and incorporates the Proposed License Articles into the new license without modification, then MDE would waive its rights to issue a 401 Certification and Generation would agree, pursuant to a separate agreement with MDE (MDE Settlement), to implement additional environmental protection, mitigation and enhancement measures over the anticipated 50-year term of the new license. These measures address mussel restoration and other ecological and water quality matters, among other commitments. Exelon’s commitments under the various provisions of the Offer of Settlement and MDE Settlement are not effective unless and until FERC approves the Offer of Settlement and issues the new license with the Proposed License Articles.

The financial impact of the DOI and MDE Settlements and other anticipated license commitments are estimated to be

$


million

to

$


million

per year, on average, recognized over the new license term, including capital and operating costs. The actual timing and amount of the majority of these costs are not currently fixed and will vary from year to year throughout the life of the new license. Generation cannot currently predict when FERC will issue the new license.  As of

December 31, 2019

,

$


million

of direct costs associated with Conowingo licensing efforts have been capitalized. Generation's current depreciation provision for Conowingo assumes renewal of the FERC license.

Peach Bottom Units 2 and 3

.

On July 10, 2018, Generation submitted a second 20-year license renewal application with the NRC for Peach Bottom Units 2 and 3. Generation anticipates the second license renewal in the first half of 2020.  Peach Bottom Units 2 and 3 are currently licensed to operate through 2033 and 2034, respectively. See Note

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

(All Registrants)

The Registrants recognize revenue from contracts with customers to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entities expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Generation’s primary sources of revenue include competitive sales of power, natural gas, and other energy-related products and services.  The Utility Registrants’ primary sources of revenue include regulated electric and gas tariff sales, distribution and transmission services. The performance obligations, revenue recognition and payment terms associated with these sources of revenue are further discussed in the table below. There are no significant financing components for these sources of revenue and no variable consideration for regulated electric and gas tariff sales and regulated transmission services unless noted below.

Unless otherwise noted, for each of the significant revenue categories and related performance obligations described below, the Registrants have the right to consideration from the customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value transferred to the customer for the performance completed to date. Therefore, the Registrant's generally recognize revenue in the amount for which they have the right to invoice the customer.  As a result, there are generally no significant judgments used in determining or allocating the transaction price.



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)

Note 4 — Revenue from Contracts with Customers

__________

(a)

Certain contracts may contain limits on the total amount of revenue Exelon and Generation are able to collect over the entire term of the contract. In such cases, Exelon and Generation estimate the total consideration expected to be received over the term of the contract net of the constraint and allocate the expected consideration to the performance obligations in the contract such that revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the entire contract as the performance obligations are satisfied.

(b)

The method recognizes revenue based on the various inputs used to satisfy the performance obligation, such as costs incurred and total labor hours expended. The total amount of revenue that will be recognized is based on the agreed upon contractually-stated amount. The average contract term for these projects is approximately 18 months.

(c)

Electric and natural gas utility customers have the choice to purchase electricity or natural gas from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers.  While the Utility Registrants are required under state legislation to bill their customers



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)

Note 4 — Revenue from Contracts with Customers

for the supply and distribution of electricity and/or natural gas, they recognize revenue related only to the distribution services when customers purchase their electricity or natural gas from competitive suppliers.

(d)

Passage of time is used for NITS and access to the wholesale grid and MWHs of energy transported over the wholesale grid is used for scheduling, system control and dispatch services.

Generation incurs incremental costs in order to execute certain retail power and gas sales contracts.  These costs, which primarily relate to retail broker fees and sales commissions, are capitalized when incurred as contract acquisition costs and were immaterial as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The Utility Registrants do not incur any material costs to obtain or fulfill contracts with customers.

Contract Balances (All Registrants)

Contract Assets and Liabilities

Generation records contract assets for the revenue recognized on the construction and installation of energy efficiency assets and new power generating facilities before Generation has an unconditional right to bill for and receive the consideration from the customer. These contract assets are subsequently reclassified to receivables when the right to payment becomes unconditional. Generation records contract assets and contract receivables within Other current assets and Accounts receivable, net - Customer, respectively, within Exelon’s and Generation’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Generation records contract liabilities when consideration is received or due prior to the satisfaction of the performance obligations.  These contract liabilities primarily relate to upfront consideration received or due for equipment service plans, solar panel leases and the Illinois ZEC program that introduces a cap on the total consideration to be received by Generation. The Generation contract liability related to the Illinois ZEC program includes certain amounts with ComEd that are eliminated in consolidation in Exelon’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generation records contract liabilities within Other current liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities within Exelon’s and Generation’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The following table provides a rollforward of the contract assets and liabilities reflected in Exelon's and Generation's Consolidated Balance Sheets from January 1,


to

December 31, 2019

:

The Utility Registrants do not have any contract assets. The Utility Registrants also record contract liabilities when consideration is received prior to the satisfaction of the performance obligations. As of

December 31, 2019

and

December 31, 2018

, the Utility Registrants' contract liabilities were immaterial.

Transaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations (All Registrants)

The following table shows the amounts of future revenues expected to be recorded in each year for performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of

December 31, 2019

.  This disclosure only includes contracts for which the total consideration is fixed and determinable at contract inception.  The average contract term varies by customer type and commodity but ranges from one month to several years.

This disclosure excludes Generation’s power and gas sales contracts as they contain variable volumes and/or variable pricing.  This disclosure also excludes the Utility Registrants’ gas and electric tariff sales contracts and transmission revenue contracts as they generally have an original expected duration of one year or less and, therefore, do not contain any future, unsatisfied performance obligations to be included in this disclosure.

Segment Information

(All Registrants)

Operating segments for each of the Registrants are determined based on information used by the CODM in deciding how to evaluate performance and allocate resources at each of the Registrants.

Exelon has

eleven

reportable segments, which include Generation's

five

reportable segments consisting of the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York, ERCOT and all other power regions referred to collectively as “Other Power Regions” and ComEd, PECO, BGE, and PHI's

three

reportable segments consisting of Pepco, DPL, and ACE. ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE each represent a single reportable segment, and as such, no separate segment information is provided for these Registrants. Exelon, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE's CODMs evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE based on net income.

The basis for Generation's reportable segments is the integrated management of its electricity business that is located in different geographic regions, and largely representative of the footprints of ISO/RTO and/or NERC regions, which utilize multiple supply sources to provide electricity through various distribution channels (wholesale and retail). Generation's hedging strategies and risk metrics are also aligned to these same geographic regions. Descriptions of each of Generation’s

five

reportable segments are as follows:

•

Mid-Atlantic

represents operations in the eastern half of PJM, which includes New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Delaware, the District of Columbia and parts of Pennsylvania and North Carolina.

•

Midwest

represents operations in the western half of PJM and the United States footprint of MISO, excluding MISO’s Southern Region.

•

New York

represents operations within NYISO.

•

ERCOT

represents operations within Electric Reliability Council of Texas.

•

Other Power Regions:

•

New England

represents operations within ISO-NE.

•

South

represents operations in the FRCC, MISO’s Southern Region, the remaining portions of the SERC not included within MISO or PJM.

•

West

represents operations in the WECC, including California ISO.

•

Canada

represents operations across the entire country of Canada and includes AESO, OIESO and the Canadian portion of MISO.

The CODMs for Exelon and Generation evaluate the performance of Generation’s electric business activities and allocate resources based on RNF. Generation believes that RNF is a useful measurement of operational performance. RNF is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. Generation’s operating revenues include all sales to third parties and affiliated sales to the Utility Registrants. Purchased power costs include all costs associated with the procurement and supply of electricity including capacity, energy and ancillary services. Fuel expense includes the fuel costs for Generation’s owned generation and fuel costs associated with tolling agreements. The results of Generation's other business activities are not regularly reviewed by the CODM and are therefore not classified as operating segments or included in the regional reportable segment

(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)

Note 5 — Segment Information

amounts.  These activities include natural gas, as well as other miscellaneous business activities that are not significant to Generation's overall operating revenues or results of operations.  Further, Generation’s unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on economic hedging activities and its amortization of certain intangible assets and liabilities relating to commodity contracts recorded at fair value from mergers and acquisitions are also excluded from the regional reportable segment amounts. Exelon and Generation do not use a measure of total assets in making decisions regarding allocating resources to or assessing the performance of these reportable segments.

During the first quarter of 2019, due to a change in economics in our New England region, Generation changed the way that information is reviewed by the CODM. The New England region is no longer regularly reviewed as a separate region by the CODM nor is it presented separately in any external information presented to third parties. Information for the New England region is reviewed by the CODM as part of Other Power Regions. Exelon and Generation retrospectively applied this change.

The following tables disaggregate the Registrants' revenue recognized from contracts with customers into categories that depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. For Generation, the disaggregation of revenues reflects Generation's two primary products of power sales and natural gas sales, with further disaggregation of power sales provided by geographic region. For the Utility Registrants, the disaggregation of revenues reflects the two primary utility services of rate-regulated electric sales and rate-regulated natural gas sales (where applicable), with further disaggregation of these tariff sales provided by major customer groups. Exelon's disaggregated revenues are consistent with Generation and the Utility Registrants but exclude any intercompany revenues.

Early Plant Retirements

(Exelon and Generation)

Exelon and Generation continuously evaluate factors that affect the current and expected economic value of Generation’s plants, including, but not limited to: market power prices, results of capacity auctions, potential legislative and regulatory solutions to ensure plants are fairly compensated for benefits they provide through their carbon-free emissions, reliability, or fuel security, and the impact of potential rules from the EPA requiring reduction of carbon and other emissions and the efforts of states to implement those final rules. The precise timing of an early retirement date for any plant, and the resulting financial statement impacts, may be affected by many factors,



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)

Note 6 — Early Plant Retirements

including the status of potential regulatory or legislative solutions, results of any transmission system reliability study assessments, the nature of any co-owner requirements and stipulations, and NDT fund requirements for nuclear plants, among other factors. However, the earliest retirement date for any plant would usually be the first year in which the unit does not have capacity or other obligations, and where applicable, just prior to its next scheduled nuclear refueling outage.

Nuclear Generation

In 2015 and 2016, Generation identified the Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear plants in Illinois, Ginna and Nine Mile Point nuclear plants in New York and Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania as having the greatest risk of early retirement based on economic valuation and other factors. In 2017, PSEG made public similar financial challenges facing its New Jersey nuclear plants, including Salem, of which Generation owns a

42.59

%

ownership interest. PSEG is the operator of Salem and also has the decision-making authority to retire Salem.

Assuming the continued effectiveness of the Illinois ZES, New Jersey ZEC program and the New York CES, Generation and CENG, through its ownership of Ginna and Nine Mile Point, no longer consider Clinton, Quad Cities, Salem, Ginna or Nine Mile Point to be at heightened risk for early retirement. However, to the extent the Illinois ZES, New Jersey ZEC program or the New York CES do not operate as expected over their full terms, each of these plants could again be at heightened risk for early retirement, which could have a material impact on Exelon’s and Generation’s future financial statements. In addition, FERC’s December 19, 2019 order on the MOPR in PJM may undermine the continued effectiveness of the Illinois ZES and the New Jersey ZEC program unless Illinois and New Jersey implement an FRR mechanism under which the Generation plants in these states would be removed from PJM’s capacity auction. See

Note 3 — Regulatory Matters

for additional information on the Illinois ZES, New Jersey ZEC program, New York CES and FERC's December 19, 2019 order.

In Pennsylvania, the TMI nuclear plant did not clear in the May 2017 PJM capacity auction for the 2020-2021 planning year, the third consecutive year that TMI failed to clear the PJM base residual capacity auction and on May 30, 2017, based on these capacity auction results, prolonged periods of low wholesale power prices, and the absence of federal or state policies that place a value on nuclear energy for its ability to produce electricity without air pollution, Generation announced that it would permanently cease generation operations at TMI. On September 20, 2019, Generation permanently ceased generation operations at TMI.

On February 2, 2018, Generation announced that it would permanently cease generation operations at the Oyster Creek nuclear plant at the end of its current operating cycle and permanently ceased generation operations on September 17, 2018.



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)

Note 6 — Early Plant Retirements

As a result of these early nuclear plant retirement decisions, Exelon and Generation recognized incremental non-cash charges to earnings stemming from shortening the expected economic useful lives primarily related to accelerated depreciation of plant assets (including any ARC) and accelerated amortization of nuclear fuel, as well as operating and maintenance expenses. The total annual impact of these charges by year are summarized in the table below.

_________

(a)

Reflects incremental charges for TMI from January 1, 2019 through September 20, 2019.

(b)

Reflects incremental charges for TMI in 2018 and Oyster Creek from February 2, 2018 through September 17, 2018.

(c)

Reflects incremental charges for TMI from May 30, 2017 through December 31, 2017.

(d)

In 2019, primarily reflects the net impacts associated with the remeasurements of the TMI ARO in the first and third quarters. In 2018 and 2017, primarily reflects materials and supplies inventory reserve adjustments, employee related costs and CWIP impairments associated with the early retirement decisions for TMI and Oyster Creek. Excludes the charges in the third quarter of 2018 and second quarter of 2019 for the ARO remeasurement due to the sale of Oyster Creek. See

Note 2 — Mergers, Acquisitions and Dispositions

and

Note 9 — Asset Retirement Obligations

for additional information.

Generation’s Dresden, Byron, and Braidwood nuclear plants in Illinois are also showing increased signs of economic distress, which could lead to an early retirement, in a market that does not currently compensate them for their unique contribution to grid resiliency and their ability to produce large amounts of energy without carbon and air pollution. The May 2018 PJM capacity auction for the 2021-2022 planning year resulted in the largest volume of nuclear capacity ever not selected in the auction, including all of Dresden, and portions of Byron and Braidwood. Exelon continues to work with stakeholders on state policy solutions, while also advocating for broader market reforms at the regional and federal level.

Other Generation

On March 29, 2018, Generation notified grid operator ISO-NE of its plans to early retire Mystic Units 8 and 9 absent regulatory reforms on June 1, 2022, at the end of the then-current capacity commitment for Mystic Units 7 and 8. Mystic Unit 9 was then committed through May 2021.

On May 16, 2018, Generation made a filing with FERC to establish cost-of-service compensation and terms and conditions of service for Mystic Units 8 and 9 for the period between June 1, 2022 - May 31, 2024. On December 20, 2018, FERC issued an order accepting the cost of service compensation, reflecting a number of adjustments to the annual fixed revenue requirement and allowing for recovery of a substantial portion of the costs associated with the Everett Marine Terminal. Those adjustments were reflected in a compliance filing filed on March 1, 2019. In the December 20, 2018 order, FERC also directed a paper hearing on ROE using a new methodology. On January 22, 2019, Exelon and several other parties filed requests for rehearing of certain findings in the order.

On March 25, 2019, ISO-NE filed the Inventoried Energy Program, which is intended to provide an interim fuel security program pending conclusion of the stakeholder process to develop a long-term, market-based solution to address fuel security.  The Inventoried Energy Program went into effect on August 5, 2019. On October 7, 2019, requests for rehearing were denied and several parties have appealed to the D.C. Circuit Court. FERC ordered ISO-NE to file long-term, market-based fuel security rules by October 15, 2019; FERC has granted an extension to April 15, 2020.

The following table provides the balance sheet amounts as of

December 31, 2019

for Exelon's and Generation’s significant assets and liabilities associated with the Mystic Units 8 and 9 and Everett Marine Terminal assets that would potentially be impacted by the failure to adopt long-term solutions for reliability and fuel security.

Asset Retirement Obligations

(All Registrants)

Nuclear Decommissioning Asset Retirement Obligations (Exelon and Generation)

Generation has a legal obligation to decommission its nuclear power plants following the expiration of their operating licenses.  To estimate its decommissioning obligation related to its nuclear generating stations for financial accounting and reporting purposes, Generation uses a probability-weighted, discounted cash flow model which, on a unit-by-unit basis, considers multiple outcome scenarios that include significant estimates and assumptions, and are based on decommissioning cost studies, cost escalation rates, probabilistic cash flow models and discount rates.  Generation updates its ARO annually unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates, based on its review of updated cost studies and its annual evaluation of cost escalation factors and probabilities assigned to various scenarios.  Generation began decommissioning the TMI nuclear plant upon permanently ceasing operations in 2019. See below section for decommissioning of Zion Station.

The financial statement impact for changes in the ARO, on an individual unit basis, due to the changes in and timing of estimated cash flows generally result in a corresponding change in the unit’s ARC within Property, plant and equipment on Exelon’s and Generation’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the ARO decreases for a Non-Regulatory Agreement unit without any remaining ARC, the corresponding change is recorded as decrease in Operating and maintenance expense within Exelon’s and Generation’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

The following table provides a rollforward of the nuclear decommissioning ARO reflected in Exelon’s and Generation’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, from January 1,


to

December 31, 2019

:

__________

(a)

Includes

$


million

and

$


million

as the current portion of the ARO at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively, which is included in Other current liabilities in Exelon’s and Generation’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(b)

Includes

$


million

of ARO related to Oyster Creek which is classified as Liabilities held for sale in Exelon's and Generation's Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2018. See Note

Mergers, Acquisitions and Dispositions

for additional information.

The net

$


million

increase in the ARO during 2019 for changes in the amounts and timing of estimated decommissioning cash flows was driven by multiple adjustments throughout the year, some with offsetting impacts. These adjustments primarily include:

•

An increase of approximately

$


million

for changes in the assumed retirement timing probabilities for sites including certain economically challenged nuclear plants and the extension of Peach Bottom’s operating life; and

•

An increase of approximately

$


million

for other impacts that included updated cost escalation rates, primarily for labor, equipment and materials, and current discount rates; partially offset by

•

Lower estimated costs to decommission TMI, Nine Mile Point, Ginna, Braidwood, Byron and LaSalle nuclear units of approximately

$


million

resulting from the completion of updated cost studies.

decrease in the ARO during 2018 for changes in the amounts and timing of estimated decommissioning cash flows was driven by multiple adjustments throughout the year, some with offsetting impacts. These adjustments primarily include:

•

A decrease of approximately

$


million

primarily due to lower estimated costs for the construction of interim spent fuel storage at TMI and a net decrease in estimated costs to decommission Calvert Cliffs, FitzPatrick, Limerick, and Salem nuclear units resulting from the completion of updated cost studies. There was also a decrease due to changes in decommissioning scenarios and their probabilities. These decreases were partially offset by

•

An increase of approximately

$


million

for the impact of the early retirement and the announced pending sale of Oyster Creek which closed on July 1, 2019; and

NDT Funds

NDT funds have been established for each generation station unit to satisfy Generation’s nuclear decommissioning obligations.  Generally, NDT funds established for a particular unit may not be used to fund the decommissioning obligations of any other unit.

The NDT funds associated with Generation's nuclear units have been funded with amounts collected from the previous owners and their respective utility customers. PECO is authorized to collect funds, in revenues, for decommissioning the former PECO nuclear plants through regulated rates, and these collections are scheduled through the operating lives of the former PECO plants. The amounts collected from PECO customers are remitted to Generation and deposited into the NDT funds for the unit for which funds are collected. Every five years, PECO files a rate adjustment with the PAPUC that reflects PECO’s calculations of the estimated amount needed to decommission each of the former PECO units based on updated fund balances and estimated decommissioning costs.  The rate adjustment is used to determine the amount collectible from PECO customers.  On March 31, 2017, PECO filed its Nuclear Decommissioning Cost Adjustment with the PAPUC proposing an annual recovery from customers of approximately

$


million

. This amount reflects a decrease from the previously approved annual collection of approximately

$


million

primarily due to the removal of the collections for Limerick Units 1 and 2 as a result of the NRC approving the extension of the operating licenses for an additional


years.  On August 8, 2017, the PAPUC approved the filing and the new rates became effective January 1, 2018.

Any shortfall of funds necessary for decommissioning, determined for each generating station unit, is ultimately required to be funded by Generation, with the exception of a shortfall for the current decommissioning activities at Zion Station, where certain decommissioning activities have been transferred to a third-party (see Zion Station Decommissioning below) and the CENG units, where any shortfall is required to be funded by both Generation and EDF.  Generation, through PECO, has recourse to collect additional amounts from PECO customers related to a shortfall of NDT funds for the former PECO units, subject to certain limitations and thresholds, as prescribed by an order from the PAPUC.  Generally, PECO, and likewise Generation will not be allowed to collect amounts associated with the first

$


million

of any shortfall of trust funds compared to decommissioning costs, as well as


%

of any additional shortfalls, on an aggregate basis for all former PECO units.  The initial

$


million

and up to


%

of any additional shortfalls would be borne by Generation.  No recourse exists to collect additional amounts from utility customers for any of Generation's other nuclear units.  With respect to the former ComEd and PECO units, any funds remaining in the NDTs after all decommissioning has been completed are required to be refunded to ComEd’s or PECO’s customers, subject to certain limitations that allow sharing of excess funds with Generation related to the former PECO units.  With respect to Generation's other nuclear units, Generation retains any funds remaining after decommissioning.  However, in connection with CENG's acquisition of the Nine Mile Point and Ginna plants



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)

Note 9 — Asset Retirement Obligations

and settlements with certain regulatory agencies, CENG is subject to certain conditions pertaining to NDT funds that, if met, could possibly result in obligations to make payments to certain third parties (clawbacks).  For Nine Mile Point and Ginna, the clawback provisions are triggered only in the event that the required decommissioning activities are discontinued or not started or completed in a timely manner.  In the event that the clawback provisions are triggered for Nine Mile Point, then, depending upon the triggering event, an amount equal to


%

of the total amount withdrawn from the funds for non-decommissioning activities or


%

of any excess funds in the trust funds above the amounts required for decommissioning (including spent fuel management and decommissioning) is to be paid to the Nine Mile Point sellers.  In the event that the clawback provisions are triggered for Ginna, then an amount equal to any estimated cost savings realized by not completing any of the required decommissioning activities is to be paid to the Ginna sellers.  Generation expects to comply with applicable regulations and timely commence and complete all required decommissioning activities.

At

December 31, 2019

and


, Exelon and Generation had NDT funds totaling

$

13,353

million

and

$

12,695

million

, respectively. The NDT funds included

$


million

at December 31, 2018, related to Oyster Creek NDT funds which were classified as Assets held for sale in Exelon's and Generation's Consolidated Balance Sheets. See

Note 2 — Mergers, Acquisitions and Dispositions

for additional information. The NDT funds include

$


million

and

$


million

for the current portion of the NDT at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively, which are included in Other current assets in Exelon's and Generation's Consolidated Balance Sheets. See

Note 23 — Supplemental Financial Information

for additional information on activities of the NDT funds.

Accounting Implications of the Regulatory Agreements with ComEd and PECO

Based on the regulatory agreements with the ICC and PAPUC that dictate Generation’s obligations related to the shortfall or excess of NDT funds necessary for decommissioning the former ComEd units on a unit-by-unit basis and the former PECO units in total, decommissioning-related activities net of applicable taxes, including realized and unrealized gains and losses on the NDT funds and accretion of the decommissioning obligation, are generally offset within Exelon’s and Generation’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. For the former ComEd units, decommissioning-related activities are generally offset within Exelon’s and Generation’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income as long as the NDT funds are expected to exceed the total estimated decommissioning obligation.  For the former PECO units, decommissioning-related activities are generally offset within Exelon’s and Generation’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income regardless of whether the NDT funds are expected to exceed or fall short of the total estimated decommissioning obligation. The offset of decommissioning-related activities within the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income results in an equal adjustment to the noncurrent payables to affiliates at Generation.  ComEd and PECO have recorded an equal noncurrent affiliate receivable from Generation and corresponding regulatory liability.

Should the expected value of the NDT fund for any former ComEd unit fall below the amount of the expected decommissioning obligation for that unit, the accounting to offset decommissioning-related activities in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income for that unit would be discontinued, the decommissioning-related activities would be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and the adverse impact to Exelon’s and Generation’s financial statements could be material.  As of

December 31, 2019

, the NDT funds of each of the former ComEd units, except for Zion (see Zion Station Decommissioning below), are expected to exceed the related decommissioning obligation for each of the units.  For the purposes of making this determination, the decommissioning obligation referred to is different, as described below, from the calculation used in the NRC minimum funding obligation filings based on NRC guidelines.

Any changes to the PECO regulatory agreements could impact Exelon’s and Generation’s ability to offset decommissioning-related activities within the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income, and the impact to Exelon’s and Generation’s financial statements could be material.

The decommissioning-related activities related to the Non-Regulatory Agreement Units are reflected in Exelon’s and Generation’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

Note 3 — Regulatory Matters

and

Note 24 — Related Party Transactions

for additional information regarding regulatory liabilities at ComEd and PECO and intercompany balances between Generation, ComEd and PECO reflecting the obligation to refund to customers any decommissioning-related assets in excess of the related decommissioning obligations.

Note 9 — Asset Retirement Obligations

Zion Station Decommissioning

In 2010, Generation completed an Asset Sale Agreement (ASA) under which ZionSolutions assumed responsibility for decommissioning Zion Station and Generation transferred to ZionSolutions substantially all the Zion Station’s assets, including the related NDT funds.  To reduce the risk of default by ZionSolutions, EnergySolutions has provided a

$


million

letter of credit to be used to fund decommissioning costs in the event the NDT assets are insufficient. EnergySolutions and its parent company have also provided a performance guarantee.

Following ZionSolutions' completion of its contractual obligations and transfer of the NRC license to Generation, Generation will store the SNF at Zion Station until it is transferred to the DOE for ultimate disposal, and will complete all remaining decommissioning activities associated with the SNF dry storage facility.

Generation had retained its obligation for the SNF as well as certain NDT assets to fund its obligation to maintain the SNF at Zion Station until transfer to the DOE and to complete all remaining decommissioning activities for the SNF storage facility. Any shortage of funds necessary to maintain the SNF and decommission the SNF storage facility is ultimately required to be funded by Generation.  Any Zion Station NDT funds remaining after the completion of all decommissioning activities will be returned to ComEd customers in accordance with the applicable orders.

NRC Minimum Funding Requirements

NRC regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that funds will be available in specified minimum amounts to decommission the facility at the end of its life. The estimated decommissioning obligations as calculated using the NRC methodology differ from the ARO recorded in Generation’s and Exelon’s Consolidated Balance Sheets primarily due to differences in the type of costs included in the estimates, the basis for estimating such costs, and assumptions regarding the decommissioning alternatives to be used, potential license renewals, decommissioning cost escalation, and the growth rate in the NDT funds. Under NRC regulations, if the minimum funding requirements calculated under the NRC methodology are less than the future value of the NDT funds, also calculated under the NRC methodology, then the NRC requires either further funding or other financial guarantees.

Key assumptions used in the minimum funding calculation using the NRC methodology at

December 31, 2019

include: (1) consideration of costs only for the removal of radiological contamination at each unit; (2) the option on a unit-by-unit basis to use generic, non-site specific cost estimates; (3) consideration of only one decommissioning scenario for each unit; (4) the plants cease operation at the end of their current license lives (with no assumed license renewals for those units that have not already received renewals); (5) the assumption of current nominal dollar cost estimates that are neither escalated through the anticipated period of decommissioning, nor discounted using the CARFR; and (6) assumed annual after-tax returns on the NDT funds of


%

(


%

for the former PECO units, as specified by the PAPUC).

In contrast, the key criteria and assumptions used by Generation to determine the ARO and to forecast the target growth in the NDT funds at

December 31, 2019

include: (1) the use of site specific cost estimates that are updated at least once every five years; (2) the inclusion in the ARO estimate of all legally unavoidable costs required to decommission the unit (e.g., radiological decommissioning and full site restoration for certain units, on-site spent fuel maintenance and storage subsequent to ceasing operations and until DOE acceptance, and disposal of certain low-level radioactive waste); (3) the consideration of multiple scenarios where decommissioning and site restoration activities, as applicable, are completed under possible scenarios ranging from


to


years after the cessation of plant operations; (4) the consideration of multiple end of life scenarios; (5) the measurement of the obligation at the present value of the future estimated costs and an annual average accretion of the ARO of approximately


%

through a period of approximately


years after the end of the extended lives of the units; and (6) an estimated targeted annual pre-tax return on the NDT funds of

5.4

%

to

6.5

%

(as compared to a historical 5-year annual average pre-tax return of approximately

6.7

%

).

Generation is required to provide to the NRC a biennial report by unit (annually for units that have been retired or are within five years of the current approved license life), based on values as of December 31, addressing Generation’s ability to meet the NRC minimum funding levels.  Depending on the value of the trust funds, Generation may be required to take steps, such as providing financial guarantees through letters of credit or parent company guarantees or making additional contributions to the trusts, which could be significant, to ensure that the trusts are adequately funded and that NRC minimum funding requirements are met.  As a result, Exelon’s and Generation’s cash flows and financial positions may be significantly adversely affected.

Note 9 — Asset Retirement Obligations

Generation filed its biennial decommissioning funding status report with the NRC on April 1, 2019 for all units except for Zion Station which is included in a separate report to the NRC submitted by ZionSolutions, LLC. The status report demonstrated adequate decommissioning funding assurance as of December 31, 2018 for all units except for Clinton and Peach Bottom Unit 1. As of February 28, 2019, Clinton demonstrated adequate minimum funding assurance due to market recovery and no further action is required. This demonstration was also included in the April 1, 2019 submittal. As a former PECO plant, financial assurance for decommissioning Peach Bottom Unit 1 is provided by the NDT fund, collections from PECO ratepayers and the ability to adjust those collections in accordance with the approved PAPUC tariff. No additional actions are required aside from the PAPUC filing in accordance with the tariff. See NDT Funds section above for additional information.

Generation will file its next annual decommissioning funding status report with the NRC by March 31, 2020 for shutdown reactors, reactors within five years of shutdown except for Zion Station which is included in a separate report to the NRC submitted by EnergySolutions (see Zion Station Decommissioning above). This report will reflect the status of decommissioning funding assurance as of December 31, 2019 and will include an update for the retirement of TMI in 2019.   A shortfall at any unit could necessitate that Exelon post a parental guarantee for Generation's share of the funding assurance. However, the amount of any required guarantee will ultimately depend on the decommissioning approach adopted, the associated level of costs, and the decommissioning trust fund investment performance going forward.

As the future values of trust funds change due to market conditions, the NRC minimum funding status of Generation’s units will change. In addition, if changes occur to the regulatory agreement with the PAPUC that currently allows amounts to be collected from PECO customers for decommissioning the former PECO units, the NRC minimum funding status of those plants could change at subsequent NRC filing dates.

Non-Nuclear Asset Retirement Obligations (All Registrants)

Generation has AROs for plant closure costs associated with its fossil and renewable generating facilities, including asbestos abatement, removal of certain storage tanks, restoring leased land to the condition it was in prior to construction of renewable generating stations and other decommissioning-related activities. The Utility Registrants have AROs primarily associated with the abatement and disposal of equipment and buildings contaminated with asbestos and PCBs. See

Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies

for additional information on the Registrants’ accounting policy for AROs.

Asset Impairments

(Exelon, Generation and PHI)

The Registrants evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. Indicators of impairment may include a deteriorating business climate, including, but not limited to, declines in energy prices, condition of the asset, specific regulatory disallowance, or plans to dispose of a long-lived asset significantly before the end of its useful life. The Registrants determine if long-lived assets or asset groups are impaired by comparing the undiscounted expected future cash flows to the carrying value. When the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group over its fair value. The fair value analysis is primarily based on the income approach using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) including revenue and generation forecasts, projected capital and maintenance expenditures and discount rates. A variation in the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the recoverability of an asset or asset group and, thus, could potentially result in material future impairments of the Registrant's long-lived assets.

Equity Method Investments in Certain Distributed Energy Companies

(Exelon and Generation)

In the third quarter of 2019, Generation’s equity method investments in certain distributed energy companies were fully impaired due to an other-than-temporary decline in market conditions and underperforming projects. Exelon and Generation recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of

$


million

in Equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates and an offsetting pre-tax

$


million

in Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in their Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. As a result, Generation accelerated the amortization of investment tax credits associated with these companies and Exelon and Generation recorded a benefit of

$


million

in Income taxes. The impairment charge and the accelerated amortization of investment tax credits resulted in a net

$


million

decrease to Exelon’s and Generation’s earnings. See

Note 22 — Variable Interest Entities

for additional information.

Antelope Valley Solar Facility

(Exelon and Generation)

Generation’s Antelope Valley, a


MW solar facility in Lancaster, CA, sells all of its output to PG&E through a PPA. As of

December 31, 2019

, Generation had approximately

$


million

of net long-lived assets related to Antelope Valley. As a result of the PG

&E bankruptcy filing in the first quarter of 2019, Generation completed a comprehensive review of Antelope Valley's estimated undiscounted future cash flows and no impairment charge was recorded. Significant changes in assumptions such as the likelihood of the PPA being rejected as part of the ba

nkruptcy proceedings could potentially result in future impairments of Antelope Valley’s net long-lived assets, which could be material.

Antelope Valley is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of EGR IV, which had approximately

$

1,893

million

of additional net long-lived assets as of

December 31, 2019

. EGR IV is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Exelon and Generation and includes Generation's interest in EGRP and other projects with non-controlling interests. To date, there have been no indicators to suggest that the carrying amount of other net long-lived assets of EGR IV may not be recoverable.

Generation will continue to monitor the bankruptcy proceedings for any changes in circumstances that may indicate the carrying amount of the net long-lived assets of Antelope Valley or other long-lived assets of EGR IV may not be recoverable.

See

Note 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements

for additional information on the PG&E bankruptcy.

New England Asset Group (Exelon and Generation)

During the first quarter of 2018, Mystic Unit 9 did not clear in the ISO-NE capacity auction for the 2021 - 2022 planning year. On March 29, 2018, Generation notified ISO-NE of the early retirement of its Mystic Generating Station's Units 7, 8, 9 and the Mystic Jet Unit (Mystic Generating Station assets) absent regulatory reforms. These events suggested that the carrying value of its New England asset group may be impaired. Generation completed a comprehensive review of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the New England asset group and no impairment charge was required. Further developments such as the failure of ISO-NE to adopt long-term solutions for reliability and fuel security could potentially result in material future impairments of the New England asset group. See

Note 6 — Early Plant Retirements

for additional information.

District of Columbia Sponsorship (Exelon and PHI)

In the third quarter of 2015, PHI entered into a sponsorship agreement with the District of Columbia for future sponsorship rights associated with public property within the District of Columbia, which Exelon and PHI had recorded as a finite-lived intangible asset as of December 31, 2016. The specific sponsorship rights were to be determined through future negotiations.  In the fourth quarter of 2017, based upon the lack of available sponsorship opportunities at that time, the asset was written off and a pre-tax impairment charge of

$


million

was recorded within Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon’s and PHI's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

ExGen Texas Power (Exelon and Generation)

On May 2, 2017, EGTP entered into a consent agreement with its lenders to initiate the sale of the assets of its wholly owned subsidiaries. As a result, Exelon and Generation classified certain of EGTP's assets and liabilities as held for sale at their respective fair values less costs to sell and recorded a pre-tax impairment charge in 2017 of

$


million

within Operating and maintenance expense in their Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. On November 7, 2017, EGTP and its wholly owned subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware and, as a result, Exelon and Generation deconsolidated EGTP's assets and liabilities from their consolidated financial statements.

Reflects goodwill recorded in 2016 from the PHI merger.

Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an assessment for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of ComEd's and PHI's reporting units below their carrying amounts. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (known as a component) and is the level at which goodwill is tested for impairment. A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and its operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management. ComEd has a single operating segment. PHI's operating segments are Pepco, DPL and ACE. See Note


—

Segment Information

for additional information. There is no level below these operating segments for which operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management. Therefore, the ComEd, Pepco, DPL and ACE operating segments are also considered reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes. Exelon's and ComEd's $2.6 billion of goodwill has been assigned entirely to the ComEd reporting unit, while Exelon's and PHI's $4.0 billion of goodwill has been assigned to the Pepco, DPL and ACE reporting units in the amounts of

$

2.1

billion

,

$

1.4

billion

and

$

0.5

billion

, respectively.

Entities assessing goodwill for impairment have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary. As part of the qualitative assessments, Exelon, ComEd and PHI evaluate, among other things, management's best estimate of projected operating and capital cash flows for their businesses, outcomes of recent regulatory proceedings, changes in certain market conditions, including the discount rate and regulated utility peer EBITDA multiples, and the passing margin from their last quantitative assessments

performed. If an entity bypasses the qualitative assessment, a quantitative two-step, fair value-based test is performed. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed. The second step requires an allocation of fair value to the individual assets and liabilities using purchase price allocation authoritative guidance in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill.

Application of the goodwill impairment test requires management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of the reporting unit, which management estimates using a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market multiples analysis. Significant assumptions used in these fair value analyses include discount and growth rates, utility sector market performance and transactions, projected operating and capital cash flows for ComEd's, Pepco's, DPL's and ACE's businesses and the fair value of debt. In applying the second step, if needed, management must estimate the fair value of specific assets and liabilities of the reporting unit.


and


Goodwill Impairment Assessment.

ComEd and PHI qualitatively determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of their reporting units exceeded their carrying values and, therefore, did not perform quantitative assessments as of November 1, 2019 and 2018 for ComEd and as of November 1, 2019 for PHI. The last quantitative assessments performed were as of November 1, 2016 for ComEd and November 1, 2018 for PHI.

PHI performed a quantitative test for its 2018 annual goodwill impairment assessment as of November 1, 2018. The first step of the test comparing the estimated fair values of the Pepco, DPL and ACE reporting units to their carrying values, including goodwill, indicated no impairments of goodwill; therefore, no second step was required.

While the annual assessments indicated no impairments, certain assumptions used to estimate reporting unit fair values are highly sensitive to changes. Adverse regulatory actions or changes in significant assumptions

could potentially result in future impairments of Exelon's, ComEd's and PHI’s goodwill, which could be material. Based on the results of the last quantitative goodwill test performed, the estimated fair values of the ComEd, Pepco, DPL and ACE reporting units would have needed to decrease by more than

Renewable Energy Credits (Exelon and Generation)

Exelon’s and Generation’s RECs are included in Other current assets and Other deferred debits and other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Purchased RECs are recorded at cost on the date they are purchased. The cost of RECs purchased on a stand-alone basis is based on the transaction price, while the cost of RECs acquired through PPAs represents the difference between the total contract price and the market price of energy at contract inception. Generally, revenue for RECs that are sold to a counterparty under a contract that specifically identifies a power plant is recognized at a point in time when the power is produced. This includes both bundled and unbundled REC sales. Otherwise, the revenue is recognized upon physical transfer of the REC to the customer.

The following table presents changes in unrecognized tax benefits, by Registrant.



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)

Note 13 — Income Taxes

__________

(a)

Exelon established a liability for an uncertain tax position associated with the tax deductibility of certain merger commitments incurred by Exelon in connection with the acquisitions of Constellation and PHI. In 2017, as a part of its examination of Exelon's return, the IRS National Office issued guidance concurring with Exelon's position that the merger commitments were deductible. As a result, Exelon, Generation, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE decreased their liability for unrecognized tax benefits by

$


million

,

$


million

,

$


million

,

$


million

,

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, resulting in a benefit to Income taxes on Exelon's, Generation's, PHI's, Pepco's, DPL's, and ACE's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and corresponding decreases in their effective tax rates.

(b)

Exelon, Generation, BGE, PHI, Pepco, and DPL decreased their unrecognized state tax benefits primarily due to the receipt of favorable guidance with respect to the deductibility of certain depreciable fixed assets. The recognition of the tax benefits related to BGE, PHI, Pepco, and DPL was offset by corresponding regulatory liabilities and that portion had no immediate impact to their effective tax rate.

Like-Kind Exchange

In 2016, the Tax Court held that Exelon was not entitled to defer a gain on its 1999 like-kind exchange transaction. In addition to the tax and interest related to the gain deferral, the Tax Court also ruled that Exelon was liable for penalties and interest on the penalties. Exelon had fully paid the amounts assessed resulting from the Tax Court decision in 2017. In September 2017, Exelon appealed the Tax Court decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. In October 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the Tax Court’s decision. Exelon filed a petition seeking rehearing of the Seventh Circuit’s decision, but the Seventh Circuit denied that petition in December 2018.  In the first quarter of 2019, Exelon elected not to seek a further review by the U.S. Supreme

State Income Tax Law Changes

Illinois

- On June 5, 2019, the Governor of Illinois signed a tax bill which would increase the Illinois corporate income tax rate from

9.50

%

to

10.49

%

effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2021. The tax rate is contingent upon ratification of state constitutional amendments in November 2020. The effect of the rate change will be recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted. Exelon, Generation and ComEd do not expect a material impact to their financial statements as a result of the rate change.

In 2017, Exelon reviewed and updated its marginal state income tax rates based on 2016 state apportionment rates. In addition, Exelon, Generation and ComEd recorded the impacts of Illinois’ statutory rate change, which increased the total corporate income tax rate from

7.75

%

to

9.50

%

effective July 1, 2017.

The following table provides the one-time impact of the rate changes in 2017 for Exelon, Generation and ComEd:

Long-Term Marginal State Income Tax Rate (All Registrants)

Quarterly, Exelon reviews and updates its marginal state income tax rates for changes in state apportionment.  The Registrants remeasure their existing deferred income tax balances to reflect the changes in marginal rates, which results in either an increase or decrease to their net deferred income tax liability balances. Utility Registrants record corresponding regulatory liabilities or assets to the extent such amounts are probable of settlement or recovery through customer rates and an adjustment to income tax expense for all other amounts.

There were no material adjustments to income tax expense in 2017 as a result of changes in state apportionment.

Allocation of Tax Benefits (All Registrants)

Generation and the Utility Registrants are all party to an agreement with Exelon and other subsidiaries of Exelon that provides for the allocation of consolidated tax liabilities and benefits (Tax Sharing Agreement). The Tax Sharing Agreement provides that each party is allocated an amount of tax similar to that which would be owed had the party been separately subject to tax. In addition, any net benefit attributable to Exelon is reallocated to the other Registrants. That allocation is treated as a contribution to the capital of the party receiving the benefit.

The following table presents the allocation of federal tax benefits from Exelon under the Tax Sharing Agreement.

__________

(a)

ACE did not record an allocation of federal tax benefits from Exelon under the Tax Sharing Agreement as a result of a tax net operating loss.

(b)

Retirement Benefits

(All Registrants)

Exelon sponsors defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans for essentially all current employees.  Substantially all non-union employees and electing union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001 participate in cash balance pension plans. Effective January 1, 2009, substantially all newly-hired union-represented employees participate in cash balance pension plans.  Effective February 1, 2018, most newly-hired Generation and BSC non-represented, non-craft, employees are not eligible for pension benefits, and will instead be eligible to receive an enhanced non-discretionary employer contribution in an Exelon defined contribution savings plan.  Effective January 1, 2018, most newly-hired non-represented, non-craft, employees are not eligible for OPEB benefits and employees represented by Local 614 are not eligible for retiree health care benefits.

Effective January 1, 2019, Exelon merged the Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan (CBPP) into the Exelon Corporation Retirement Program (ECRP). The merging of the plans did not change the benefits offered to the plan participants and, thus, had no impact on Exelon's pension obligation. However, beginning in 2019, actuarial losses and gains related to the CBPP and ECRP are amortized over participants’ average remaining service period of the merged ECRP rather than each individual plan.

Cost Allocation to Exelon Subsidiaries

All Registrants account for their participation in Exelon’s pension and OPEB plans by applying multi-employer accounting. Exelon allocates costs related to its pension and OPEB plans to its subsidiaries based on both active and retired employee participation in each plan.

The amounts below represent the Registrants’ allocated pension and OPEB costs. As a result of new pension guidance effective on January 1, 2018, certain balances have been reclassified on Exelon’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2017.  For Exelon, the service cost component is included in Operating and maintenance expense and Property, plant and equipment, net, while the non–service cost components are included in Other, net and Regulatory assets for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 and in Other, net and Property, plant and equipment, net, for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Exelon recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and OPEB plans as an asset or liability on its balance sheet, with offsetting entries to AOCI and regulatory assets (liabilities). A portion of current year actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs (credits) is capitalized within Exelon’s Consolidated Balance Sheets to reflect the expected regulatory recovery of these amounts, which would otherwise be recorded to AOCI.

Average Remaining Service Period

For pension benefits, Exelon amortizes its unrecognized prior service costs and certain actuarial gains and losses, as applicable, based on participants’ average remaining service periods.

For OPEB, Exelon amortizes its unrecognized prior service costs over participants’ average remaining service period to benefit eligibility age and amortizes certain actuarial gains and losses over participants’ average remaining service period to expected retirement. The resulting average remaining service periods for pension and OPEB were as follows:

Assumptions

The measurement of the plan obligations and costs of providing benefits under Exelon’s defined benefit and other postretirement plans involves various factors, including the development of valuation assumptions and inputs and accounting policy elections. The measurement of benefit obligations and costs is impacted by several assumptions and inputs, as shown below, among other factors. When developing the required assumptions, Exelon considers historical information as well as future expectations.

Expected Rate of Return.

In selecting the EROA, Exelon considers historical economic indicators (including inflation and GDP growth) that impact asset returns, as well as expectations regarding future long-term capital market performance, weighted by Exelon’s target asset class allocations.

Mortality

.  The mortality assumption is composed of a base table that represents the current expectation of life expectancy of the population adjusted by an improvement scale that attempts to anticipate future improvements in life expectancy. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Exelon’s mortality assumption was supported by an actuarial experience study of Exelon's plan participants and utilized the IRS's RP–2000 base table projected to 2012 with improvement scale AA and projected thereafter with generational improvement scale BB two-dimensional adjusted to a

0.75

%

long-term rate reached in 2027. For the year ended December 31, 2019, Exelon's mortality assumption utilizes the Society of Actuaries' 2019 base table (Pri-2012) and MP-


improvement scale adjusted to a

0.75

%

long-term rate reached in 2035.

For Exelon, the following assumptions were used to determine the benefit obligations for the plans at

December 31, 2019

and


. Assumptions used to determine year-end benefit obligations are the assumptions used to estimate the subsequent year’s net periodic benefit costs.

Management considers various factors when making pension funding decisions, including actuarially determined minimum contribution requirements under ERISA, contributions required to avoid benefit restrictions and at-risk status as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Act), management of the pension obligation and regulatory implications. The Act requires the attainment of certain funding levels to avoid benefit restrictions (such as an inability to pay lump sums or to accrue benefits prospectively), and at-risk status (which triggers higher minimum contribution requirements and participant notification).  The projected contributions below reflect a funding strategy to make levelized annual contributions with the objective of achieving 100% funded status on an ABO basis over time. This level funding strategy helps minimize volatility of future period required pension contributions. Based on this funding strategy and current market conditions, which are subject to change, Exelon’s estimated annual qualified pension contributions will be approximately

$


million

beginning in 2020. Unlike the qualified pension plans, Exelon’s non-qualified pension plans are not funded, given that they are not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements.

While other postretirement plans are also not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements, Exelon does fund certain of its plans.  For Exelon's funded OPEB plans, contributions generally equal accounting costs, however, Exelon’s management has historically considered several factors in determining the level of contributions to its OPEB plans, including liabilities management, levels of benefit claims paid and regulatory implications (amounts deemed prudent to meet regulatory expectations and best assure continued rate recovery).  The amounts below include benefit payments related to unfunded plans.

Plan Assets

Investment Strategy.

On a regular basis, Exelon evaluates its investment strategy to ensure that plan assets will be sufficient to pay plan benefits when due. As part of this ongoing evaluation, Exelon may make changes to its targeted asset allocation and investment strategy.

Exelon has developed and implemented a liability hedging investment strategy for its qualified pension plans that has reduced the volatility of its pension assets relative to its pension liabilities. Exelon is likely to continue to gradually increase the liability hedging portfolio as the funded status of its plans improves. The overall objective is to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns that will balance the liquidity requirements of the plans’ liabilities while striving to minimize the risk of significant losses. Trust assets for Exelon’s other postretirement plans are managed in a diversified investment strategy that prioritizes maximizing liquidity and returns while minimizing asset volatility.

Actual asset returns have an impact on the costs reported for the Exelon-sponsored pension and OPEB plans. The actual asset returns across Exelon’s pension and OPEB plans for the year ended

December 31, 2019

were

18.80

%

and

Valuation Techniques Used to Determine Fair Value

The techniques used to fair value the pension and OPEB assets invested in cash equivalents, equities, fixed income, derivatives, private equity, real estate, and private credit investments are the same as the valuation techniques for these types of investments in NDTFs. See Cash Equivalents and NDT Fund Investments in Note

Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities

for further information.

Pension and OPEB assets also include investments in hedge funds. Hedge fund investments include those seeking to maximize absolute returns using a broad range of strategies to enhance returns and provide additional diversification. The fair value of hedge funds is determined using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient, and therefore, hedge funds are not classified within the fair value hierarchy.  Exelon has the ability to redeem these investments at NAV or its equivalent subject to certain restrictions which may include a lock-up period or a gate.

Defined Contribution Savings Plan (All Registrants)

The Registrants participate in various 401(k) defined contribution savings plans that are sponsored by Exelon. The plans are qualified under applicable sections of the IRC and allow employees to contribute a portion of their pre-tax and/or after-tax income in accordance with specified guidelines. All Registrants match a percentage of the employee contributions up to certain limits.

Derivative Financial Instruments

(All Registrants)

The Registrants use derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk related to ongoing business operations.

Authoritative guidance requires that derivative instruments be recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value, with changes in fair value of the derivative recognized in earnings immediately. Other accounting treatments are



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)

Note 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments

available through special election and designation, provided they meet specific, restrictive criteria both at the time of designation and on an ongoing basis. These alternative permissible accounting treatments include NPNS, cash flow hedges and fair value hedges. All derivative economic hedges related to commodities, referred to as economic hedges, are recorded at fair value through earnings at Generation and are offset by a corresponding regulatory asset or liability at ComEd. For all NPNS derivative instruments, accounts receivable or accounts payable are recorded when derivative settles and revenue or expense is recognized in earnings as the underlying physical commodity is sold or consumed.

Authoritative guidance about offsetting assets and liabilities requires the fair value of derivative instruments to be shown in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on a gross basis, even when the derivative instruments are subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements and qualify for net presentation in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A master netting agreement is an agreement between two counterparties that may have derivative and non-derivative contracts with each other providing for the net settlement of all referencing contracts via one payment stream, which takes place as the contracts deliver, when collateral is requested or in the event of default. In the tables below that present fair value balances, Generation’s energy-related economic hedges and proprietary trading derivatives are shown gross. The impact of the netting of fair value balances with the same counterparty that are subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements, as well as netting of cash collateral, including margin on exchange positions, is aggregated in the collateral and netting columns.

Generation’s and ComEd’s use of cash collateral is generally unrestricted unless Generation or ComEd are downgraded below investment grade. Cash collateral held by PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL and ACE must be deposited in an unaffiliated major U.S. commercial bank or foreign bank with a U.S. branch office that meet certain qualifications.

Commodity Price Risk (All Registrants)

Each of the Registrants employ established policies and procedures to manage their risks associated with market fluctuations in commodity prices by entering into physical and financial derivative contracts, including swaps, futures, forwards, options and short-term and long-term commitments to purchase and sell energy and commodity products. The Registrants believe these instruments, which are either determined to be non-derivative or classified as economic hedges, mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices.

Generation.

To the extent the amount of energy Generation produces differs from the amount of energy it has contracted to sell, Exelon and Generation are exposed to market fluctuations in the prices of electricity, fossil fuels and other commodities. Within Exelon, Generation has the most exposure to commodity price risk. As such, Generation uses a variety of derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage the commodity price risk of its electric generation facilities, including power and gas sales, fuel and power purchases, natural gas transportation and pipeline capacity agreements and other energy-related products marketed and purchased. To manage these risks, Generation may enter into fixed-price derivative or non-derivative contracts to hedge the variability in future cash flows from expected sales of power and gas and purchases of power and fuel. The objectives for executing such hedges include fixing the price for a portion of anticipated future electricity sales at a level that provides an acceptable return. Generation is also exposed to differences between the locational settlement prices of certain economic hedges and the hedged generating units. This price difference is actively managed through other instruments which include derivative congestion products, whose changes in fair value are recognized in earnings each period, and auction revenue rights, which are accounted for on an accrual basis.

Additionally, Generation is exposed to certain market risks through its proprietary trading activities. The proprietary trading activities are a complement to Generation’s energy marketing portfolio but represent a small portion of Generation’s overall energy marketing activities and are subject to limits established by Exelon’s RMC.

Utility Registrants.

The Utility Registrants procure electric and natural gas supply through a competitive procurement process approved by each of the respective state utility commissions. The Utility Registrants’ hedging programs are intended to reduce exposure to energy and natural gas price volatility and have no direct earnings impact as the costs are fully recovered from customers through regulatory-approved recovery mechanisms.

Proprietary Trading (Commodity Price Risk)

Generation also executes commodity derivatives for proprietary trading purposes. Proprietary trading includes all contracts executed with the intent of benefiting from shifts or changes in market prices as opposed to those executed with the intent of hedging or managing risk. Gains and losses associated with proprietary trading are reported as Operating revenues in Exelon’s and Generation’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and are included in the Net fair value changes related to derivatives line in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the years ended

,


and


, net pre-tax commodity mark-to-market gains (losses) for Exelon and Generation were not material. The Utility Registrants do not execute derivatives for proprietary trading purposes.

Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Risk (Exelon and Generation)

Exelon and Generation utilize interest rate swaps, which are treated as economic hedges, to manage their interest rate exposure. On July 1, 2018, Exelon de-designated its fair value hedges related to interest rate risk and Generation de-designated its cash flow hedges related to interest rate risk. The notional amounts were

Credit Risk (All Registrants)

The Registrants would be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties on executed derivative instruments. The credit exposure of derivative contracts, before collateral, is represented by the fair value of contracts at the reporting date.

Generation.

For commodity derivatives, Generation enters into enabling agreements that allow for payment netting with its counterparties, which reduces Generation’s exposure to counterparty risk by providing for the offset of amounts payable to the counterparty against amounts receivable from the counterparty. Typically, each enabling agreement is for a specific commodity and so, with respect to each individual counterparty, netting is limited to

transactions involving that specific commodity product, except where master netting agreements exist with a counterparty that allow for cross product netting. In addition to payment netting language in the enabling agreement, Generation’s credit department establishes credit limits, margining thresholds and collateral requirements for each counterparty, which are defined in the derivative contracts.  Counterparty credit limits are based on an internal credit



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)

Note 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments

review process that considers a variety of factors, including the results of a scoring model, leverage, liquidity, profitability, credit ratings by credit rating agencies, and risk management capabilities. To the extent that a counterparty’s margining thresholds are exceeded, the counterparty is required to post collateral with Generation as specified in each enabling agreement. Generation’s credit department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates, both on an individual and an aggregate basis.

The following tables provide information on Generation’s credit exposure for all derivative instruments, NPNS and payables and receivables, net of collateral and instruments that are subject to master netting agreements, as of

December 31, 2019

. The tables further delineate that exposure by credit rating of the counterparties and provide guidance on the concentration of credit risk to individual counterparties. The figures in the tables below exclude credit risk exposure from individual retail counterparties, nuclear fuel procurement contracts and exposure through RTOs, ISOs, NYMEX, ICE, NASDAQ, NGX and Nodal commodity exchanges.

__________

(a)

As of

December 31, 2019

, credit collateral held from counterparties where Generation had credit exposure included

$


million

of cash and

$


million

of letters of credit. The credit collateral does not include non-liquid collateral.

Utility Registrants.

The Utility Registrants have contracts to procure electric and natural gas supply that provide suppliers with a certain amount of unsecured credit. If the exposure on the supply contract exceeds the amount of unsecured credit, the suppliers may be required to post collateral. The net credit exposure is mitigated primarily by the ability to recover procurement costs through customer rates. As of

December 31, 2019

, the Utility Registrants’ counterparty credit risk with suppliers was immaterial.

Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features (All Registrants)

Generation.

As part of the normal course of business, Generation routinely enters into physically or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of electric capacity, electricity, fuels, emissions allowances and other energy-related products. Certain of Generation’s derivative instruments contain provisions that require Generation to post collateral. Generation also enters into commodity transactions on exchanges where the exchanges act as the counterparty to each trade. Transactions on the exchanges must adhere to comprehensive collateral and margining requirements. This collateral may be posted in the form of cash or credit support with thresholds contingent upon Generation’s credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies. The collateral and credit support requirements vary by contract and by counterparty. These credit-risk related contingent features stipulate that if Generation were to be downgraded or lose its investment grade credit rating (based on its senior unsecured debt rating), it would be required to provide additional collateral. This incremental collateral requirement allows for the offsetting of derivative instruments that are assets with the same counterparty, where the contractual right of offset exists under applicable master netting agreements. In the absence of expressly agreed-to provisions that specify



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)

Note 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments

the collateral that must be provided, collateral requested will be a function of the facts and circumstances of the situation at the time of the demand. In this case, Generation believes an amount of several months of future payments (i.e., capacity payments) rather than a calculation of fair value is the best estimate for the contingent collateral obligation, which has been factored into the disclosure below.

The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk related contingent features in a liability position that are not fully collateralized (excluding transactions on the exchanges that are fully collateralized) is detailed in the table below:

__________

(a)

Amount represents the gross fair value of out-of-the-money derivative contracts containing credit-risk-related contingent features ignoring the effects of master netting agreements.

(b)

Amount represents the offsetting fair value of in-the-money derivative contracts under legally enforceable master netting agreements with the same counterparty, which reduces the amount of any liability for which a Registrant could potentially be required to post collateral.

(c)

Amount represents the net fair value of out-of-the-money derivative contracts containing credit-risk related contingent features after considering the mitigating effects of offsetting positions under master netting arrangements and reflects the actual net liability upon which any potential contingent collateral obligations would be based.

As of

December 31, 2019

and


, Exelon and Generation posted  or held the following amounts of cash collateral and letters of credit on derivative contracts with external counterparties, after giving consideration to offsetting derivative and non-derivative positions under master netting agreements.

Generation entered into supply forward contracts with certain utilities, including PECO and BGE, with one-sided collateral postings only from Generation. If market prices fall below the benchmark price levels in these contracts, the utilities are not required to post collateral. However, when market prices rise above the benchmark price levels, counterparty suppliers, including Generation, are required to post collateral once certain unsecured credit limits are exceeded.

Utility Registrants

The Utility Registrants’ electric supply procurement contracts do not contain provisions that would require them to post collateral.

PECO’s, BGE’s, and DPL’s natural gas procurement contracts contain provisions that could require PECO, BGE, and DPL to post collateral in the form of cash or credit support, which vary by contract and counterparty, with thresholds contingent upon PECO’s, BGE, and DPL’s credit rating. As of

December 31, 2019

, PECO, BGE, and DPL were not required to post collateral for any of these agreements. If PECO, BGE or DPL lost their investment grade credit rating as of

December 31, 2019

, they could have been required to post incremental collateral to its counterparties of

$


million

,

$


million

, and

$


million

, respectively.

VRDBs are subject to repayment on the demand of the holders and, for this reason, are accounted for as short-term debt in accordance with GAAP. However, these bonds may be converted to a fixed-rate, fixed-term option to establish a maturity which corresponds to the date of final maturity of the bonds. On this basis, PHI views VRDBs as a source of long-term financing. As of both

December 31, 2019

and

December 31, 2018

,

$


million

in variable rate demand bonds issued by DPL were outstanding and are included in the Long-term debt due within one year in Exelon's, PHI's and DPL's Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Debt Covenants

As of December 31, 2019,

the Registrants are in compliance with debt covenants, except for Antelope Valley's nonrecourse debt event of default as discussed below.

Nonrecourse Debt

Exelon and Generation have issued nonrecourse debt financing, in which approximately

$

2.8

billion

of generating assets have been pledged as collateral at

December 31, 2019

.  Borrowings under these agreements are secured by the assets and equity of each respective project.  The lenders do not have recourse against Exelon or Generation in the event of a default.  If a specific project financing entity does not maintain compliance with its specific nonrecourse debt financing covenants, there could be a requirement to accelerate repayment of the associated debt or other borrowings earlier than the stated maturity dates. In these instances, if such repayment was not satisfied, the lenders or security holders would generally have rights to foreclose against the project-specific assets and related collateral. The potential requirement to satisfy its associated debt or other borrowings earlier than otherwise anticipated could lead to impairments due to a higher likelihood of disposing of the respective project-specific assets significantly before the end of their useful lives.

Antelope Valley Solar Ranch One.

In December 2011, the DOE Loan Programs Office issued a guarantee for up to

$


million

for a nonrecourse loan from the Federal Financing Bank to support the financing of the construction of the Antelope Valley facility. The project became fully operational in 2014. The loan will mature on January 5, 2037. Interest rates on the loan were fixed upon each advance at a spread of

37.5

basis points above U.S. Treasuries of comparable maturity. The advances were completed as of December 31, 2015 and the outstanding loan balance will bear interest at an average blended interest rate of

2.82

%

. As of

December 31, 2019

, approximately

$


million

was outstanding. In addition, Generation has issued letters of credit to support its equity investment in the project. As of

December 31, 2019

, Generation had

$


million

in letters of credit outstanding related to the project. In 2017, Generation’s interests in Antelope Valley were also contributed to and are pledged as collateral for the EGR IV financing structure referenced below.

Antelope Valley sells all of its output to PG&E through a PPA. On January 29, 2019, PG&E filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which created an event of default for Antelope Valley’s nonrecourse debt that provides the lender with a right to accelerate amounts outstanding under the loan such that they would become immediately due and payable. As a result of the ongoing event of default and the absence of a waiver from the lender foregoing their acceleration rights, the debt was reclassified as current in Exelon’s and Generation’s Consolidated Balance Sheets in the first quarter of 2019 and continues to be classified as current as of

December 31, 2019

. Further, distributions from Antelope Valley to EGR IV are currently suspended.

Continental Wind.

In September 2013, Continental Wind, LLC (Continental Wind), an indirect subsidiary of Exelon and Generation, completed the issuance and sale of

$


million

senior secured notes. Continental Wind owns

(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)

Note 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements

and operates a portfolio of wind farms in Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, Oregon, New Mexico and Texas with a total net capacity of


MW. The net proceeds were distributed to Generation for its general business purposes.  The notes are scheduled to mature on February 28, 2033.  The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of

6.00

%

with interest payable semi-annually.  As of

December 31, 2019

,

$


million

was outstanding.

In addition, Continental Wind entered into a

$


million

letter of credit facility and

$


million

working capital revolver facility. Continental Wind has issued letters of credit to satisfy certain of its credit support and security obligations. As of

December 31, 2019

, the Continental Wind letter of credit facility had

$


million

in letters of credit outstanding related to the project.

In 2017, Generation’s interests in Continental Wind were contributed to EGRP. Refer to Note

Renewable Power Generation.

In March 2016, RPG, an indirect subsidiary of Exelon and Generation, issued

$


million

aggregate principal amount of a nonrecourse senior secured notes.  The net proceeds were distributed to Generation for paydown of long term debt obligations at Sacramento PV Energy and Constellation Solar Horizons and for general business purposes.  The loan is scheduled to mature on March 31, 2035.  The term loan bears interest at a fixed rate of

4.11

%

payable semi-annually.  As of

was outstanding.

In 2017, Generation’s interests in Renewable Power Generation were contributed to EGRP. Refer to Note

SolGen.

In September 2016, SolGen, LLC (SolGen), an indirect subsidiary of Exelon and Generation, issued

$


million

aggregate principal amount of a nonrecourse senior secured notes.  The net proceeds were distributed to Generation for general business purposes.  The loan is scheduled to mature on September 30, 2036.  The term loan bears interest at a fixed rate of

3.93

%

payable semi-annually.  As of

December 31, 2019

,

$


million

was outstanding.

In 2017, Generation’s interests in SolGen were also contributed to and are pledged as collateral for the EGR IV financing structure referenced below.

ExGen Renewables IV.

In November 2017, EGR IV, an indirect subsidiary of Exelon and Generation, entered into an

$


million

nonrecourse senior secured term loan credit facility agreement. Generation’s interests in EGRP, Antelope Valley, SolGen, and Albany Green Energy were all contributed to and are pledged as collateral for this financing. The net proceeds of

$


million

, after the initial funding of

$


million

for debt service and liquidity reserves as well as deductions for original discount and estimated costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the execution and delivery of the credit facility agreement, were distributed to Generation for general corporate purposes. The

$


million

of debt service and liquidity reserves was treated as restricted cash in Exelon’s and Generation’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The loan is scheduled to mature on November 28, 2024.  The term loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR +


%

, subject to a


%

LIBOR floor with interest payable quarterly.  As of

December 31, 2019

,

$


million

was outstanding. In addition to the financing, EGR IV entered into interest rate swaps with an initial notional amount of

$


million

at an interest rate of

2.32

%

to manage a portion of the interest rate exposure in connection with the financing.

Although Antelope Valley’s debt is in default, it is nonrecourse to EGR IV. However, if in the future Antelope Valley were to file for bankruptcy protection as a result of events culminating from PG&E’s bankruptcy proceedings this would represent an event of default for EGR IV’s debt that would provide the lender with an opportunity to accelerate EGR IV’s debt.

Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities

(All Registrants)

Exelon measure and records

fair value measurements in accordance with the hierarchy as defined by GAAP

. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels as follows:

•

Level 1 — quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Registrants have the ability to liquidate as of the reporting date.

•

Level 2 — inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through corroboration with observable market data.



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)

Note 17 — Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities

•

Level 3 — unobservable inputs, such as internally developed pricing models or third-party valuations for the asset or liability due to little or no market activity for the asset or liability.

Fair Value of Financial Liabilities Recorded at the Carrying Amount

The following tables present the carrying amounts and fair values of the Registrants’ short-term liabilities, long-term debt, SNF obligation, and trust preferred securities (long-term debt to financing trusts or junior subordinated debentures) as of

December 31, 2019

Note 17 — Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities

Valuation Techniques Used to Determine Fair Value

Cash Equivalents (All Registrants).

Investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased, including mutual and money market funds, are considered cash equivalents. The fair values are based on observable market prices and, therefore, are included in the recurring fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1.

NDT Fund Investments (Exelon and Generation).

The trust fund investments have been established to satisfy Generation’s and CENG's nuclear decommissioning obligations as required by the NRC. The NDT funds hold debt and equity securities directly and indirectly through commingled funds and mutual funds, which are included in equities and fixed income. Generation’s and CENG's NDT fund investments policies outline investment guidelines for the trusts and limit the trust funds’ exposures to investments in highly illiquid markets and other alternative investments, including private credit, private equity and real estate. Investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased, including certain short-term fixed income securities are considered cash equivalents and included in the recurring fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1 or Level 2.

Equities.

These investments consist of individually held equity securities, equity mutual funds and equity commingled funds in domestic and foreign markets.  With respect to individually held equity securities, the trustees obtain prices from pricing services, whose prices are generally obtained from direct feeds from market exchanges, which Exelon and Generation are able to independently corroborate. Equity securities held individually, including real estate investment trusts, rights and warrants, are primarily traded on exchanges that contain only actively traded securities due to the volume trading requirements imposed by these exchanges. The equity securities that are held directly by the trust funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and categorized as Level 1. Certain equity securities have been categorized as Level 2 because they are based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information or similar securities. Certain private placement equity securities are categorized as Level 3 because they are not publicly traded and are priced using significant unobservable inputs.

Equity commingled funds and mutual funds are maintained by investment companies, and fund investments are held in accordance with a stated set of fund objectives. The values of some of these funds are publicly quoted. For mutual funds which are publicly quoted, the funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and have been categorized as Level 1. For equity commingled funds and mutual funds which are not publicly quoted, the fund administrators value the funds using the NAV per fund share, derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities and are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. These investments typically can be redeemed monthly or more frequently, with 30 or less days of notice and without further restrictions.

Fixed income.

For fixed income securities, which consist primarily of corporate debt securities, U.S. government securities, foreign government securities, municipal bonds, asset and mortgage-backed securities, commingled funds, mutual funds and derivative instruments, the trustees obtain multiple prices from pricing vendors whenever possible, which enables cross-provider validations in addition to checks for unusual daily movements. A primary price source is identified based on asset type, class or issue for each security.  With respect to individually held fixed income securities, the trustees monitor prices supplied by pricing services and may use a supplemental price source or change the primary price source of a given security if the portfolio managers challenge an assigned price and the trustees determine that another price source is considered to be preferable. Exelon and Generation have obtained an understanding of how these prices are derived, including the nature and observability of the inputs used in deriving such prices. Additionally, Exelon and Generation selectively corroborate the fair values of securities by comparison to other market-based price sources. Investments in U.S. Treasury securities have been categorized as Level 1 because they trade in highly-liquid and transparent markets. Certain private placement fixed income securities have been categorized as Level 3 because they are priced using certain significant unobservable inputs and are typically illiquid. The remaining fixed income securities, including certain other fixed income investments,



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)

Note 17 — Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities

are based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information of similar securities, adjusted for observable differences and are categorized as Level 2.

Other fixed income investments primarily consist of fixed income commingled funds and mutual funds, which are maintained by investment companies and hold fund investments in accordance with a stated set of fund objectives. The values of some of these funds are publicly quoted. For mutual funds which are publicly quoted, the funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and have been categorized as Level 1. For fixed income commingled funds and mutual funds which are not publicly quoted, the fund administrators value the funds using the NAV per fund share, derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities and are not classified within the fair value hierarchy.  These investments typically can be redeemed monthly or more frequently, with 30 or less days of notice and without further restrictions.

Derivative instruments.

These instruments, consisting primarily of futures and swaps to manage risk, are recorded at fair value.  Over-the-counter derivatives are valued daily based on quoted prices in active markets and trade in open markets, and have been categorized as Level 1.  Derivative instruments other than over-the-counter derivatives are valued based on external price data of comparable securities and have been categorized as Level 2.

Private credit.

Private credit investments primarily consist of investments in private debt strategies.  These investments are generally less liquid assets with an underlying term of 3 to 5 years and are intended to be held to maturity.  The fair value of these investments is determined by the fund manager or administrator and include unobservable inputs such as cost, operating results, and discounted cash flows. Private credit investments held directly by Exelon and Generation are categorized as Level 3 because they are based largely on inputs that are unobservable and utilize complex valuation models. Private credit fund investments with multiple investors are not classified within the fair value hierarchy because their fair value is determined using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient.

Private equity.

These investments include those in limited partnerships that invest in operating companies that are not publicly traded on a stock exchange such as leveraged buyouts, growth capital, venture capital, distressed investments and investments in natural resources. Private equity valuations are reported by the fund manager and are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include unobservable inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data.  The fair value of private equity investments is determined using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient, and therefore, these investments are not classified within the fair value hierarchy.

Real estate.

These investments are funds with a direct investment in pools of real estate properties. These funds are valued by investment managers on a periodic basis using pricing models that use independent appraisals from sources with professional qualifications. These valuation inputs are not highly observable.  The fair value of real estate investments is determined using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient, and therefore, these investments are not classified within the fair value hierarchy.

Generation evaluated its NDT portfolios for the existence of significant concentrations of credit risk as of

December 31, 2019

. Types of concentrations that were evaluated include, but are not limited to, investment concentrations in a single entity, type of industry, foreign country, and individual fund. As of

December 31, 2019

, there were no significant concentrations (generally defined as greater than 10 percent) of risk in Generation's NDT assets.

Rabbi Trust Investments (Exelon, Generation, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE).

The Rabbi trusts were established to hold assets related to deferred compensation plans existing for certain active and retired members of Exelon’s executive management and directors. The Rabbi trusts' assets are included in investments in the Registrants’ Consolidated Balance Sheets and consist primarily of money market funds, mutual funds, fixed income securities and life insurance policies. Money market funds and mutual funds are publicly quoted and have been categorized as Level 1 given the clear observability of the prices.  The fair values of fixed income securities are based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information or similar securities, adjusted for observable differences and are categorized in Level 2. The life insurance policies are valued using the cash surrender value of the policies, net of loans against those policies, which is provided by a third-party. Certain life insurance policies, which consist primarily of mutual funds that are priced based on observable market



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)

Note 17 — Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities

data, have been categorized as Level 2 because the life insurance policies can be liquidated at the reporting date for the value of the underlying assets.  Life insurance policies that are valued using unobservable inputs have been categorized as Level 3, where the fair value is determined based on the cash surrender value of the policy, which contains unobservable inputs and assumptions.  Because Exelon relies on its third-party insurance provider to develop the inputs without adjustment for the valuations of its Level 3 investments, quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs used in valuing these investments is not reasonably available to Exelon.  Therefore, Exelon has not disclosed such inputs.

The Registrants’ deferred compensation plans allow participants to defer certain cash compensation into a notional investment account. The Registrants include such plans in other current and noncurrent liabilities in their Consolidated Balance Sheets. The value of the Registrants’ deferred compensation obligations is based on the market value of the participants’ notional investment accounts. The underlying notional investments are comprised primarily of equities, mutual funds, commingled funds and fixed income securities which are based on directly and indirectly observable market prices. Since the deferred compensation obligations themselves are not exchanged in an active market, they are categorized as Level 2 in

the fair value hierarchy.

The value of certain employment agreement obligations (which are included with the Deferred Compensation Obligation in the tables above) are based on a known and certain stream of payments to be made over time and are categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

Mark-to-Market Derivatives (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PHI and DPL).

Derivative contracts are traded in both exchange-based and non-exchange-based markets. Exchange-based derivatives that are valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets are categorized in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Certain derivatives’ pricing is verified using indicative price quotations available through brokers or over-the-counter, on-line exchanges and are categorized in Level 2. These price quotations reflect the average of the bid-ask, mid-point prices and are obtained from sources that the Registrants believe provide the most liquid market for the commodity. The price quotations are reviewed and corroborated to ensure the prices are observable and representative of an orderly transaction between market participants. This includes consideration of actual transaction volumes, market delivery points, bid-ask spreads and contract duration. The remainder of derivative contracts are valued using the Black model, an industry standard option valuation model. The Black model takes into account inputs such as contract terms, including maturity, and market parameters, including assumptions of the future prices of energy, interest rates, volatility, credit worthiness and credit spread. For derivatives that trade in liquid markets, such as generic forwards, swaps and options, model inputs are generally observable. Such instruments are categorized in Level 2. The Registrants’ derivatives are predominantly at liquid trading points. For derivatives that trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information, model inputs generally would include both observable and unobservable inputs. These valuations may include an estimated basis adjustment from an illiquid trading point to a liquid trading point for which active price quotations are available. Such instruments are categorized in Level 3.

For valuations that include both observable and unobservable inputs, if the unobservable input is determined to be significant to the overall inputs, the entire valuation is categorized in Level 3. This includes derivatives valued using indicative price quotations whose contract tenure extends into unobservable periods. In instances where observable data is unavailable, consideration is given to the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. This includes assumptions about market risks such as liquidity, volatility and contract duration. Such instruments are categorized in Level 3 as the model inputs generally are not observable. Forward price curves for the power market utilized by the front office to manage the portfolio, are reviewed and verified by the middle office, and used for financial reporting by the back office. The Registrants consider credit and nonperformance risk in the valuation of derivative contracts categorized in Level 2 and 3, including both historical and current market data in its assessment of credit and nonperformance risk by counterparty. Due to master netting agreements and collateral posting requirements, the impacts of credit and nonperformance risk were not material to the financial statements.

Disclosed below is detail surrounding the Registrants’ significant Level 3 valuations.  The calculated fair value includes marketability discounts for margining provisions and other attributes.  Generation’s Level 3 balance generally consists of forward sales and purchases of power and natural gas and certain transmission congestion contracts. Generation utilizes various inputs and factors including market data and assumptions that market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities as well as assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. The inputs and factors include forward commodity prices, commodity price volatility, contractual volumes, delivery location, interest rates, credit quality of counterparties and credit enhancements.

Note 17 — Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities

For commodity derivatives, the primary input to the valuation models is the forward commodity price curve for each instrument. Forward commodity price curves are derived by risk management for liquid locations and by the traders and portfolio managers for illiquid locations. All locations are reviewed and verified by risk management considering published exchange transaction prices, executed bilateral transactions, broker quotes, and other observable or public data sources. The relevant forward commodity curve used to value each of the derivatives depends on a number of factors, including commodity type, delivery location, and delivery period. Price volatility varies by commodity and location. When appropriate, Generation discounts future cash flows using risk free interest rates with adjustments to reflect the credit quality of each counterparty for assets and Generation’s own credit quality for liabilities. The level of observability of a forward commodity price varies generally due to the delivery location and delivery period. Certain delivery locations including PJM West Hub (for power) and Henry Hub (for natural gas) are more liquid and prices are observable for up to three years in the future. The observability period of volatility is generally shorter than the underlying power curve used in option valuations. The forward curve for a less liquid location is estimated by using the forward curve from the liquid location and applying a spread to represent the cost to transport the commodity to the delivery location. This spread does not typically represent a majority of the instrument’s market price. As a result, the change in fair value is closely tied to liquid market movements and not a change in the applied spread. The change in fair value associated with a change in the spread is generally immaterial. An average spread calculated across all Level 3 power and gas delivery locations is approximately

$

2.22

and

$

0.54

for power and natural gas, respectively. Many of the commodity derivatives are short term in nature and thus a majority of the fair value may be based on observable inputs even though the contract as a whole must be classified as Level 3.

On December 17, 2010, ComEd entered into several 20-year floating to fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers for the procurement of long-term renewable energy and associated RECs. See Note


—

Derivative Financial Instruments

for additional information. The fair value of these swaps has been designated as a Level 3 valuation due to the long tenure of the positions and internal modeling assumptions. The modeling assumptions include using natural gas heat rates to project long term forward power curves adjusted by a renewable factor that incorporates time of day and seasonality factors to reflect accurate renewable energy pricing. In addition, marketability reserves are applied to the positions based on the tenor and supplier risk.

Note 17 — Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities

The following table presents the significant inputs to the forward curve used to value these positions:

______

(a)

The valuation techniques, unobservable inputs and ranges are the same for the asset and liability positions.

(b)

The fair values do not include cash collateral posted on level three positions of

$


million

and

$


million

as of

December 31, 2019

and

December 31, 2018

, respectively.

(c)

Quoted forward natural gas rates are utilized to project the forward power curve for the delivery of energy at specified future dates. The natural gas curve is extrapolated beyond its observable period to the end of the contract’s delivery.

The inputs listed above, which are as of the balance sheet date, would have a direct impact on the fair values of the above instruments if they were adjusted. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of Generation’s commodity derivatives are forward commodity prices and for options is price volatility. Increases (decreases) in the forward commodity price in isolation would result in significantly higher (lower) fair values for long positions (contracts that give Generation the obligation or option to purchase a commodity), with offsetting impacts to short positions (contracts that give Generation the obligation or right to sell a commodity). Increases (decreases) in volatility would increase (decrease) the value for the holder of the option (writer of the option). Generally, a change in the estimate of forward commodity prices is unrelated to a change in the estimate of volatility of prices. An increase to the reserves listed above would decrease the fair value of the positions. An increase to the heat rate or renewable factors would increase the fair value accordingly. Generally, interrelationships exist between market prices of natural gas and power. As such, an increase in natural gas pricing would potentially have a similar impact on forward power markets.

Nuclear Insurance (Exelon and Generation)

Generation is subject to liability, property damage and other risks associated with major incidents at any of its nuclear stations. Generation has mitigated its financial exposure to these risks through insurance and other industry risk-sharing provisions.

The Price-Anderson Act was enacted to ensure the availability of funds for public liability claims arising from an incident at any of the U.S. licensed nuclear facilities and to limit the liability of nuclear reactor owners for such claims from any single incident. As of

December 31, 2019

, the current liability limit per incident is

$

13.9

billion

and is subject to change to account for the effects of inflation and changes in the number of licensed reactors at least once every five years with the last adjustment effective November 1, 2018. In accordance with the Price-Anderson Act, Generation maintains financial protection at levels equal to the amount of liability insurance available from private sources through the purchase of private nuclear energy liability insurance for public liability claims that could arise in the event of an incident. Effective January 1, 2017, the required amount of nuclear energy liability insurance purchased is

$


million

for each operating site.  Claims exceeding that amount are covered through mandatory participation in a financial protection pool, as required by the Price Anderson-Act, which provides the additional

$

13.5

billion

per incident in funds available for public liability claims. Participation in this secondary financial protection pool requires the operator of each reactor to fund its proportionate share of costs for any single incident that exceeds the primary layer of financial protection. Exelon’s share of this secondary layer would be approximately

$

2.9

billion

, however any amounts payable under this secondary layer would be capped at

$


million

per year.

In addition, the U.S. Congress could impose revenue-raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay public liability claims exceeding the

$

13.9

billion

limit for a single incident.

As part of the execution of the NOSA on April 1, 2014, Generation executed an Indemnity Agreement pursuant to which Generation agreed to indemnify EDF and its affiliates against third-party claims that may arise from any future nuclear incident (as defined in the Price-Anderson Act) in connection with the CENG nuclear plants or their operations. Exelon guarantees Generation’s obligations under this indemnity.  See Note


—

Variable Interest Entities

for additional information on Generation’s operations relating to CENG.

Generation is required each year to report to the NRC the current levels and sources of property insurance that demonstrates Generation possesses sufficient financial resources to stabilize and decontaminate a reactor and reactor station site in the event of an accident. The property insurance maintained for each facility is currently provided through insurance policies purchased from NEIL, an industry mutual insurance company of which Generation is a member.

NEIL may declare distributions to its members as a result of favorable operating experience. In recent years, NEIL has made distributions to its members, but Generation cannot predict the level of future distributions or if they will continue at all. Generation's portion of the annual distribution declared by NEIL is estimated to be

$


million

for


, and was

$


million

and

$


million

for


and


, respectively. In addition, in March 2018, NEIL declared a supplemental distribution.  Generation's portion of the supplemental distribution declared by NEIL was

$


million

.   The distributions were recorded as a reduction to Operating and maintenance expense within Exelon and Generation’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

Premiums paid to NEIL by its members are also subject to a potential assessment for adverse loss experience in the form of a retrospective premium obligation. NEIL has never assessed this retrospective premium since its formation in 1973, and Generation cannot predict the level of future assessments, if any.  The current maximum aggregate annual retrospective premium obligation for Generation is approximately

$


million

.  NEIL requires its members to maintain an investment grade credit rating or to ensure collectability of their annual retrospective premium obligation by providing a financial guarantee, letter of credit, deposit premium, or some other means of assurance.



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)

Note 18 — Commitments and Contingencies

NEIL provides “all risk” property damage, decontamination and premature decommissioning insurance for each station for losses resulting from damage to its nuclear plants, either due to accidents or acts of terrorism.  If the decision is made to decommission the facility, a portion of the insurance proceeds will be allocated to a fund, which Generation is required by the NRC to maintain, to provide for decommissioning the facility. In the event of an insured loss, Generation is unable to predict the timing of the availability of insurance proceeds to Generation and the amount of such proceeds that would be available. In the event that one or more acts of terrorism cause accidental property damage within a twelve-month period from the first accidental property damage under one or more policies for all insured plants, the maximum recovery by Exelon will be an aggregate of

$

3.2

billion

plus such additional amounts as the insurer may recover for all such losses from reinsurance, indemnity and any other source, applicable to such losses.

For its insured losses, Generation is self-insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recoverable from insurers or the nuclear industry, could also be borne by Generation. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on Exelon’s and Generation’s financial statements.

Spent Nuclear Fuel Obligation (Exelon and Generation)

Under the NWPA, the DOE is responsible for the development of a geologic repository for and the disposal of SNF and high-level radioactive waste. As required by the NWPA, Generation is a party to contracts with the DOE (Standard Contracts) to provide for disposal of SNF from Generation’s nuclear generating stations. In accordance with the NWPA and the Standard Contracts, Generation historically had paid the DOE one mill (

$

0.001

) per kWh of net nuclear generation for the cost of SNF disposal. Due to the lack of a viable disposal program, the DOE reduced the SNF disposal fee to zero in May 2014. Until a new fee structure is in effect, Exelon and Generation will not accrue any further costs related to SNF disposal fees. This fee may be adjusted prospectively to ensure full cost recovery.

Generation currently assumes the DOE will begin accepting SNF in 2030 and uses that date for purposes of estimating the nuclear decommissioning asset retirement obligations. The SNF acceptance date assumption is based on management’s estimates of the amount of time required for DOE to select a site location and develop the necessary infrastructure for long-term SNF storage.

The NWPA and the Standard Contracts required the DOE to begin taking possession of SNF generated by nuclear generating units by no later than January 31, 1998. The DOE, however, failed to meet that deadline and its performance is expected to be delayed significantly. In August 2004, Generation and the DOJ, in close consultation with the DOE, reached a settlement under which the government agreed to reimburse Generation, subject to certain damage limitations based on the extent of the government’s breach, for costs associated with storage of SNF at Generation’s nuclear stations pending the DOE’s fulfillment of its obligations.  Generation’s settlement agreement does not include FitzPatrick and FitzPatrick does not currently have a settlement agreement in place.  Calvert Cliffs, Ginna and Nine Mile Point each have separate settlement agreements in place with the DOE which were extended during 2017 to provide for the reimbursement of SNF storage costs through December 31, 2019.   Generation expects the terms for each of the settlement agreements to be extended during 2020 for another three years to cover SNF storage costs through December 31, 2022. Generation submits annual reimbursement requests to the DOE for costs associated with the storage of SNF. In all cases, reimbursement requests are made only after costs are incurred and only for costs resulting from DOE delays in accepting the SNF.

Under the settlement agreements, Generation has received cumulative cash reimbursements for costs incurred as follows:

__________

(a)

Total after considering amounts due to co-owners of certain nuclear stations and to the former owner of Oyster Creek.

.

The Standard Contracts with the DOE also required the payment to the DOE of a one-time fee applicable to nuclear generation through April 6, 1983.

The below table outlines the SNF liability recorded at Exelon and Generation as of

December 31, 2019

and


:

__________

(a)

ComEd previously elected to defer payment of the one-time fee of

$


million

for its units (which are now part of Generation), with interest to the date of payment, until just prior to the first delivery of SNF to the DOE. The unfunded liabilities for SNF disposal costs, including the one-time fee, were transferred to Generation as part of Exelon’s 2001 corporate restructuring.

(b)

A prior owner of FitzPatrick elected to defer payment of the one-time fee of

$


million

, with interest to the date of payment, for the FitzPatrick unit.   As part of the FitzPatrick acquisition on March 31, 2017, Generation assumed a SNF liability for the DOE one-time fee obligation with interest related to FitzPatrick along with an offsetting asset, included in Other deferred debits and other assets, for the contractual right to reimbursement from NYPA, a prior owner of FitzPatrick, for amounts paid for the FitzPatrick DOE one-time fee obligation

.

Interest for Exelon's and Generation's SNF liabilities accrues at the 13-week Treasury Rate. The 13-week Treasury Rate in effect for calculation of the interest accrual at

December 31, 2019

was

%

for the deferred amount transferred from ComEd and

Environmental Remediation Matters

General (All Registrants).

The Registrants’ operations have in the past, and may in the future, require substantial expenditures to comply with environmental laws. Additionally, under Federal and state environmental laws, the Registrants are generally liable for the costs of remediating environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by them and of property contaminated by hazardous substances generated by them. The Registrants own or lease a number of real estate parcels, including parcels on which their operations or the operations of others may have resulted in contamination by substances that are considered hazardous under environmental laws. In addition, the Registrants are currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been deposited and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future. Unless otherwise disclosed, the Registrants cannot reasonably estimate whether they will incur significant liabilities for additional investigation and remediation costs at these or additional sites identified by the Registrants, environmental agencies



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)

Note 18 — Commitments and Contingencies

or others, or whether such costs will be recoverable from third parties, including customers. Additional costs could have a material, unfavorable impact on the Registrants' financial statements.

MGP Sites (Exelon and the Utility Registrants).

ComEd, PECO, BGE and DPL have identified sites where former MGP or gas purification activities have or may have resulted in actual site contamination. For almost all of these sites, there are additional PRPs that may share responsibility for the ultimate remediation of each location.

•

ComEd has


sites that are currently under some degree of active study and/or remediation. ComEd expects the majority of the remediation at these sites to continue through at least 2025.

•

PECO has


sites that are currently under some degree of active study and/or remediation. PECO expects the majority of the remediation at these sites to continue through at least 2022.

•

BGE has


sites that currently require some level of remediation and/or ongoing activity. BGE expects the majority of the remediation at these sites to continue through at least 2021.

•

DPL has


site that is currently under study and the required cost at the site is not expected to be material.

The historical nature of the MGP and gas purification sites and the fact that many of the sites have been buried and built over, impacts the ability to determine a precise estimate of the ultimate costs prior to initial sampling and determination of the exact scope and method of remedial activity. Management determines its best estimate of remediation costs using all available information at the time of each study, including probabilistic and deterministic modeling for ComEd and PECO, and the remediation standards currently required by the applicable state environmental agency. Prior to completion of any significant clean up, each site remediation plan is approved by the appropriate state environmental agency.

ComEd, pursuant to an ICC order, and PECO, pursuant to settlements of natural gas distribution rate cases with the PAPUC, are currently recovering environmental remediation costs of former MGP facility sites through customer rates. While BGE and DPL do not have riders for MGP clean-up costs, they have historically received recovery of actual clean-up costs in distribution rates.

As of

December 31, 2019

and


, the Registrants had accrued the following undiscounted amounts for environmental liabilities in Other current liabilities and Other deferred credits and other liabilities within their respective Consolidated Balance Sheets:

Cotter Corporation (Exelon and Generation).

The EPA has advised Cotter Corporation (Cotter), a former ComEd subsidiary, that it is potentially liable in connection with radiological contamination at a site known as the West Lake Landfill in Missouri. In 2000, ComEd sold Cotter to an unaffiliated third-party. As part of the sale, ComEd agreed to indemnify Cotter for any liability arising in connection with the West Lake Landfill. In connection with Exelon’s 2001 corporate restructuring, this responsibility to indemnify Cotter was transferred to Generation. Including Cotter, there are three PRPs participating in the West Lake Landfill remediation proceeding. Investigation by Generation has identified a number of other parties who also may be PRPs and could be liable to contribute to the final remedy. Further investigation is ongoing.



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)

Note 18 — Commitments and Contingencies

In September 2018, the EPA issued its Record of Decision (ROD) Amendment for the selection of the final remedy. The ROD modified the EPA’s previously proposed plan for partial excavation of the radiological materials by reducing the depths of the excavation. The ROD also allows for variation in depths of excavation depending on radiological concentrations. The EPA and the PRPs have entered into a Consent Agreement to perform the Remedial Design, which is expected to be completed in the 2020 - 2021 time frame. In March 2019 the PRPs received Special Notice Letters from the EPA to perform the Remedial Action work. On October 8, 2019, Generation provided a non-binding good faith offer to conduct, or finance, a portion of the remedy, subject to certain conditions. The total estimated cost of the remedy, taking into account the current EPA technical requirements and the total costs expected to be incurred collectively by the PRPs in fully executing the remedy, is approximately

$


million

, including cost escalation on an undiscounted basis, which would be allocated among the final group of PRPs. Generation has determined that a loss associated with the EPA’s partial excavation and enhanced landfill cover remedy is probable and has recorded a liability included in the table above, that reflects management’s best estimate of Cotter’s allocable share of the ultimate cost. Given the joint and several nature of this liability, the magnitude of Generation’s ultimate liability will depend on the actual costs incurred to implement the required remediation remedy as well as on the nature and terms of any cost-sharing arrangements with the final group of PRPs. Therefore, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost and Generation’s associated allocable share could differ significantly once these uncertainties are resolved, which could have a material impact on Exelon's and Generation's future financial statements.

One of the other PRPs has indicated it will be making a contribution claim against Cotter for costs that it has incurred to prevent the subsurface fire from spreading to those areas of the West Lake Landfill where radiological materials are believed to have been disposed. At this time, Exelon and Generation do not possess sufficient information to assess this claim and therefore are unable to estimate a range of loss, if any. As such, no liability has been recorded for the potential contribution claim. It is reasonably possible, however, that resolution of this matter could have a material, unfavorable impact on Exelon’s and Generation's financial statements.

In January 2018, the PRPs were advised by the EPA that it will begin an additional investigation and evaluation of groundwater conditions at the West Lake Landfill. In September 2018, the PRPs agreed to an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent for the performance by the PRPs of the groundwater Remedial Investigation (RI)/Feasibility Study (FS). The purpose of this RI/FS is to define the nature and extent of any groundwater contamination from the West Lake Landfill site and evaluate remedial alternatives. Generation estimates the undiscounted cost for the groundwater RI/FS to be approximately

$


million

. Generation determined a loss associated with the RI/FS is probable and has recorded a liability included in the table above that reflects management’s best estimate of Cotter’s allocable share of the cost among the PRPs. At this time Generation cannot predict the likelihood or the extent to which, if any, remediation activities may be required and therefore cannot estimate a reasonably possible range of loss for response costs beyond those associated with the RI/FS component. It is reasonably possible, however, that resolution of this matter could have a material, unfavorable impact on Exelon’s and Generation’s future financial statements.

In August 2011, Cotter was notified by the DOJ that Cotter is considered a PRP with respect to the government’s clean-up costs for contamination attributable to low level radioactive residues at a former storage and reprocessing facility named Latty Avenue near St. Louis, Missouri. The Latty Avenue site is included in ComEd’s indemnification responsibilities discussed above as part of the sale of Cotter. The radioactive residues had been generated initially in connection with the processing of uranium ores as part of the U.S. Government’s Manhattan Project. Cotter purchased the residues in 1969 for initial processing at the Latty Avenue facility for the subsequent extraction of uranium and metals. In 1976, the NRC found that the Latty Avenue site had radiation levels exceeding NRC criteria for decontamination of land areas. Latty Avenue was investigated and remediated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to funding under FUSRAP. The DOJ has not yet formally advised the PRPs of the amount that it is seeking, but it is believed to be approximately

$


million

from all PRPs.

Pursuant to a series of annual agreements since 2011, the DOJ and the PRPs have tolled the statute of limitations until February 2020 so that settlement discussions could proceed.

Generation has determined that a loss associated with this matter is probable under its indemnification agreement with Cotter and has recorded an estimated liability, which is included in the table above.

Benning Road Site (Exelon, Generation, PHI and Pepco)

. In September 2010, PHI received a letter from EPA identifying the Benning Road site as one of six land-based sites potentially contributing to contamination of the lower Anacostia River. A portion of the site was formerly the location of a Pepco Energy Services electric generating facility, which was deactivated in June 2012. The remaining portion of the site consists of a Pepco transmission and distribution service center that remains in operation. In December 2011, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia approved a Consent Decree entered into by Pepco and Pepco Energy Services with the DOEE, which



Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)

Note 18 — Commitments and Contingencies

requires Pepco and Pepco Energy Services to conduct a RI/FS for the Benning Road site and an approximately 10 to 15-acre portion of the adjacent Anacostia River.

Since 2013, Pepco and Pepco Energy Services (now Generation, pursuant to Exelon's 2016 acquisition of PHI) have been performing RI work and have submitted multiple draft RI reports to the DOEE.  In September 2019, Pepco and Generation  issued a draft “final” RI report which DOEE approved and on October 4, 2019 released this document for review and comment by the public. The 45 day comment period ended on November 18, 2019 and a public meeting was held by Pepco on November 2, 2019. Pepco and Generation will proceed to develop a FS to evaluate possible remedial alternatives for submission to DOEE. The Court has established a schedule for completion of the FS, and approval by the DOEE, by September 16, 2021.

DOEE will then prepare a Proposed Plan and issue a Record of Decision identifying any further response actions determined to be necessary, after considering public comment on the Proposed Plan. PHI, Pepco and Generation have determined that a loss associated with this matter is probable and have accrued an estimated liability, which is included in the table above.

Anacostia River Tidal Reach (Exelon, PHI and Pepco)

. Contemporaneous with the Benning Road site RI/FS being performed by Pepco and Generation, DOEE and the National Park Service have been conducting a separate RI/FS focused on the entire tidal reach of the Anacostia River extending from just north of the Maryland-District of Columbia boundary line to the confluence of the Anacostia and Potomac Rivers. The river-wide RI incorporated the results of the river sampling performed by Pepco and Pepco Energy Services as part of the Benning RI/FS, as well as similar sampling efforts conducted by owners of other sites adjacent to this segment of the river and supplemental river sampling conducted by DOEE’s contractor. DOEE asked Pepco, along with parties responsible for other sites along the river, to participate in a "Consultative Working Group" to provide input into the process for future remedial actions and to ensure proper coordination with the other river cleanup efforts currently underway, including cleanup of the river segment adjacent to the Benning Road site resulting from the Benning Road site RI/FS. In addition, the District of Columbia Council directed DOEE to form an official advisory committee made up of members of federal, state and local environmental regulators, community and environmental groups and various academic and technical experts to provide guidance and support to DOEE as the project progressed. This group, called the Anacostia Leadership Council, has met regularly since it was formed. Pepco has participated in the Consultative Working Group. In April 2018, DOEE released a draft RI report for public review and comment. Pepco submitted written comments to the draft RI and participated in a public hearing.

Pepco has determined that it is probable that costs for remediation will be incurred and recorded a liability in the third quarter 2019 for management’s best estimate of its share of those costs based on DOEE’s stated position following a series of meetings attended by representatives from the Anacostia Leadership Council and the Consultative Working Group. On December 27, 2019, DOEE released a Focused Feasibility Study (FFS) and a Proposed Plan (PP) for review and comment by the public which will be the basis for the Interim ROD, which is expected to be completed in September 2020. The FFS and PP are consistent with the DOEE’s stated position to follow an adaptive management approach which will allow several identified “hot spots” in the river to be addressed first while continuing to conduct studies and to monitor the river to evaluate improvements and determine potential future remediation plans. The adaptive management process chosen by DOEE is less intrusive, provides more long term environmental certainty, is less costly, and allows for site specific remediation plans already underway, including the plan for the Benning Road site to proceed to conclusion. The comment period ends on March 2, 2020 and a public meeting will be held on January 23, 2021. Pepco concluded that incremental exposure remains reasonably possible, however management cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss beyond the amounts recorded, which are included in the table above.

In addition to the activities associated with the remedial process outlined above, there is a complementary statutory program that requires an assessment to determine if any natural resources have been damaged as a result of the contamination that is being remediated, and, if so, that a plan be developed by the federal, state and local Natural Resource Damage Trustees, who are defined by CERCLA as the responsible parties for the restoration or compensation for any loss of those resources from the environmental contaminants at the site. If natural resources cannot be restored, then compensation for the injury can be sought from the responsible parties. The assessment of Natural Resource Damages (NRD) typically takes place following cleanup because cleanups sometimes also effectively restore habitat. During the second quarter of 2018, Pepco became aware that the Trustees are in the beginning stages of this process that often takes many years beyond the remedial decision to complete. Pepco has concluded that a loss associated with the eventual NRD assessment is reasonably possible. Due to the very early stage of the assessment process, Pepco cannot reasonably estimate the range of loss.

Litigation and Regulatory Matters

Asbestos Personal Injury Claims (Exelon and Generation).

Generation maintains a reserve for claims associated with asbestos-related personal injury actions in certain facilities that are currently owned by Generation or were previously owned by ComEd and PECO. The estimated liabilities are recorded on an undiscounted basis and exclude the estimated legal costs associated with handling these matters, which could be material.

At

December 31, 2019

and


, Exelon and Generation had recorded estimated liabilities of approximately

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, in total for asbestos-related bodily injury claims. As of

December 31, 2019

, approximately

$


million

of this amount related to


open claims presented to Generation, while the remaining

$


million

is for estimated future asbestos-related bodily injury claims anticipated to arise through 2055, based on actuarial assumptions and analyses, which are updated on an annual basis. On a quarterly basis, Generation monitors actual experience against the number of forecasted claims to be received and expected claim payments and evaluates whether adjustments to the estimated liabilities are necessary.

It is reasonably possible that additional exposure to estimated future asbestos-related bodily injury claims in excess of the amount accrued could have a material, unfavorable impact on Exelon’s and Generation’s financial statements.

Fund Transfer Restrictions (All Registrants).

Under applicable law, Exelon may borrow or receive an extension of credit from its subsidiaries. Under the terms of Exelon’s intercompany money pool agreement, Exelon can lend to, but not borrow from the money pool.

Under applicable law, Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL and ACE can pay dividends only from retained, undistributed or current earnings. A significant loss recorded at Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL or ACE may limit the dividends that these companies can distribute to Exelon.

ComEd has agreed in connection with financings arranged through ComEd Financing III that it will not declare dividends on any shares of its capital stock in the event that: (1) it exercises its right to extend the interest payment periods on the subordinated debt securities issued to ComEd Financing III; (2) it defaults on its guarantee of the payment of distributions on the preferred trust securities of ComEd Financing III; or (3) an event of default occurs under the Indenture under which the subordinated debt securities are issued. No such event has occurred.

PECO has agreed in connection with financings arranged through PEC L.P. and PECO Trust IV that PECO will not declare dividends on any shares of its capital stock in the event that: (1) it exercises its right to extend the interest payment periods on the subordinated debentures, which were issued to PEC L.P. or PECO Trust IV; (2) it defaults on its guarantee of the payment of distributions on the Series D Preferred Securities of PEC L.P. or the preferred trust securities of PECO Trust IV; or (3) an event of default occurs under the Indenture under which the subordinated debentures are issued. No such event has occurred.

BGE is subject to restrictions established by the MDPSC that prohibit BGE from paying a dividend on its common shares if (a) after the dividend payment, BGE’s equity ratio would be below


%

as calculated pursuant to the MDPSC’s ratemaking precedents or (b) BGE’s senior unsecured credit rating is rated by two of the three major credit rating agencies below investment grade. No such event has occurred.

Pepco is subject to certain dividend restrictions established by settlements approved in Maryland and the District of Columbia. Pepco is prohibited from paying a dividend on its common shares if (a) after the dividend payment, Pepco's equity ratio would be


%

as equity levels are calculated under the ratemaking precedents of the MDPSC and DCPSC or (b) Pepco’s senior unsecured credit rating is rated by one of the three major credit rating agencies below investment grade. No such event has occurred.

DPL is subject to certain dividend restrictions established by settlements approved in Delaware and Maryland. DPL is prohibited from paying a dividend on its common shares if (a) after the dividend payment, DPL's equity ratio would be


%

as equity levels are calculated under the ratemaking precedents of the DPSC and MDPSC or (b) DPL’s senior unsecured credit rating is rated by one of the three major credit rating agencies below investment grade. No such event has occurred.

ACE is subject to certain dividend restrictions established by settlements approved in New Jersey. ACE is prohibited from paying a dividend on its common shares if (a) after the dividend payment, ACE's equity ratio would be


%

as equity levels are calculated under the ratemaking precedents of the NJBPU or (b) ACE's senior unsecured credit rating is rated by one of the three major credit rating agencies below investment grade. ACE is also subject to a

City of Everett Tax Increment Financing Agreement (Exelon and Generation).

On April 10, 2017, the City of Everett petitioned the Massachusetts Economic Assistance Coordinating Council (EACC) to revoke the 1999 tax increment financing agreement (TIF Agreement) relating to Mystic Units 8 and 9 on the grounds that the total investment in Mystic Units 8 and 9 materially deviates from the investment set forth in the TIF Agreement. On October 31, 2017, a three-member panel of the EACC conducted an administrative hearing on the City’s petition. On November 30, 2017, the hearing panel issued a tentative decision denying the City’s petition, finding that there was no material misrepresentation that would justify revocation of the TIF Agreement. On December 13, 2017, the tentative decision was adopted by the full EACC. On January 12, 2018, the City filed a complaint in Massachusetts Superior Court requesting, among other things, that the court set aside the EACC’s decision, grant the City’s request to decertify the Project and the TIF Agreement, and award the City damages for alleged underpaid taxes over the period of the TIF Agreement. On January 8, 2020, the Massachusetts Superior Court affirmed the decision of the EACC denying the City's petition. The deadline for appeal is March 9, 2020. Generation continues to believe that the City’s claim lacks merit. Accordingly, Generation has not recorded a liability for payment resulting from such a revocation, nor can Generation estimate a reasonably possible range of loss, if any, associated with any such revocation. Further, it is reasonably possible that property taxes assessed in future periods, including those following the expiration of the current TIF Agreement in 2020, could be material to Generation’s financial statements.

Subpoenas (Exelon and ComEd).

Exelon and ComEd received a grand jury subpoena in the second quarter of 2019 from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois requiring production of information concerning their lobbying activities in the State of Illinois. On October 4, 2019, Exelon and ComEd received a second grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois requiring production of records of any communications with certain individuals and entities. On October 22, 2019, the SEC notified Exelon and ComEd that it has also opened an investigation into their lobbying activities. Exelon and ComEd have cooperated fully and intend to continue to cooperate fully and expeditiously with the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the SEC. Exelon and ComEd cannot predict the outcome of the U.S. Attorney's Office or the SEC investigations. No loss contingency has been reflected in Exelon's and ComEd's consolidated financial statements as this contingency is neither probable nor reasonably estimable at this time. Management is currently unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss as these matters are subject to change.

Subsequent to Exelon announcing the receipt of the subpoenas, a putative class action lawsuit has been filed against Exelon and certain officers of Exelon and ComEd alleging misrepresentations or omissions by Exelon purporting to relate to matters that are the subject of the subpoenas and the SEC investigation. Exelon believes that these claims lack merit and intends to defend against them, and though the costs or any loss associated with the lawsuit cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, Exelon does not believe that the lawsuit will have a material adverse impact on Exelon’s or ComEd’s consolidated financial statements.

General (All Registrants).

The Registrants are involved in various other litigation matters that are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. The Registrants maintain accruals for such losses that are probable of being incurred and subject to reasonable estimation. Management is sometimes unable to estimate an amount or range of reasonably possible loss, particularly where (1) the damages sought are indeterminate, (2) the proceedings are in the early stages, or (3) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories. In such cases, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans

(All Registrants)

Stock-Based Compensation Plans

Exelon grants stock-based awards through its LTIP, which primarily includes performance share awards, restricted stock units and stock options. At

December 31, 2019

, there were approximately

was not material.

Exelon receives a tax deduction based on the intrinsic value of the award on the exercise date for stock options and the distribution date for performance share awards and restricted stock units. For each award, throughout the requisite service period, Exelon recognizes the tax benefit related to compensation costs.

The following table presents information regarding Exelon’s realized tax benefit when distributed:

Performance Share Awards

Performance share awards are granted under the LTIP. The performance share awards are settled


%

in common stock and


%

in cash at the end of the three-year performance period, except for awards granted to vice presidents and higher officers that are settled


%

in cash if certain ownership requirements are satisfied.

The common stock portion of the performance share awards is considered an equity award and is valued based on Exelon's stock price on the grant date.  The cash portion of the performance share awards is considered a liability award which is remeasured each reporting period based on Exelon’s current stock price. As the value of the common stock and cash portions of the awards are based on Exelon’s stock price during the performance period, coupled with changes in the total shareholder return modifier and expected payout of the award, the compensation costs are subject to volatility until payout is established.

Note 20 — Stock-Based Compensation Plans

For nonretirement-eligible employees, stock-based compensation costs are recognized over the vesting period of three years using the straight-line method. For performance share awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, the value of the performance shares is recognized ratably over the vesting period, which is the year of grant.

Exelon processes forfeitures as they occur for employees who do not complete the requisite service period.

Restricted Stock Units

Restricted stock units are granted under the LTIP with the majority being settled in a specific number of shares of common stock after the service condition has been met. The corresponding cost of services is measured based on the grant date fair value of the restricted stock unit issued.

The value of the restricted stock units is expensed over the requisite service period using the straight-line method. The requisite service period for restricted stock units is generally three to

five years

. However, certain restricted stock unit awards become fully vested upon the employee reaching retirement-eligibility. The value of the restricted stock units granted to retirement-eligible employees is either recognized immediately upon the date of grant or through the date at which the employee reaches retirement eligibility. Exelon processes forfeitures as they occur for employees who do not complete the requisite service period.

•

Generation executed an Indemnity Agreement pursuant to which Generation agreed to indemnify EDF against third-party claims that may arise from any future nuclear incident (as defined in the Price-Anderson Act) in connection with the CENG nuclear plants or their operations. Exelon guarantees Generation’s obligations under this Indemnity Agreement. (See Note

EGRP

- EGRP is a collection of wind and solar project entities and some of these project entities are VIEs that are consolidated by EGRP. Generation owns a number of limited liability companies that build, own, and operate solar and wind power facilities some of which are owned by EGRP. While Generation or EGRP owns 100% of the solar entities and 100% of the majority of the wind entities, it has been determined that certain of the solar and wind entities are VIEs because the entities require additional subordinated financial support in the form of a parental guarantee of debt, loans from the customers in order to obtain the necessary funds for construction of the solar

facilities, or the customers absorb price variability from the entities through the fixed price power and/or REC purchase agreements. Generation is the primary beneficiary of these solar and wind entities that qualify as VIEs because Generation controls the design, construction, and operation of the facilities. Generation provides operating and capital funding to the solar and wind entities for ongoing construction, operations and maintenance and there is limited recourse related to Generation related to certain solar and wind entities.

In 2017, Generation’s interests in EGRP were contributed to and are pledged for the ExGen Renewables IV non-recourse debt project financing structure.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

All Registrants—Disclosure Controls and Procedures

During the fourth quarter of


, each registrant’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of that registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures related to the recording, processing, summarizing and reporting of information in that registrant’s periodic reports that it files with the SEC. These disclosure controls and procedures have been designed by each registrant to ensure that (a) information relating to that registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, that is required to be included in filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is accumulated and made known to that registrant’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, by other employees of that registrant and its subsidiaries as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and (b) this information is recorded, processed, summarized, evaluated and reported, as applicable, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Due to the inherent limitations of control systems, not all misstatements may be detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls could be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by collusion of two or more people.

Accordingly, as of

December 31, 2019

, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of each registrant concluded that such registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives.

All Registrants—Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Each registrant continually strives to improve its disclosure controls and procedures to enhance the quality of its financial reporting and to maintain dynamic systems that change as conditions warrant. However, there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of


that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, any of the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

All Registrants—Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is required to assess and report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

. As a result of that assessment, management determined that there were no material weaknesses as of

December 31, 2019

and, therefore, concluded that each registrant’s internal control over financial reporting was effective. Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is included in
