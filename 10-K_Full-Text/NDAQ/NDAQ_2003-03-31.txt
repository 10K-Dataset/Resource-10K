Nasdaq Overview

Nasdaq operates The Nasdaq Stock Market®, the world's largest electronic screen-based equity securities market and the world's largest equity
securities market based on share volume. Since its inception in 1971, Nasdaq has been a leader in utilizing technology to democratize and extend the reach of the securities markets.

Nasdaq
provides products and services in the following three principal categories:

•

Transaction
Services include collecting, processing, and disseminating price quotes of Nasdaq-listed securities, the routing and execution of buy and sell
orders for Nasdaq-listed securities, and transaction reporting services. Market participants in The Nasdaq Stock Market, consisting of market makers, electronic communication networks ("ECNs"),
registered stock exchanges and order entry firms, each of which is described below, are the users of Nasdaq's Transaction Services. For the year ended December 31, 2002, Transaction Services
accounted for revenue of $380.7 million, which represented approximately 47.6% of Nasdaq's total revenue. See "—Products and Services—Transaction Services" and "Item 7.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

•

Market
Information Services provide varying levels of quote and trade information to data vendors, who in turn sell the information to the public. For the
year ended December 31, 2002, Market Information Services accounted for revenue of $202.4 million, which represented approximately 25.3% of Nasdaq's total revenue. See
"—Products and Services—Market Information Services" and "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

•

Corporate
Client Group provides customer services and information products to Nasdaq-listed companies and is responsible for obtaining new listings on The
Nasdaq Stock Market. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Corporate Client Group accounted for revenue of $176.7 million, which represented approximately 22.1% of Nasdaq's total
revenue. See "—Products and Services—Corporate Client Group" and "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."


Nasdaq's
market model is one of "open architecture." As a fully electronic market, The Nasdaq Stock Market does not have a central trading floor. Participation in the trading activities
on The Nasdaq Stock Market is not limited to any fixed number of market participants. This allows a large number of broker-dealers with widely different business models and trading technologies to
participate in the Nasdaq network and compete with one another. The Nasdaq network, called the "Enterprise Wide Network II," is a telecommunications network that Nasdaq uses to deliver transaction and
market information services to its market participants. See "—Products and Services—Transaction Services." Market participants can access the Nasdaq network via the Nasdaq
Workstation II, Nasdaq's proprietary operating system for the Nasdaq network, or through other customized operating systems. See "—Products and Services—Transaction
Services—Access Services." Nasdaq market participants include market makers, ECNs, registered stock exchanges and order entry firms.

Market
makers, also known as dealers, provide liquidity (the ability of a security to absorb a large amount of buying and selling without substantial movement in price) by standing ready
to buy or sell securities at all times at publicly-quoted prices for their own account and by maintaining an inventory of securities for their customers. Market makers in a particular security are
required at all times to post their bid and offer prices (i.e., price at which they will buy and sell) into the Nasdaq network where they can be viewed and accessed by all market participants.
Approximately 375 market makers participate in The Nasdaq Stock Market. On average, securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market have 15 market makers. The minimum number of market makers for any
Nasdaq-listed stock is two and some securities have over 100 market makers.

In
addition to traditional market makers, the Nasdaq network also includes other broker-dealers operating as ECNs. ECNs provide electronic facilities for investors to trade directly with
one another without going through a market maker. ECNs operate as order-matching and order-routing mechanisms and do not maintain inventories of securities themselves. The flexibility of the Nasdaq
network means that innovators with new trading technologies or strategies have an opportunity to implement them quickly in The Nasdaq Stock Market.

An
order entry firm is a broker-dealer, but not a market maker or an ECN. An order entry firm can use Nasdaq services to view price quotations and enter marketable orders for execution
against the posted quotations of market makers and ECNs. As a result of a rule change by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on February 10, 2003, order entry firms are
allowed to enter non-marketable orders into SuperMontage

SM

(Nasdaq's primary order execution system for Nasdaq-listed securities) for anonymous display. The objective of this
rule change is to remove a barrier to full participation in SuperMontage and thereby deepen liquidity and enhance Nasdaq's competitive position.

Nasdaq's
electronic systems centralize the price quotations from all market participants in a given Nasdaq-listed stock to help them compete and allow them to choose with whom they are
going to trade. Nasdaq also gathers the trade and quote information from all of these market participants and passes it on to data vendors who sell this information to the investment community and the
general public.

Nasdaq's
total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $799.2 million, a 6.8% decrease from $857.2 million during 2001. Nasdaq's net income increased 6.4%
for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $43.1 million from $40.5 million during 2001. Total revenue and net income numbers reflect a change in accounting principle adopted as of
January 1, 2000 ("Change in Accounting Principle"). See "Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data," "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" and "Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 4." Nasdaq's growth and operating results are directly affected by the trading volume of Nasdaq-listed


securities and the number of companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. The following table provides statistics about The Nasdaq Stock Market in these areas:

Nasdaq's History and Structure

Founded in 1971, Nasdaq was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD") until June 2000. The
NASD, which operates subject to the oversight of the SEC, is the largest self-regulatory organization ("SRO") in the U.S. with a membership that includes virtually every broker-dealer that
engages in the securities business with the U.S. public. The NASD must retain voting control over Nasdaq until such time as Nasdaq may be approved by the SEC for registration as a national securities
exchange ("Exchange Registration"), as discussed below.

In
2000, the NASD implemented a separation of Nasdaq from the NASD by restructuring and broadening the ownership in Nasdaq (the "Restructuring") through a two-phase private
placement of
securities commencing in June 2000. The principal goals of the Restructuring, among others, were to (i) raise proceeds to create a financially stronger Nasdaq better able to invest in
new technologies and address competitive challenges and global opportunities, (ii) raise proceeds to support the operations of the NASD, which would remain the principal SRO responsible for the
securities markets, and (iii) realign strategically the ownership of Nasdaq by enlisting a broad class of strategic investors interested in Nasdaq's long-term success. In the
private placements, (i) the NASD sold (A) an


aggregate of 10,806,494 warrants to purchase an aggregate amount of 43,225,976 shares of outstanding common stock of Nasdaq (the "Common Stock") and (B) 4,543,591 shares of outstanding Common
Stock and (ii) Nasdaq sold an aggregate of 28,692,543 newly-issued shares of Common Stock to investors. Securities in the private placements were offered to all NASD members, certain issuers
listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market, and certain investment companies. Each warrant issued by the NASD entitles the holder to purchase one share in each of four one-year exercise periods.
The first exercise period commenced after June 28, 2002 and will expire on June 28, 2003. As a result of the private placements of its Common Stock, Nasdaq became a reporting company
pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), on June 29, 2001, and became subject to the reporting requirements under Sections 13,
14 and 16 of the Exchange Act.

Trading
in the Common Stock commenced on July 1, 2002 on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board Service® ("OTC Bulletin Board") under the symbol
"NDAQ" upon expiration of contractual restrictions on shares of Common Stock sold in the private placement. During 2002, trading activity in Common Stock has been limited with average daily trading
volume of approximately 14,000 shares during the period from July through December 2002. See "—Risk Factors—There currently is a limited trading market for the Common
Stock."

As
part of the Restructuring, Nasdaq repurchased 18,461,538 shares of Common Stock from the NASD on May 3, 2001, for an aggregate purchase price of $240.0 million. On
March 8, 2002, Nasdaq completed a two stage repurchase of an additional 33,768,895 shares of Common Stock owned by the NASD, which represented all of the outstanding shares of Common Stock
owned by the NASD, except for the 43,225,976 shares of Common Stock underlying the warrants issued by the NASD in the private placements. Nasdaq purchased these shares of Common Stock for
$305.2 million in aggregate cash consideration, 1,338,402 shares of Nasdaq's Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock and one share of Nasdaq's Series B Preferred Stock (the
"Repurchase"). The NASD owns all of the outstanding shares of the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock. All of the shares of Common Stock repurchased by Nasdaq from the NASD have been
placed in Common Stock in treasury.

In
May 2001, Nasdaq sold $240.0 million of 4.0% convertible subordinated notes due 2006 (the "Subordinated Notes") to Hellman & Friedman Capital Partners IV, L.P.
and certain of its affiliated limited partnerships (collectively, "Hellman & Friedman"). Nasdaq used the proceeds from the sale of the Subordinated Notes to repurchase shares of Common Stock
from the NASD, as discussed above. At Nasdaq's 2002 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, stockholders approved an amendment to Nasdaq's Restated Certificate of Incorporation ("Certificate of
Incorporation") granting holders of the Subordinated Notes the right to vote with the holders of Common Stock and Series B Stock on matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. The holders of
the Subordinated Notes are entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Subordinated Notes could be converted, subject to the 5% voting limitation
contained in the Certificate of Incorporation.

In
connection with the Restructuring, Nasdaq filed an application with the SEC for Exchange Registration on November 9, 2000. In general, Exchange Registration is a change in
legal status for Nasdaq as opposed to a change in the way Nasdaq operates. Nasdaq's application for Exchange Registration was published by the SEC for public comment in 2001. Information relating to
Nasdaq's application can be found at the SEC's web site at

http://www.sec.gov/rules/other/34-44396.htm

. In November 2001, Nasdaq
agreed to the SEC's request for an indefinite extension of the date by which the SEC must approve Nasdaq's application or begin proceedings to determine whether the application should be denied.
Nasdaq continues to work with the SEC to address outstanding issues. While Nasdaq believes that the SEC will ultimately grant its application for Exchange Registration, there is no assurance that
Nasdaq's application for Exchange Registration will be granted or, if granted, the timing of such approval and what restrictions or changes the SEC will require in Nasdaq's operations or corporate
structure. See "—Risk Factors—The SEC may challenge or not approve Nasdaq's plan to


become a national securities exchange or it may require changes in the manner Nasdaq conducts its business before granting this approval."

In
connection with Exchange Registration, the SEC is conducting a review of Nasdaq's current rules and operations. As part of this review, the SEC required as a condition for its
approval of Exchange Registration and SuperMontage that the NASD develop and operate an alternative display facility ("ADF") for NASD members to assist in the quotation and transaction reporting of
exchange-listed securities. The SEC approved the NASD's proposals for the ADF on a pilot basis on July 24, 2002 and the ADF became operational in October 2002 at the same time as
SuperMontage. See "—Risk Factors—Competition by regional exchanges and the ADF may reduce Nasdaq's transactions, trade reporting and market information revenue and impact the
ability of SuperMontage to increase Nasdaq's market share of transactions in Nasdaq-listed securities."

Until
such time as Nasdaq may obtain Exchange Registration, Nasdaq's legal authority to operate as a stock market is delegated to it by the NASD under a plan approved by the SEC (the
"Delegation Plan"). Although Nasdaq exercises primary responsibility for market-related functions, including market-related rulemaking, all actions taken by Nasdaq pursuant to its delegated authority
are subject to review, ratification or rejection by the NASD. In addition, the Delegation Plan requires that the NASD retain greater than 50% of the voting control over Nasdaq. The share of
Series B Preferred Stock issued to the NASD in the Repurchase will ensure that the NASD maintains voting control until Exchange Registration. The voting power of the share of Series B
Preferred Stock is recalculated for each matter presented to stockholders as of the record date for the determination of the stockholders entitled to vote on the matter. The NASD, as holder of the
share of Series B Preferred Stock, will be entitled to cast the number of votes that, together with all other votes that the NASD is entitled to vote by virtue of ownership, proxies or voting
trusts, enables the NASD to cast one vote more than one-half of all votes entitled to be cast by stockholders. In addition, the shares of Common Stock underlying unexercised and unexpired
warrants as well as shares of Common Stock purchased through the valid exercise of warrants, will be voted by a trustee at the direction of the NASD until Exchange Registration. Shares of
Series A Preferred Stock do not have voting rights, except for the right as a class to elect two new directors to the Board of Directors at any time distributions on the Series A
Preferred Stock are in arrears for four consecutive quarters and as otherwise required by Delaware law. If Nasdaq obtains Exchange Registration, the share of Series B Preferred Stock will lose
its voting rights and will be redeemed by Nasdaq. Nasdaq may redeem the shares of Series A Preferred Stock at any
time after Exchange Registration and is required to use the net proceeds from an initial public offering ("IPO"), and upon the occurrence of certain other events, to redeem all or a portion of the
Series A Preferred Stock.

If
Nasdaq obtains Exchange Registration it will receive its own SRO status, separate from that of the NASD. Pursuant to the Exchange Act, SROs include any registered national securities
exchange, registered securities association (of which the NASD is currently the only one), or registered clearing agency, or, for certain purposes, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. In
general, an SRO is responsible for regulating its members through the adoption and enforcement of rules and regulations governing the business conduct of its members. As an SRO, Nasdaq will have its
own rules pertaining to its members and listed companies regarding listing, membership, and trading that are distinct and separate from those rules applicable generally to broker-dealers as
administered by the NASD. Broker-dealers will be able to choose to become members of Nasdaq, in addition to their other SRO memberships, including membership in the NASD.

Whether
or not Nasdaq is granted Exchange Registration is not expected to have a financial impact on Nasdaq in the short-term. In the long-term, however, Exchange
Registration is expected to improve the competitive position of Nasdaq. As an exchange, Nasdaq will no longer have to share revenue from certain proprietary products with certain other exchanges. An
independent Nasdaq will have greater access to the capital markets in order to raise funds for service enhancements and


increased flexibility to use its Common Stock in connection with acquisitions or other strategic partnerships.

Industry Overview

The securities market industry historically has included The Nasdaq Stock Market, the national stock exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and
the American Stock Exchange ("Amex"), and a number of regional exchanges. Some of these regional exchanges have a few exclusive "local" securities, but most compete in the business of trading the more
active NYSE-, Nasdaq-, and Amex-listed securities. The regional exchanges include the Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Pacific (which includes the Archipelago Exchange) and
Philadelphia exchanges.

Regulatory
and technological developments have led to gradual changes in the industry and have resulted in greater competition in the trading of securities. The emergence of alternative
trading systems—a term that refers generally to internal trading systems that are designed to match buyers and sellers of securities on an agency basis and includes ECNs—has
provided an additional venue for investors to transact certain trades. Nasdaq encourages the use of internal or alternative systems to trade securities and considers these systems an important
component of The Nasdaq Stock Market to the extent that they report trades through The Nasdaq Stock Market, display their best bid and offer on the market, and transact on The Nasdaq Stock Market.

National Market System

In the 1970s, Congress passed legislation and the SEC adopted rules to create a national market system to disseminate market information. As a result,
participants in U.S. securities markets have access to a consolidated stream of quotation and transaction information from all the exchanges and The Nasdaq Stock Market (acting under the Delegation
Plan) for most equity securities. The exchanges and The Nasdaq Stock Market act jointly to collect and disseminate this information under national market system plans approved by the SEC. The price
and transaction information collected under these national market system plans is sold for a fee to data vendors, who in turn sell the information to the public. These fees are referred to as "Tape
Fees." After costs are deducted, the Tape Fees are distributed among the participants in each of the national market system plans based on their transaction volume. The national market system plans
include:

•

The
Nasdaq Unlisted Trading Privileges Plan ("UTP Plan"), which collects and disseminates price and transaction information for securities listed on The
Nasdaq Stock Market. Members of the plan are the NASD and certain regional exchanges.

•

The
Consolidated Quotation Plan, which collects and disseminates quotation information for securities listed on the NYSE and Amex. All of the exchanges and
the NASD are members of this plan.


•

The
Consolidated Tape Association Plan, which collects and disseminates transaction information for NYSE and Amex securities. All of the exchanges and the
NASD are members of this plan.

•

The
Intermarket Trading System, which is a communications system that allows orders to be sent to the exchange or market quoting the best price. All of the
exchanges and the NASD are members of the Intermarket Trading System Plan.

Nasdaq,
operating under the Delegation Plan, currently acts on behalf of the NASD in each of these plans and intends to become a member in its own right of each of these plans when and
if it becomes an exchange.

Products and Services

Nasdaq's products and services fall into three principal categories:

(1)

Transaction
Services;

(2)

Market
Information Services; and

(3)

Corporate
Client Group.

Transaction Services.

Transaction Services are the core set of products designed to provide market
participants with access to The Nasdaq Stock Market, execution services that provide quoting and trading capabilities, and reporting services such as trade reporting and risk management. In addition,
Nasdaq provides transaction services for securities authorized for trading on the OTC Bulletin Board as well as exchange-listed securities that are traded in the
over-the-counter market by NASD members. See "—Other Products and Markets—Nasdaq InterMarket" and "—OTC Bulletin Board."

All
of Nasdaq's market participants are connected over an Enterprise Wide Network II jointly designed and managed by Nasdaq and WorldCom, Inc. ("WorldCom"). Nasdaq entered into a
contract with WorldCom in 1997 to design and support the network. That contract, as amended in June 2002, continues for three years from the date of the amendment. Pursuant to the agreement,
however, Nasdaq has the right to terminate the contract in certain circumstances after the second year. WorldCom charges Nasdaq monthly for use of the network. The network is scalable and reliable,
supporting trading volume of up to eight billion shares per day. Each market participant is connected to The Nasdaq Stock Market through paired connections with two lines to greatly reduce the risk of
connection failure. Although WorldCom declared bankruptcy in July 2002, Nasdaq does not foresee any interruption in service under the contract. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results Operations—Contractual Obligations and Contingent Commitments" and "Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 17."

Access Services.

Nasdaq provides access to its execution and trade reporting systems through four
products: Nasdaq Workstation II; the Application Program Interface that allows firms to create their own interface to The Nasdaq Stock Market; a Computer-to-Computer Interface
("CTCI") that provides for automated order entry, trade reporting and routing; and the Nasdaq Workstation WebLink system that provides browser-based access to The Nasdaq Stock Market via the Internet.

Nasdaq
Workstation II, introduced in 1995, is a software product that is installed on approximately 4,300 computer desktops to provide market participants with access to Nasdaq
transaction services. Nasdaq Workstation II is designed to provide a fast, flexible, reliable, and convenient trading environment capable of running on a variety of computers. In addition to the
Nasdaq Workstation II, the Application Program Interface allows approximately 2,770 users to access The Nasdaq Stock Market over customized interfaces developed by market participants. Using the
Application Program Interface, a firm can connect its internal systems to The Nasdaq Stock Market for order and position management. Access to The Nasdaq Stock Market via the Application Program
Interface instead of Nasdaq Workstation II represents a growing trend among Nasdaq market participants.


For
the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, Nasdaq's total revenue from Nasdaq Workstation II and the Application Program Interface was $118.4 million,
$142.9 million and $118.2 million, respectively. Nasdaq Workstation II and Application Program Interface fees accounted for approximately 14.8% of Nasdaq's total revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2002.

also provides CTCI for users to report trades, enter orders into, and receive execution messages through, SuperMontage. The CTCI links The Nasdaq Stock Market to automated firm
systems. This interface was upgraded in 2002 to a new protocol and delivers increased line speed. CTCI revenue accounted for approximately 2.1% of Nasdaq's total revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2002.

Nasdaq's
Workstation WebLink, an Internet browser-based system for small order-entry and market making firms, provides small firms with a low-cost option for performing basic
trade reporting and risk management functions as well as order routing. Workstation WebLink accounted for less than 1% of Nasdaq's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Execution Services.

As part of its price discovery function, Nasdaq provides collection, processing,
and dissemination of price quotations of Nasdaq-listed securities to its market participants. Price quotations are made up of two parts—the bid and the offer. The bid is the displayed
price at which the quoting market maker or ECN is prepared to buy the security from any seller in the marketplace. The offer is the displayed price at which the quoting market maker or ECN is prepared
to sell the security to any buyer in the marketplace. Since market makers and ECNs may wish to pay differing amounts to buy or sell a particular security, Nasdaq looks at all the price quotations of
the market makers and participating ECNs in that security and independently ranks the bids and offers so that one can easily determine the Nasdaq participant who is willing to sell the security for
the lowest price and the one who is willing to buy the security at the highest price. This combination of the best bid and the best offer is referred to as the "Nasdaq inside."

Once
price quotations have been entered into the Nasdaq system, Nasdaq processes the price quotations by updating the posted price and size (i.e., number of shares the posting party will
buy or
sell at that price) in response to messages received from the party posting the price quotation. Only registered market makers, ECNs and UTP Plan participants have the ability to post and adjust
quotations in the Nasdaq system. However, a recent rule change in 2003 permits order entry firms to enter non-marketable orders into SuperMontage for anonymous display.

Nasdaq
provides electronic routing of buy and sell orders for Nasdaq-listed securities to and from a market maker, order entry firm or ECN and the execution of those orders through the
use of automated systems. Order routing and execution are the terms generally used to describe how orders to buy and sell securities are directed to market participants as well as how these orders are
handled once they reach their destination. Order routing refers to the act of transmitting orders to another market participant for action. Order execution is a legally binding step in which orders
are executed, or responded to, once received by a market participant. During the fourth quarter of 2002, approximately 20.1% of Nasdaq's share volume (based on the aggregate number of shares traded)
came from orders routed and executed using a Nasdaq system, with the remainder coming from regional exchanges, the ADF and market participants' internal or alternative trading systems.

In order to use data more consistent with the separation of the Securities Information Processor "SIP" function from The Nasdaq Stock Market that
began in July 2002 (see "—Market Information Services"), the methodology for calculating systems market share of volume was adjusted. As a result, information on share volume market share
may not be comparable to any similar data previously provided by Nasdaq for prior periods based on the old methodology.

Nasdaq's primary execution system is now SuperMontage, which began its rollout on October 14, 2002, and was successfully extended to all
securities trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market on December 2, 2002. SuperMontage represents a major improvement in the ability of market participants to access, process, display and integrate
orders and quotes in The Nasdaq Stock Market. SuperMontage


has several strategic implications. It is intended to attract more orders to The Nasdaq Stock Market by providing a comprehensive display of the interest at the Nasdaq inside and four price levels
away, thus increasing competition and market transparency. SuperMontage also provides pre-trade anonymity to market participants using a Nasdaq system, i.e., prior to execution no one will
know the identity of the firm displaying the order unless such firm chooses to reveal its identity. Anonymous trading can contribute to improved pricing for securities by reducing the potential market
impact of large transactions and transactions by certain investors whose trading activity, if known, may be more likely to influence others.

By
allowing (but not requiring) market participants to give the Nasdaq system multiple orders at a single price level as well as at multiple price levels, SuperMontage assists market
participants with the management of their back book, i.e., orders that are not at the best price. This functionality also assists market participants in complying with the SEC's order handling rules.
These rules, among other things, require the display of customer limit orders priced better than a Nasdaq market maker's or a designated dealer's quote or that are for a larger number of shares at the
same price. Other system enhancements make it easier for participants to access ECNs via Nasdaq systems. Nasdaq is currently reviewing the functionality of SuperMontage and is considering certain
additional modifications to the
system requested by market participants. Nasdaq's goal is to build market share growth in 2003 by encouraging user acceptance of SuperMontage and Nasdaq will continue to use competitive pricing to
bring more order flow to SuperMontage.

The
primary fee for SuperMontage is a transaction execution charge, assessed on a per share basis to the party that accesses the liquidity provided by another market participant. In
certain circumstances, Nasdaq credits a portion of the per share execution charge to the market participant that provides the liquidity. In addition, certain types of SuperMontage orders are subject
to order entry and order cancellation charges. In February 2003, Nasdaq eliminated a fee that it had formerly charged when a market participant updated a quotation or non-marketable
limit order that it had posted in SuperMontage. SuperMontage generated revenue of $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Upon
complete implementation of SuperMontage in December 2002, Nasdaq retired several order routing and execution systems that had previously been used by The Nasdaq Stock Market.
These systems include:

•

The
Nasdaq National Market Execution System (also known as "SuperSoes

SM

"), which was fully implemented on July 30, 2001 and functioned
as the primary system for transactions in securities listed on The Nasdaq National Market. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, Nasdaq's total revenue from SuperSoes was
$109.7 million and $32.3 million, respectively. SuperSoes accounted for approximately 13.7% of Nasdaq's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002.

•

SelectNet,
which functioned as an automated Nasdaq service to facilitate order execution by linking all market participants that trade Nasdaq-listed
securities. Prior to the implementation of SuperSoes in July 2001, SelectNet was the primary system that market makers used to trade with one another. Since July 2001, SelectNet served
primarily as a means for participants to reach ECN quotes on The Nasdaq Stock Market and was also a tool for market makers seeking to negotiate trades with a particular counter-party or to broadcast
such an order to all market participants. Certain features of SelectNet have been incorporated into SuperMontage. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, Nasdaq's total revenue
from SelectNet was $28.7 million, $87.1 million and $113.5 million, respectively. SelectNet accounted for approximately 3.6% of Nasdaq's total revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2002.

•

SOES,
which routed and executed small orders of public customers seeking to trade securities listed on The Nasdaq SmallCap Market. Such transactions are now
also processed through


SuperMontage.
SOES accounted for less than 1% of Nasdaq's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002. For the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, Nasdaq's total revenue from
SOES was $26.1 million and $32.2 million, respectively. During 2000 and 2001, until the introduction of SuperSoes, SOES also executed orders for securities listed on The Nasdaq National
Market.

In
addition to SuperMontage, Nasdaq continues to offer several specialized transaction services including:

•

Advanced
Computerized Execution System ("ACES"), an order routing service that can be used by any Nasdaq market participant. Order entry firms that use ACES
generally route buy and sell orders to market makers after establishing a trading relationship. Market makers in turn leverage their internal systems to fill orders at the best price displayed in the
market. ACES participants can route orders directly to other participants through Nasdaq Workstation II, Nasdaq Workstation Weblink or their own proprietary systems. These orders are executed within
the participant's internal trading system and execution reports are routed back to the entering firm. ACES is often used to automate order routing and to connect order entry firms whose execution
volume is too low to justify the fixed costs of establishing a proprietary order management system. ACES fees are charged to the receiving firm only, and consist of graduated activity fees per
execution that decrease as the market maker's number of executions per month increases. ACES accounted for less than 1% of Nasdaq's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002.

•

Computer
Assisted Execution System

SM

("CAES

SM

"), the transaction service system for Nasdaq InterMarket, which is an electronic
marketplace where NASD members can trade securities listed on the NYSE or Amex. CAES allows users to direct orders in exchange-listed securities to other Nasdaq InterMarket market makers for automated
response and execution, and also provides access to the Intermarket Trading System. The Intermarket Trading System is a communications system that allows exchange-designated dealers, exchange floor
brokers, and NASD members to send orders for execution to the market quoting the best price. Nasdaq charges Nasdaq InterMarket participants a monthly fee per terminal to access to both systems
(CAES/Intermarket Trading System). In addition, a per transaction fee is charged to the originating party (i.e., the sender). CAES and Intermarket Trading System fees accounted for less than 1% of
Nasdaq's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002.

•

Primex
Auction System™ ("Primex"), which provides investors and participating market makers with an electronic, auction trading platform. Primex
allows users to seek price improvement opportunities by electronically exposing orders to market participants who compete for the orders at prices at, and within, the prevailing national best bid or
offer. Primex is operated pursuant to an agreement between Nasdaq and Primex Trading N.A., LLC, and began operation on December 17, 2001. Nasdaq imposes a monthly fee to access Primex, which
will vary based on the method used to access the system. Nasdaq charges execution fees to parties executing trades on shares available in the system. No execution fees are charged for submitting
orders that provide liquidity to the system. Nasdaq began charging access and execution fees for Primex on August 1, 2002. Primex accounted for less than 1% of Nasdaq's total revenue for the
year ended December 31, 2002.


Trade Reporting Services—Automated Confirmation Transaction Service

sm

("ACT

SM

").

U.S. securities
laws require that all registered stock exchanges and securities associations establish a transaction reporting plan for the central collection of price and volume information concerning trades
executed in those markets. Transactions in Nasdaq-listed securities, exchange-listed securities traded over-the-counter, and other equity securities traded
over-the-counter have traditionally been reported to the ACT system, Nasdaq's automated trade reporting and reconciliation service that electronically facilitates the
post-execution steps of price and volume reporting, comparison, and clearing of trades. A protocol establishes which of the two parties to the trade is responsible for trade reporting, and
NASD rules govern the timeliness of trade submission and the information required on each trade report.

ACT
provides three primary revenue-generating services: trade reporting, trade comparison, and risk management. The majority of trades reported to Nasdaq are locked-in
externally from the ACT system, and are submitted for reporting purposes only. These transaction reports are assessed a nominal reporting fee. Trades that require ACT to match and lock-in
the two parties to the trade generally are assessed a higher fee based upon the number of shares traded. A fee for the ACT risk management service is also applied to some of the transactions reported
to ACT. This fee is assessed to the firms that clear for each of the parties to the trade, provided that the trading parties are not designated as self-clearing firms. A cap on ACT risk
management fees was introduced in April 2000, limiting a clearing firm's monthly payment for each of its trading firms (correspondents) to $10,000 which, together with an increase in
self-clearing activity by member firms, resulted in a decline in risk management revenue in 2002 and 2001 versus 2000.

Shortly
after launching SuperMontage, Nasdaq launched Liquidity Tracker, an order routing system integrated with SuperMontage. Liquidity Tracker serves as a routing mechanism for
securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. It is intended primarily to attract large-sized orders, and affords the user an opportunity to gain access to the liquidity pool for a security without
incurring significant market impact. The order routing algorithm for Liquidity Tracker is based on current trade information within ACT. Liquidity Tracker scans trading information from ACT to
determine the best market participant to receive the order, and anonymously routes the order to that participant. Liquidity Tracker declines the order if there is not a qualifying market participant
available. Liquidity Tracker launched on December 4, 2002 as a pilot and Nasdaq did not charge for the system until January 6, 2003. Nasdaq also launched several new data products in
connection with the launch of SuperMontage, which are discussed in "—Market Information Services."

For
the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, Nasdaq's total revenue from ACT was $78.6 million, $87.3 million and $100.0 million, respectively. ACT
fees accounted for approximately 9.8% of Nasdaq's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002.

For
the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, Nasdaq's total revenue from Transaction Services was $380.7 million, $412.1 million and $398.5 million,
respectively. Transaction Services accounted for approximately 47.6% of Nasdaq's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Market Information Services.

Nasdaq collects and disseminates price quotations and information
regarding price and volume of executed trades. Market participants in The Nasdaq Stock Market have real-time access to quote and trade data. Interested parties that are not direct market
participants in The Nasdaq Stock Market also can receive real-time information through a number of Market Information Services products.

Nasdaq
collects information, distributes it, and earns revenue in two roles. First, Nasdaq operates the exclusive Securities Information Process, or "SIP," for the collection and
dissemination of best bid and offer (the "BBO") and last transaction information from all of the exchanges and markets that quote and trade in Nasdaq-listed securities (all are members of the UTP
Plan). Second, in its role as a market, Nasdaq provides proprietary data products.


In
its role as the SIP, Nasdaq collects and disseminates quotation and last sale information for all transactions in securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. In creating the
national market system, Congress intended for participants in U.S. securities markets to have access to a consolidated stream of quotation and transaction information for the exchanges and The Nasdaq
Stock Market. To accomplish this objective, the SIP consolidates information with respect to quotations and transactions in order to increase information availability and thus create the opportunity
for a more transparent and effective market.

Nasdaq
is currently the exclusive SIP pursuant to the UTP Plan. Under the UTP Plan, each participant can quote and trade any security listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. Nasdaq collects
quotation and last sale information from competing exchanges (currently the Amex, the Chicago Stock Exchange, the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, the NASD's ADF and the Pacific Stock Exchange) and
consolidates such information with the information for all the securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market.

As
the SIP, Nasdaq sells this information to vendors in exchange for Tape Fees, and the data vendors in turn sell the last sale and quotation data publicly. Under the revenue sharing
provision of the UTP Plan, Nasdaq is permitted to deduct certain costs associated with acting as an exclusive SIP from the total amount of Tape Fees collected. After these costs are deducted from the
Tape Fees, Nasdaq distributes to the respective UTP Plan participants, including Nasdaq, their share of Tape Fees based on a combination of their respective trade volume and share volume.

Currently,
the NASD is the official participant of record in the UTP Plan; however, the NASD has delegated voting authority to Nasdaq pursuant to the Delegation Plan for all UTP Plan
matters. In anticipation of Exchange Registration, UTP Plan participants have submitted to the SEC an amendment to the UTP Plan that would, among other things, make Nasdaq a direct participant in the
UTP Plan.

While
Nasdaq is currently the exclusive SIP for the UTP Plan, it is engaged with the other UTP Plan participants in selecting a new SIP. This process is the result of the SEC's
conditions for extending the UTP Plan beyond its March 2001 termination date. Nasdaq does not expect its net operating income to be affected if it no longer serves as a SIP because all SIP
revenues are passed on to UTP Plan participants based on a combination of their trade volume and share volume (after deducting operating expenses). Any reduction in Nasdaq's total revenue since it
will no longer be reimbursed for operating expenses is expected to be largely offset by a reduction in Nasdaq's actual expenses since it will no longer operate the UTP Plan.

The
SEC has required that there be good faith negotiations among the UTP Plan participants on a revised UTP Plan that provides for either (i) a fully viable alternative exclusive
SIP for all securities listed on The Nasdaq National Market, or (ii) a fully viable alternative non-exclusive SIP. To avoid conflicts of interest, the SEC cautioned that, in the
event the revised UTP Plan provides for an exclusive SIP, a UTP Plan participant—particularly Nasdaq—should not operate as the exclusive SIP unless (i) the SIP is chosen
on the basis of bona fide competitive bidding and the participant submits the successful bid, and (ii) any decision to award a contract to a UTP Plan participant, and any ensuing renewal of
such contract, is made without that UTP Plan participant's direct or indirect voting participation. The UTP Plan participants unanimously approved the Request-for-Proposal on
November 7, 2001. The Request-for-Proposal was mailed to prospective bidders, and eight bidders submitted proposals. Nasdaq did not submit a bid proposal. The UTP Plan
participants have selected the proposal of the Cicada Corporation, in conjunction with the Sprint Corporation, as the leading candidate. The UTP Plan Participants are currently negotiating with Cicada
to enter into an agreement for Cicada to succeed Nasdaq as the exclusive SIP to the Nasdaq UTP Plan.

Nasdaq
and the other UTP Plan participants earn revenue from two SIP market information products. These products are designed to provide the varying levels of detail desired by different


broker-dealers and their customers. The first product is known as Level 1. This product provides subscribers with the current national BBO and most recent price at which the last sale or purchase was
transacted for a specific security as well as the BBO from each exchange or market trading stocks listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. Professional subscribers (e.g., broker-dealers and other employees
of broker-dealers) to this product pay a monthly fee per terminal for the service, which is typically delivered to the subscriber through a third-party data vendor. A vendor or a broker-dealer can
provide non-professional customers (such as individual investors), with Level 1 information at a reduced fee calculated on a per query basis or a flat monthly fee per user. Weaker economic
and market conditions in the last two years caused a substantial reduction in Level 1 revenue due to a decrease in demand for professional and non-professional per query service. The
termination of Nasdaq's role as SIP will not affect Nasdaq's share of Level 1 revenue.

For
the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, Nasdaq's revenue from Level 1 fees was $142.3 million, $161.8 million and $190.5 million, respectively.
Nasdaq's Level 1 fees accounted for approximately 17.8% of Nasdaq's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Currently,
the second SIP market information product, the Nasdaq Quotation Dissemination Service ("NQDS"), provides subscribers with the BBO from each individual Nasdaq market maker and
ECN and, through March 2003, also includes the BBO from each of the UTP Plan exchanges and markets trading Nasdaq-listed securities. All NQDS subscribers also subscribe to Level 1 to obtain
consolidated UTP Plan and Nasdaq inside quotes and last transaction information. The fee for this service is priced on a per- terminal per month basis, with professional subscribers paying
a higher monthly per terminal fee than non-professional customers. Weaker economic and market conditions and cost cutting by market participants caused a decline in NQDS professional
subscriptions partially offset by growth in non-professional subscriptions in the fourth quarter of 2002.

Nasdaq
intends to remove other UTP Plan exchanges from the NQDS data product in March 2003 and, upon Exchange Registration, NQDS will become a proprietary Nasdaq data product.
Also upon Exchange Registration, the SIP will no longer administer NQDS and Nasdaq will no longer share related revenue with UTP Plan participants.

For
the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, Nasdaq's revenue from NQDS fees was $37.5 million, $43.4 million and $47.3 million, respectively. NQDS
fees accounted for approximately 4.7% of Nasdaq's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Nasdaq,
in its role as a stock market, has launched three new proprietary data products in conjunction with the launch of SuperMontage. SuperMontage has expanded Nasdaq's ability to
offer market data to market participants that choose to display trading interest on Nasdaq that goes beyond the BBO. These new data products: Nasdaq DepthView,

SM

PowerView,

SM

and TotalView

SM

(collectively referred to as the "ViewSuite" products), offer a wide array of quotation information to market data vendors and broker-dealer
distributors. DepthView shows the aggregate size, by price level, of all Nasdaq market participants' quotations/orders that are in the top five price levels in SuperMontage. PowerView bundles NQDS and
DepthView. TotalView offers the PowerView services and shows all Nasdaq market participants' quotations/orders that are in the top five price levels in SuperMontage, in addition to the aggregate size
of all unattributed (i.e., providing pre-trade anonymity) quotes/orders at each of the top five price levels.

Each
of DepthView, PowerView and TotalView is offered through distributors to professional subscribers for a monthly fee per terminal and DepthView and PowerView are offered to
non-professional subscribers for a lower monthly fee per terminal. In addition, Nasdaq charges the distributor a monthly fee for each ViewSuite product. During 2003, Nasdaq is offering
nine-month ViewSuite incentive pricing plans to promote widespread distribution of the new data products. Subscribers to this offer will be able to provide DepthView, PowerView, and/or
TotalView to their entire Level-1 or NQDS populations for a reduced, fixed monthly fee.


On
March 18, 2002, Nasdaq began distributing Nasdaq PostData,

SM

which is a data product with several different services. Volume Post

SM

displays the
daily share volume figures of subscribing market participants for each Nasdaq-listed security for the prior trading day. Monthly Volume Summaries rank the top 50 market participants by industry
sector, security type, or total and block volume. Daily Issue Data provides a summary for every Nasdaq-listed security of the previous day's activity, including price, total shares outstanding and
dividend data. Nasdaq distributes PostData to data distributors for a per-subscriber charge, and to direct subscribers for a set fee. PostData provided less than 1% of Nasdaq's total
revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002.

For
the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, Nasdaq's total revenue from Market Information Services was $202.4 million, $243.9 million and
$261.7 million, respectively. Market Information Services accounted for approximately 25.3% of Nasdaq's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Corporate Client Group.

The Corporate Client Group provides customer support services and products to
Nasdaq-listed companies and is responsible for obtaining new listings on The Nasdaq Stock Market. The Nasdaq Stock Market has historically attracted traditional growth companies and, as of
December 31, 2002, was home to the highest percentage of publicly-traded technology and service companies in the U.S.

On
December 31, 2002, there were 3,659 companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. For the year ended December 31, 2002, 121 new companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock
Market, 86 on The Nasdaq National Market and 35 on The Nasdaq SmallCap Market. For the year ended December 31, 2001, 145 new companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market, 116 on The Nasdaq
National Market, and 29 on The Nasdaq SmallCap Market.

During
2002, 51 IPOs, approximately 56.7% of all IPOs on primary U.S. markets during this period, listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. These IPOs raised over $4.5 billion,
approximately 16.4% of the total dollar value raised in U.S. IPOs during this period. Of all U.S. IPOs during the year ended December 31, 2001, 63 companies, approximately 62% of U.S. IPOs
during this period, listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. The reduction in The Nasdaq Stock Market's percentage of U.S. IPOs during 2002 reflects a continued decline in general market and economic
conditions, which has impacted the ability of traditional growth companies to access the public equity markets over the last few years. In addition, 2002 continued a trend from the prior year in which
increasing numbers of IPOs are of companies being spun-off from public companies that, in general, have not operated in traditional growth industries. Of the 14 spin-offs of
public companies during 2002, 12 of the spin-offs were subsidiaries of NYSE-listed companies, 10 of which also listed on the NYSE. These 14 spin-offs accounted for
approximately 15.6% of all U.S. IPOs and approximately 44.2% of the total dollar value raised in U.S. IPOs during this period. While these figures were generally comparable to spin offs in
2001, the number of IPO spin-offs from public companies in 2000 accounted for only 5% of U.S. IPOs and approximately 13% of the total dollar value raised in U.S. IPOs during that period.
Forty-seven of the 51 IPOs that listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market during 2002 have listed on The Nasdaq National Market and four companies have listed on The Nasdaq SmallCap Market.

Companies
cease being listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market for three primary reasons: (i) the failure to meet The Nasdaq Stock Market's listing standards; (ii) the
consolidation of listings due to merger and acquisition activity; and (iii) Nasdaq-listed companies switching their listing to another stock market. See
"—Competition—Corporate Client Group."

For
the year ended December 31, 2002, 379 issuers ceased being listed on The Nasdaq National Market and 192 issuers ceased being listed on The Nasdaq SmallCap Market. By
comparison, 537 issuers ceased being listed on The Nasdaq National Market and 233 issuers ceased being listed on The Nasdaq SmallCap Market for the year ended December 31, 2001. Delistings in
2001 would have been higher but for a suspension by Nasdaq of the minimum bid price and market value of public float


listing requirement during the period September 26, 2001 until December 31, 2001. This suspension was in response to market uncertainty in the wake of the September 11, 2001
terrorist attacks. On January 2, 2002, the minimum bid price and market value of public float requirements were reinstated. The time periods for review of non-compliance, which are
discussed below, began on January 2, 2002 for all issuers, including those that were not in compliance with the requirements as of September 26, 2001.

For
the year ended December 31, 2002, 139 issuers on The Nasdaq National Market and 141 issuers on The Nasdaq SmallCap Market were delisted by Nasdaq for failure to satisfy
listing standards; 42 issuers on The Nasdaq National Market and four issuers on The Nasdaq SmallCap Market were delisted as a result of switches to a competing market; and 198 issuers on The Nasdaq
National Market and 47 issuers on The Nasdaq SmallCap Market ceased being listed for other reasons, including mergers and acquisitions. An additional 229 issuers transferred from one tier of The
Nasdaq Stock Market to the other tier. The large majority of these transfers between tiers were companies moving from The Nasdaq National Market to The Nasdaq SmallCap Market due to a change in
Nasdaq's listing standards permitting issuers that no longer meet the requirements of The Nasdaq National Market to phase down to The Nasdaq SmallCap Market, as discussed in more detail below.

The
rules concerning the delisting of issuers from The Nasdaq Stock Market for failure to satisfy the minimum bid price requirement were amended in March 2003. An issuer is
subject to delisting if its security falls below the minimum bid price requirement for 30 business days. Under a pilot program scheduled to expire on January 1, 2005, issuers listed on The
Nasdaq National Market have 180 days to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement and are thereafter permitted to phase-down to The Nasdaq SmallCap Market. The pilot
program also provides issuers listed on The Nasdaq SmallCap Market with 180 days to regain compliance, which may be extended for up to 270 days if the issuer complies with certain other
initial listing requirements for The Nasdaq SmallCap Market. In addition to the pilot program, Nasdaq permanently changed the minimum continued listing bid price requirement for issuers listed on The
Nasdaq National Market from $3 to $1 if the issuers meet certain qualifications for continued listing on the National Market.

Nasdaq
charges issuers an initial listing fee, a listing of additional shares ("LAS") fee, and an annual fee. The initial listing fee for securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market
includes a listing application fee and a total shares outstanding fee. The estimated service period for initial listing fees is six years. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
Nasdaq's revenue from initial listing fees was $33.6 million, $35.7 million and $33.9 million, respectively. Nasdaq's initial listing fee revenue accounted for approximately 4.2%
of Nasdaq's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002.

The
fee for LAS is based on the total shares outstanding, which Nasdaq reviews quarterly. The estimated service period for LAS fees is four years. For the years ended December 31,
2002, 2001 and 2000, Nasdaq's revenue from LAS fees was $37.5 million, $35.9 million and $33.6 million, respectively. Nasdaq's LAS fee revenue accounted for approximately 4.7% of
Nasdaq's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Annual
fees for securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market are based on total shares outstanding. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, Nasdaq's revenue from
annual listing fees was $102.8 million, $83.1 million and $81.1 million, respectively. Nasdaq's annual listing fees accounted for approximately 12.9% of Nasdaq's total revenue for
the year ended December 31, 2002.

Nasdaq
has instituted a new fee structure that increased initial and annual listing fees for companies on The Nasdaq National Market (effective January 1, 2002) and The Nasdaq
SmallCap Market (effective January 1, 2002 and revised January 1, 2003). The revenue generated from the fee increases has been used in part to fund enhancements to the services offered
to Nasdaq-listed companies, including the establishment of a Market Intelligence Desk.

SM


Following
the initial listing, Nasdaq provides customer support services, products, and programs to Nasdaq-listed companies. In 2002, Nasdaq created the Market Intelligence Desk, a
"one-stop-shop" for information that provides rapid response to corporate client queries from a centralized location. The Market Intelligence Desk personnel use computer-aided
telephony and proprietary and non-proprietary information services to provide support to senior executives and board members of Nasdaq-listed companies. Each Nasdaq-listed company has a
private toll-free line to access the Market Intelligence Desk. Executives of Nasdaq-listed companies also are invited to participate in a variety of programs on a wide range of topics,
such as industry sector-specific seminars and investor relation forums. These executives also have access to Nasdaq Online,

SM

a strategic planning tool provided free of charge to
Nasdaq-listed companies that was rated number one in a recent survey of the top 10 favorite investor relations web sites by the National Investor Relations Institute. Nasdaq Online presents market
data on all U.S. traded companies and real-time quotes for Nasdaq-listed securities, as well as information on institutional ownership, research coverage and performance ratios. This
combination of on-line real time data and analytical information, along with a series of other seminars and programs, is designed to help management of listed companies make better equity
management decisions. A product group has been
established to begin the development and commercialization of new products and services focused on the corporate market, as well as increased financial newsmedia coverage of Nasdaq-listed companies.

Each
Nasdaq-listed company is assigned a Corporate Client Group director who oversees the listed company's relationship with Nasdaq. A schedule of calls and visits along with invitations
to various industry and market forums are used to enhance customer satisfaction, keep companies informed of new developments at Nasdaq and discuss the benefits of a listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market.
Nasdaq also has created a program to educate investment bankers, capital market dealers, institutional investors and other constituencies that influence listing decisions.

For
the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, Nasdaq's total revenue from the Corporate Client Group was $176.7 million, $156.1 million and
$149.3 million, respectively. The Corporate Client Group accounted for approximately 22.1% of Nasdaq's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Other Products and Markets

Nasdaq Financial Products.

Nasdaq Financial Products is responsible for introducing products that
extend and enhance the Nasdaq brand. The department oversees the development and marketing of new Nasdaq financial products and associated derivatives, the licensing and listing of third-party
structured products and the listing of third-party-sponsored exchange traded funds ("ETF"s). These products increase investments in companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market and this can contribute
to revenue for Nasdaq's Transaction Services, Market Information Services and Corporate Client Group LAS revenues.

Launched
in January 1985, the Nasdaq-100 Index® includes the largest, top 100 non-financial companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. It is
the benchmark for about 30 domestic and international mutual funds and more than 120 structured investment products in 28 countries. A structured product is a specialized security designed to respond
to specific investment objectives, such as risk reduction, leverage or diversification of current investments or tax management.

The
Nasdaq-100 Index Tracking Stock

SM

("QQQ"

SM

), the ETF based on the Nasdaq-100 Index, began trading in 1999 under the symbol QQQ. An
ETF is an investment company organized to track an index and to allow for secondary market trading. For the year ended December 31, 2002, QQQ's average daily share volume was
88.7 million and its average daily dollar volume was approximately $2.6 billion. QQQ is the most actively traded ETF in the world and the most heavily traded stock in the U.S. in terms
of dollar volume. As of December 31, 2002, the QQQ Trust had issued approximately


696 million shares and the assets under management had reached $17 billion. QQQ's equity options were also among the most heavily traded options in the U.S. in 2002.

Major
stock markets in the U.S., including the NYSE, Amex, Boston Stock Exchange, Chicago Stock Exchange, Cincinnati Stock Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, have been
licensed by Nasdaq to use Nasdaq trademarks in connection with trading QQQ under the UTP Plan. Every major options market in the U.S. has also been licensed by Nasdaq to use Nasdaq trademarks to trade
the equity options on QQQ. Nasdaq receives license fees for its trademark licenses that vary by product based on assets under management or number of contracts issued. In addition to license fees,
Nasdaq is entitled to reimbursement from the QQQ Trust for marketing activities designed to promote the Trust.

In
November 2002, Nasdaq Europe S.A./N.V. listed and began trading the Nasdaq-100 European Tracker

SM

("EQQQ"

SM

)—a product based
on the same stocks that are included in the QQQ. EQQQ is managed by Nasdaq Financial Product Services (Ireland), Limited, administered by AIB/BNY Fund Management (Ireland), Ltd., with AIB/BNY
Trust Company, Ltd. as its Custodian. As of December 2002, EQQQ was registered in the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, and Ireland with anticipated registrations in Italy and
Switzerland.

Also
in November 2002, BLDRS

SM

, a new family of ETFs based on The Bank of New York ADR Indexes,

SM

were listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. The BLDRS
Funds were the first ETFs listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market and the first ETFs based on American Depositary Receipts ("ADRs"). The Bank of New York serves as trustee and index provider of these Funds.

For
the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 Nasdaq's total revenue from Nasdaq Financial Products was $28.1 million, $30.6 million and $11.7 million,
respectively. Nasdaq Financial Products accounted for approximately 3.5% of Nasdaq's total revenue for the period ended December 31, 2002.

Nasdaq InterMarket.

The Nasdaq InterMarket is an electronic marketplace composed of NASD members that
quote and trade securities listed on the NYSE and Amex. Users can trade on Nasdaq InterMarket among themselves using Nasdaq's CAES order delivery system, or with another participating stock exchange
through the Intermarket Trading System. CAES, a trading system that is very similar to Nasdaq's former SuperSoes trading system, allows broker-dealers to enter and execute trades via the Nasdaq
Workstation II, an application programming interface or CTCI. Market makers and order entry firms can use CAES to enter marketable limit orders and market orders for automatic response and automatic
execution. The Intermarket Trading System allows market markers to trade with exchange specialists. Users may also internalize orders within their own systems and report that trade to Nasdaq
InterMarket.

For
the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, Nasdaq's total revenue from Nasdaq InterMarket was $38.6 million, $32.5 million and $21.9 million,
respectively. Nasdaq InterMarket revenue accounted for approximately 4.8% of Nasdaq's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002. Approximately 94.6% of the revenue generated from the
Nasdaq InterMarket is derived from the sale of data and is included in Market Information Services revenue, and the remaining revenue is derived from transaction service fees for CAES and Intermarket
Trading System transactions and included in Transaction Services revenue.

All
Nasdaq InterMarket trades are reported and disseminated in real-time to the Consolidated Tape Association, and as such, Nasdaq shares in the Tape Fees generated by the
Consolidated Tape Association. Two NASD members that are major market makers and one ECN report the majority of trades. Other ECNs report trades through Nasdaq systems to the Consolidated Tape
Association or to other Intermarket Trading System participants, such as regional exchanges. NASD members who trade exchange-listed securities away from the exchanges account for a significant amount
of Nasdaq


InterMarket trading activity. Nasdaq shares a portion of the Tape Fees received for Nasdaq InterMarket transactions with InterMarket participants.

In
anticipation of Exchange Registration, Nasdaq has been negotiating with participants in the Consolidated Tape Association and the Intermarket Trading System for admission into those
plans as a separate SRO. Nasdaq may be required to pay a fee, which has yet to be determined, for admission into the Consolidated Tape Association. After Exchange Registration, Nasdaq InterMarket will
likely continue to trade securities listed on the NYSE and Amex in much the same manner as it does today with the exception that it may no longer be permitted to accept trade reports that are at an
inferior price to the quotations of other market centers. Nasdaq's inability to accept such trade reports may decrease Nasdaq's percentage of trades and volume in these securities, reducing Nasdaq's
revenues.

Nasdaq Europe S.A./N.V.

In March 2001, Nasdaq acquired an approximate 68.2% ownership interest
in the European Association of Securities Dealers S.A./N.V. ("EASDAQ"), a pan-European stock market headquartered in Brussels. Nasdaq has since diluted its interest through the
introduction of other strategic partners as shareholders. In connection with this investment, Nasdaq renamed EASDAQ as Nasdaq Europe S.A./N.V. ("Nasdaq Europe") as part of a plan to restructure it
into a globally-linked pan-European market. As of December 31, 2002, Nasdaq owned approximately a 59.4% interest in Nasdaq Europe. As of December 31, 2002, 40 companies were
listed on Nasdaq Europe and eight companies were admitted for trading. The average monthly turnover volume on Nasdaq Europe during 2002 was €26.2 million. In
October 2002, Nasdaq Europe successfully launched SuperMontage Europe, that is based on the same principles as SuperMontage in the U.S., customized to European trading practices.

Nasdaq
Europe is investigating strategic partnership opportunities with foreign securities exchanges and other market participants to expand its leadership in technology-driven price
discovery systems and to utilize its brand recognition. On October 30, 2002, Nasdaq Europe, and the Berlin and Bremen Stock Exchanges, as well as comdirekt bank, Commerzbank and Dresdner Bank,
signed definitive agreements to recapitalize Bremen Wertpapierbörse AG ("BWB AG"), a German stock exchange, that will be
rebranded as "Nasdaq Deutschland AG" and that will be marketed under the Nasdaq brand. Nasdaq Deutschland began trading in German and international blue chip and growth stocks on March 21,
2003. Nasdaq Europe will initially hold a 50% equity stake, Dresdner Bank will hold a 15% equity stake, comdirekt bank and Commerzbank will each hold a 7.5% equity stake, and the Berlin and Bremen
Stock Exchanges will each hold a 10% equity stake. See also "Consolidated Financial Statements—Notes 2 and 17." Nasdaq anticipates that discussions with other foreign institutions will
continue, but cannot predict the results of any such discussions.

Nasdaq
Europe is still in its nascent stages and has generated only operating losses since the acquisition by Nasdaq. Nasdaq Europe's future growth is dependent on such things as firms
connecting to Nasdaq Europe's trading platform and using its trading facilities, as well as a reversal of the current weakness in European equity markets. Nasdaq Europe's main competitors for listings
and trading include the three primary exchanges in Europe: Deutsche Börse AG, Euronext N.V. and the London Stock Exchange. See "—Risk Factors—Nasdaq may not be
successful in executing its international strategy."

Nasdaq Japan.

In 1999, the NASD and SOFTBANK Corp. of Japan entered into a joint venture,
subsequently named Nasdaq Japan, to develop an electronic stock market in Japan. The NASD later transferred its interest in Nasdaq Japan to Nasdaq Global Holdings, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nasdaq,
which operated the market as a new market section of the Osaka Securities Exchange (the "OSE"). On August 16, 2002, the Board of Directors of Nasdaq Japan voted to take the company to dormant
status, effectively ceasing operations. Shareholders of Nasdaq Japan subsequently ratified this decision. Nasdaq Japan currently is in liquidation and is expected to be completely dissolved in the
second quarter of 2003. Companies listed on the Nasdaq Japan Market retained their listing on the


OSE and experienced no disruption to trading. See "Consolidated Financial Statements—Notes 2 and 8."

Nasdaq Liffe Markets, LLC.

On June 1, 2001, Nasdaq and the London International Financial
Futures and Options Exchange ("LIFFE"), a member of the Euronext (N.V.) Group, formed Nasdaq Liffe Markets, LLC ("NQLX"), a U.S. joint venture company in which Nasdaq owns a 50% interest. On
November 8, 2002, NQLX began listing futures contracts on individual equity securities with 43 members. As of December 31, 2002, NQLX had traded in total approximately 125,000 contracts
on 24 security futures products, 20 individual equity securities and four exchange traded funds. Through the end of 2002, NQLX operated under a fee holiday during which NQLX had no revenue. This fee
holiday ended on March 1, 2003. Nasdaq accounts for its investment in NQLX under the equity method of accounting.

Nasdaq Insurance Agency, LLC.

On December 31, 2002, Nasdaq purchased the NASD's 50% interest
in The NASD Insurance Agency, LLC, subsequently renamed The Nasdaq Insurance Agency, LLC ("NIA"). AIG NJV, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of American International Group, Inc., owns the
other 50% interest in NIA. NIA provides insurance brokerage services and specializes in the directors and officers liability insurance market. Nasdaq accounts for its investment in NIA under the
equity method of accounting.

OTC Bulletin Board.

The OTC Bulletin Board is an electronic screen-based market for equity securities
that, among other things, are not listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market or any primary U.S. national securities exchange. At present, the OTC Bulletin Board is only a quotation service without any
execution facilities. Companies do not list on the OTC Bulletin Board; rather, NASD members may post quotes only for companies that file periodic reports with the SEC and/or with a banking or
insurance regulatory authority. In addition, these companies are required to be current with their periodic filings. Market makers are charged a fee per position and are billed based on their number
of positions during a month. A position is defined as any price quotation or indication of interest entered by a market maker in a security quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. There are no fees charged
to companies whose securities are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. The OTC Bulletin Board revenue accounted for less than 1% of Nasdaq's total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively. Revenue generated from the OTC Bulletin Board is included in Transaction Services revenue.

In
conjunction with the process of seeking Exchange Registration, the Nasdaq Board of Directors and the NASD Board of Governors (collectively, the "Boards"), approved several rule
changes that are designed to replace the OTC Bulletin Board with a new listed market that will be called the "BBX." First, the Boards approved a program for Nasdaq to enter into a listing agreement
with future BBX issuers (which will be primarily drawn from existing OTC Bulletin Board companies) and impose listing standards to ensure the quality of these issuers. Second, both Boards approved the
creation of automated order delivery and execution systems for the BBX. Finally, to accompany the new listing standards and order delivery system, the Boards approved enhanced market rules that
include limit order protection, short interest reporting, and intraday trading halt authority. Nasdaq plans to submit exemption requests that would allow Nasdaq to continue to operate the OTC Bulletin
Board for a limited period after Exchange Registration, with the OTC Bulletin Board to be phased out six months after the BBX is launched. The SEC has not yet approved the rules or the exemption
request. Therefore, it is not certain whether Nasdaq will continue to operate the OTC Bulletin Board following Exchange Registration or will be able to launch the BBX. If the SEC does not approve the
exemption request, these securities could continue to trade over the counter through a non-Nasdaq facility after Exchange Registration.


Fee Changes

Nasdaq may change the pricing of its products and services in response to competitive pressures or changes in market or general economic conditions. Pursuant to
the requirements of the Exchange Act, Nasdaq must file all proposals for a change in its pricing structure with the SEC. Nasdaq provides updated information on the pricing of its products and services
on its website at

www.nasdaqtrader.com

.

Information on Nasdaq's website is not a part of this Form 10-K. See also
"—Competition" and "—Risk Factors-Competition by regional exchanges and the ADF may reduce Nasdaq's transactions, trade reporting and market information revenue and impact the
ability of SuperMontage to increase Nasdaq's market share of transactions in Nasdaq-listed securities."

Technology

Nasdaq believes that the effective use of technology is the key to the future of financial markets. The Nasdaq Stock Market was the world's first electronic
screen-based stock market and its use of state-of-the-art computer networking, telecommunications and information technologies distinguishes it from other U.S.
securities markets. Using technology, Nasdaq eliminates the need for a physical trading floor and enables qualified investors across the country to compete freely with one another in an electronic
screen-based environment. The Nasdaq network has handled trade volumes of over two billion shares daily and over 4,000 transactions per second and is designed to maximize transaction reliability and
network security across each of the most critical system services that comprise The Nasdaq Stock Market, including quotation, order processing, trade reporting and market data dissemination.
Furthermore, Nasdaq's system has substantial reserve capacity to handle far greater levels of activity and will further expand bandwidth to maximize its ability to provide an efficient, rapid,
reliable trading environment for its market participants. Continual systems improvements provide cost effective and efficient access to multiple market information data and rapid market response
capabilities. Nasdaq also employs technology to maximize its ability to communicate with investors, issuers, traders, the media and others.

Competition

The securities markets are intensely competitive and they are expected to remain so. Nasdaq competes both domestically and globally and on a product and/or
specific geographical basis. Nasdaq competes based on a number of factors, including the quality of its technological and regulatory infrastructure, total transaction costs, the depth and breadth of
its markets, the quality of its value-added customer services (e.g., services to listed companies), reputation and price. In the U.S., Nasdaq is one of the leaders in each of its principal businesses.
Nonetheless, Nasdaq expects that current or new markets and exchanges will continue to compete aggressively against Nasdaq.

In
addition, Nasdaq has formed alliances in certain key financial centers around the world as part of a strategy to build on its strong, worldwide brand name. Nevertheless, most of
Nasdaq's competitors overseas are currently larger and have a longer operating history in their markets than does Nasdaq.

In
light of recent technological and regulatory changes and new product introductions, Nasdaq expects to compete with a number of different entities varying in size, business objectives,
and strategy.

Transaction Services.

Nasdaq's core trading services are designed to provide access to The Nasdaq
Stock Market, execution services that are designed to provide quoting and trading capabilities and reporting services such as trade reporting and risk management. Nasdaq expects to face competition
from a number of different sources in providing these services including:

•

Market
participants that have been, or have announced plans to begin, reporting trades to competing regional stock exchanges and the ADF rather than to
Nasdaq, thereby reducing both Transaction Services and Market Information Services revenue. See "—Risk Factors—


Competition
by regional exchanges and the ADF may reduce Nasdaq's transactions, trade reporting and market information revenue and impact the ability of SuperMontage to increase Nasdaq's market share
of transactions in Nasdaq-listed securities;"

•

ECNs
that have been consolidating to form larger service providers. During 2002, Island ECN ("Island") and Instinet merged to form the largest ECN and two of
the largest users of ACT for trade reporting, Archipelago and RediBook, merged. Any continued consolidation that created a dominant service provider could diminish Nasdaq's competitive position;

•

ECNs
that obtain registration as exchanges and compete for Transaction Services and Market Information Services, and potentially, for listings. Recently, the
Pacific Stock Exchange established the Archipelago Exchange as its equities trading facility. Archipelago began quoting and reporting certain of its trades to the Archipelago Exchange in
February 2003. Island, another ECN, has applied to the SEC for registration as a national securities exchange. See "—Risk Factors—Nasdaq's revenue would be adversely
affected by ECNs that register as exchanges;"

•

Competing
stock exchanges that are permitted by the SEC to regulate trading in their markets at a lower cost than Nasdaq. As a result they may be able to
attract order flow from The Nasdaq Stock Market to the other exchanges because of such lower regulatory costs; and

•

Companies
that could provide trading services for products and services, including software companies, information and media companies and other companies
that are not currently in the securities business.

To
address competitive concerns, Nasdaq has looked to enhance its technology and the services it provides to its market participants and refine its pricing approach by reviewing each
component of its Transaction Services, including access services, execution services and trade reporting services. For each component, Nasdaq has attempted to make pricing more attractive in order to
retain usage of its services. In addition, Nasdaq has enhanced its execution services through the implementation of SuperMontage and related products.

Market Information Services.

Nasdaq's Market Information Services revenue is under competitive threat
from other securities exchanges that trade Nasdaq-listed securities, including the established regional exchanges and the ADF. Current SEC regulations permit these regional exchanges and the ADF to
quote and trade certain securities that are not listed on a national securities exchange, including securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market, pursuant to the UTP Plan. Nasdaq's UTP Plan entitles
these exchanges and the ADF to a share of UTP Plan Tape Fees, in proportion to such exchange's share of trading as measured by share volume and number of trades. Currently, the Amex, the Chicago Stock
Exchange, the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, the ADF, and the Pacific Exchange quote and trade Nasdaq-listed securities pursuant to the UTP Plan. The Boston Stock Exchange and Philadelphia Stock Exchange
have indicated their intent to commence trading in Nasdaq-listed securities pursuant to the UTP Plan. In the past, participants in the UTP Plan have established payment for order flow arrangements
with their members and customers through sharing tape revenue.

The
net effect of these additional competitors, along with continuing advances in technology and regulatory changes may increase competitive pressure on Nasdaq. In February 2002,
Island began reporting its trades to the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, a UTP Plan participant. Published reports indicate that the Cincinnati Stock Exchange gained Island's business by committing to
lower trade reporting fees and share with Island a substantial portion of Tape Fees that Cincinnati earns from Island's trades. In July 2002 the SEC abrogated all member tape sharing
arrangements by UTP Plan participants for securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. While certain UTP Plan participants have filed revised Tape Fee sharing proposals for Nasdaq-listed securities
with the SEC, no proposals have yet been approved by the SEC. Nasdaq's revenue would be further affected if UTP Plan participants obtain SEC approval to begin sharing tape revenues with their members
and customers.


Nasdaq historically has used Tape Fees to pay market regulation expenses that help ensure the quality and fairness of The Nasdaq Stock Market and compliance with all applicable rules and
regulations. Despite this imperative, Nasdaq reduced certain trade reporting fees and began sharing Tape Fees with participants during 2002. Nasdaq's Tape Fee sharing program was abrogated along with
all others in July 2002. To remain competitive, Nasdaq's trade reporting fees or Tape Fee sharing may be adjusted in the future to respond to competitive pressures. See "—Risk
Factors—Competition by regional exchanges and the ADF may reduce Nasdaq's transactions, trade reporting and market information revenue and impact the ability of SuperMontage to increase
Nasdaq's market share of transactions in Nasdaq-listed securities" and "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Business
Environment—2003 Outlook."

ECNs
pose an additional potential challenge to Nasdaq's Market Information Services business because they may register as securities exchanges. As noted above, the Archipelago Exchange
has been established as the equities trading facility of the Pacific Exchange and Island, now merged with Instinet, has applied for exchange registration and expressed interest in becoming a UTP Plan
participant. In this case, they would be eligible for a share of the UTP Plan Tape Fees generated by the sale of Nasdaq's market information products, and their use of Nasdaq's systems could diminish.
See "—Risk Factors—Nasdaq's revenue would be adversely affected by ECNs that register as exchanges."

Nasdaq
is responding aggressively to competition from existing and potential UTP Plan exchanges. Nasdaq is working to ensure that all exchanges are covered by uniform regulatory
standards and bear appropriate regulatory costs. Nasdaq also regularly examines its fee structure to insure that costs are fairly distributed among participants and that fees adequately cover the cost
of regulation. Nasdaq has also introduced several new data products that are designed to provide market participants with new and more extensive market information, and to provide Nasdaq with new
revenue streams. See "—Market Information Services."

Corporate Client Group.

Nasdaq's strategies for maintaining its current listings in both The Nasdaq
National Market and The Nasdaq SmallCap Market and gaining new listings include building global brand identity, developing joint marketing opportunities with listed companies, communicating better
with key decision makers and providing other value-added services to Nasdaq-listed companies. Nasdaq's marketing efforts have centered on creating a valuable brand—an important factor in
attracting and retaining large world-class growth companies.

In
terms of obtaining new listings, Nasdaq will continue to focus its efforts primarily on growth companies. Over the last three years, general market and economic conditions have made
it difficult for
many companies to access the public equity markets. Nevertheless, Nasdaq believes that its market model, strong global reputation and value-added services will enable it to compete successfully for
listings. Nasdaq employs a variety of initiatives and tools in its marketing efforts, including media advertising, Internet publishing (Nasdaq.com) and international road shows.

Nasdaq
competes primarily with the NYSE for larger company listings on The Nasdaq National Market. As of December 31, 2002, there were 2,824 companies listed on The Nasdaq
National Market with an aggregate domestic market capitalization of $1.9 trillion compared to 2,783 companies listed on the NYSE with an aggregate domestic market capitalization of $9.0 trillion.
Rule 500 of the NYSE historically has made it very difficult for companies to voluntarily delist from the NYSE. As currently written, Rule 500 allows a company to delist from the NYSE if
it obtains the approval of its board of directors and its audit committee, publishes a press release announcing its proposed delisting and sends a written notice to its largest 35 stockholders of
record (U.S. stockholders of record if a non-U.S. issuer) alerting them to the proposed delisting. Because of these affirmative steps imposed on an issuer's board of directors, in
particular the notice requirements, Nasdaq believes that Rule 500 is anti-competitive and continues to constitute an impediment to Nasdaq's ability to compete for NYSE


listings. During 2002, no companies transferred from the NYSE to The Nasdaq Stock Market, while 43 companies switched to the NYSE from The Nasdaq National Market.

Nasdaq
competes with Amex for listings on both The Nasdaq National Market and The Nasdaq SmallCap Market. During the year ended December 31, 2002, four companies transferred from
Amex to The Nasdaq National Market. During this period, three companies switched to Amex from The Nasdaq SmallCap Market. In addition, the Pacific Stock Exchange has announced that it intends in the
future to seek listings on its Archipelago Exchange. It is unclear at this time whether this type of market will become a significant competitor for Nasdaq.

Companies
also have a choice of not listing on any market. In that case, broker-dealers may still make markets for such securities and post their quotes on the OTC Bulletin Board or the
Pink Sheets, owned by Pink Sheets LLC, a private company.

Other Markets.

The Nasdaq Stock Market competes for trading volume in NYSE and
Amex-listed securities by offering customers quality trade executions at a reasonable price and derives revenue from the sale of related data. A significant amount of investor
self-directed, on-line trading activity in listed securities is currently executed on Nasdaq InterMarket. These orders forgo the exposure of the auction trading systems of the
exchanges in favor of the execution services provided by Nasdaq InterMarket participants.

Nasdaq
InterMarket has implemented a program designed to lower costs for Nasdaq InterMarket participants executing trades through Nasdaq facilities. The program allows Nasdaq InterMarket
participants to share in the Tape Fees Nasdaq receives as a participant in the Consolidated Tape Association Plan.

Employees

As of March 1, 2003, Nasdaq had 1,290 employees. None of its employees is subject to collective bargaining agreements or is represented by a union. Nasdaq
considers its relations with its employees to be good.

Nasdaq Website and Availability of SEC Filings

Service, Regulatory and Technology Contractual Relationships with the NASD, NASDR and Amex

Although it is contemplated that the NASD will eventually divest completely its ownership interest in Nasdaq, there may still exist certain contractual
relationships between the parties once this happens. For example, prior to the Restructuring, Nasdaq had access to many support functions of the NASD, including certain financial services, real
estate, legal, information services and corporate and administrative services. The NASD and Nasdaq entered into a Separation and Common Services Agreement, dated as of January 1, 2002 (the "New
Separation Agreement"), which replaced an interim Separation and Common Services Agreement executed in 2000 (the "Interim Agreement"). The services to be provided to Nasdaq by the NASD under the New
Separation Agreement are limited to certain finance, technology infrastructure, facilities sharing and legal, which is substantially more limited than what was previously provided by the NASD under
the Interim Agreement. Under the New


Separation Agreement, Nasdaq pays to the NASD the costs of the services provided, including any incidental expenses associated with such services. Nasdaq's costs for services provided by the NASD in
2002 were approximately $5.1 million. Nasdaq anticipates that the annual costs for services under the New Separation Agreement will drop in future years as Nasdaq reviews the provision of these
services and continues to internalize more of these services or seeks alternative third party providers. See "—Risk Factors—Lack of operating history as for-profit entity and
potential conflicts of interest with related parties," "—Risk Factors—The intercompany agreements may not be effected on terms as favorable to Nasdaq as could have been
obtained from unaffiliated third parties" and "Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions."

On
June 28, 2000, Nasdaq and NASD Regulation, Inc. ("NASDR"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the NASD, signed a Regulatory Services Agreement pursuant to which NASDR or its
subsidiaries would provide regulatory services to Nasdaq and its subsidiaries commencing upon the effectiveness of Exchange Registration. As a result, no services have been performed under this
agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Regulatory Services Agreement, the services provided will be of the same type and scope as are currently provided by NASDR to Nasdaq under the Delegation Plan
for a term of ten years. Each regulatory service is to be provided for a minimum of five years, after which time the parties may determine to terminate the provision by NASDR of a particular service.
The termination of a particular service will generally be based upon a review of pricing and the need for such services. In 2002, Nasdaq paid NASDR approximately $76.7 million for regulatory
services provided pursuant to the Delegation Plan.

On
February 6, 2002, Nasdaq, the NASD, and Amex entered into a Technology Transition Agreement to provide for the sharing of certain administrative and regulatory technologies
between Nasdaq and Amex and the provision of certain technology services by Nasdaq to Amex. This agreement replaces the existing technology arrangements among the parties that resulted from the NASD's
acquisition of Amex in 1998. Depending upon the applicable service or technology, the term of the agreement ranges between three months and two years while Amex reconstructs these services and
technologies in-house, with an option for Amex to extend the term for certain services for up to one year. Pursuant to this agreement, Amex will pay Nasdaq the direct costs of the services
provided by Nasdaq, plus certain administrative costs. In addition, this agreement establishes a fund, administered by the NASD, to pay the costs incurred by Nasdaq, the NASD and Amex in the
implementation of this agreement. Nasdaq and the NASD have each agreed to contribute up to $14.5 million to this fund.

The
parties also entered into a Master Agreement on February 6, 2002 to govern certain non-technology related matters among the parties and their respective
affiliates. This agreement, among other things, sets forth the terms of certain trading rights between Nasdaq and Amex. See "—Risk Factors—Lack of operating history as
for-profit entity and potential conflicts of interest with related parties," "—Risk Factors—The intercompany agreements may not be effected on terms as favorable to Nasdaq as
could have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties" and "Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions."

Risk Factors

This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Nasdaq's actual results could
differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks faced by Nasdaq described below and elsewhere in this
Form 10-K.

The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing Nasdaq. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Nasdaq or that Nasdaq
currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect Nasdaq's business. If any of the following risks actually occur, Nasdaq's business, financial condition, or operating results could be
materially adversely affected.

Nasdaq's operating results could fluctuate significantly in the future.

Nasdaq's operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, including: (i) a decrease in the trading volume
in The Nasdaq Stock Market; (ii) increased competition from regional exchanges, ECNs, the ADF or other alternative trading systems that might reduce market share and create pricing pressure;
(iii) competition from the NYSE or new competing exchanges for new listings; (iv) a reduction in market information revenue; (v) the rate at which The Nasdaq Stock Market obtains
new listings and maintains its current listings; (vi) regulatory changes and compliance costs; (vii) Nasdaq's ability to utilize its capital effectively; (viii) Nasdaq's ability
to manage personnel, overhead, and other expenses, in particular technology expenses; and (ix) general market and economic conditions.

Nasdaq's business could be harmed by market fluctuations and other risks associated with the securities industry generally.

A substantial portion of Nasdaq's revenue is tied to the trading volume of its listed securities. Trading volume is directly affected by economic and political
conditions, broad trends in business and finance, and changes in price levels of securities. A continuation of the weak economic conditions of the past several years or a worsening of the economy or
the securities markets could result in a further decline in trading volume. Nasdaq is also particularly affected by declines in trading volume in technology-related securities because a significant
portion of its customers trade in these types of securities and a large number of technology-related companies are listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. A decline in trading volume would lower revenue
from Transaction Services and Market Information Services, and
Nasdaq's profitability may be adversely affected if it is unable to reduce costs at the same rate. A continuation of the current downturn in the initial public offering market is also likely to have
an adverse effect on Nasdaq's revenue, including, in particular, revenue from listing fees. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2002, 51 IPOs were brought to market on The Nasdaq Stock
Market compared to 63 in the year ended December 31, 2001. There also were 571 companies delisted during 2002.

Substantial listing competition could reduce Nasdaq's revenue.

The Nasdaq Stock Market faces competition for listings from other primary exchanges, especially from the NYSE. In addition to competition for initial listings,
The Nasdaq Stock Market also competes with the NYSE to maintain listings. In the past, a number of issuers listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market have left for the NYSE each year. The largest 50
Nasdaq-listed issuers (based on U.S. market value) accounted for approximately 50.9% of total dollar volume traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market for the year ended December 31, 2002. While the
loss of one or more of these issuers would result in a decrease in revenue from Nasdaq's Corporate Client Group, such a loss would cause an even more


significant reduction in revenue from Nasdaq's Transaction Services and Market Information Services. The reduction in initial listings or the loss of a top issuer could have an adverse effect on
Nasdaq's business, financial condition, or operating results.

Competition by regional exchanges and the ADF may reduce Nasdaq's transactions, trade reporting and market information revenue and impact the ability of
SuperMontage to increase Nasdaq's market share of transactions in Nasdaq-listed securities.

Nasdaq has invested approximately $107 million in the design and implementation of its new trading system, SuperMontage, which was fully implemented on
December 2, 2002. SuperMontage is intended to attract more orders and quotes to The Nasdaq Stock Market by providing a more comprehensive system that will increase competition and market
transparency. SuperMontage has been launched into a competitive environment. Any decision by market participants to quote through regional exchanges or the ADF, as discussed below, could have a
negative impact on Nasdaq's share of quotes and trades in securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market and may adversely affect Nasdaq's business, financial condition, and operating results.

Nasdaq
is currently facing increased competition from regional exchanges for quoting and trade reporting business, which affects Transaction Services and Market Information Services
revenue. Island began reporting its trades to the Cincinnati Stock Exchange in February 2002, while another ECN, Archipelago, began quoting and reporting certain trades to the Archipelago
Exchange, the equities arm of the Pacific Stock Exchange, in February 2003. Nasdaq has taken several steps in response, including discussions with UTP Plan exchanges about how they can continue
to interact with SuperMontage (as the Chicago Stock Exchange does), adjusting our transactions pricing to be more competitive with ECNs that do not quote or report through Nasdaq, and working to make
functionality of
SuperMontage reflect the needs of ECNs that choose to remain in Nasdaq. These actions may not be sufficient to regain lost business or prevent other market participants from shifting some of their
trade reporting to regional exchanges. Nasdaq may be required to take further action to remain competitive.

As
a condition for its approval of SuperMontage, the SEC required the NASD to provide NASD members with the ability to opt-out of SuperMontage by providing the ADF as an
alternative quotation and trade reporting facility for NASD members. At least one ECN has been quoting through the ADF rather than through SuperMontage. The NASD recently reduced the fees it charges
for the ADF. Nasdaq has requested that the SEC abrogate this new fee schedule as inconsistent with the Exchange Act, however, there can be no assurance that the SEC will respond favorably to Nasdaq's
request. If additional market participants quote through the ADF, Nasdaq faces the risk of reduced market share in Transaction Services and Market Information Services revenue, which could adversely
affect Nasdaq's business, financial condition and operating results.

Nasdaq's revenue would be adversely affected by ECNs that register as exchanges.

The Pacific Stock Exchange has established the Archipelago Exchange as its equities trading facility. In addition, Island has applied to register as an exchange.
Exchanges that are UTP Plan participants are entitled to a share of Tape Fees. A proliferation in the number of exchanges and UTP Plan participants could have an adverse impact on Nasdaq's Transaction
Services and Market Information Services revenue if quoting, trading and trade reporting are fragmented across exchanges and marketplaces.

In
addition, new exchanges could adversely affect Nasdaq's revenue from listings. ECNs, unlike exchanges, historically have not provided listing venues. The Pacific Stock Exchange has
announced that the Archipelago Exchange intends to begin competing for listings. If more ECNs become exchanges and are successful in attracting listings, there can be no assurances that Nasdaq will be
able to maintain or increase its listing revenue. The reduction in initial listings or the loss of a top issuer could have an


adverse effect on Nasdaq's business, financial condition and operating results. See "—Substantial listing competition could reduce Nasdaq's revenue."

Substantial competition could reduce The Nasdaq Stock Market's market share and harm Nasdaq's financial performance.

It is possible that a competing securities exchange, network provider, or technology company could develop ways to replicate Nasdaq's network more efficiently
than Nasdaq and persuade a critical mass of market participants to switch to a new network.

If
there is an increase in the number of market makers or ECNs that determine they do enough order routing traffic to justify setting up a proprietary network for their traffic, Nasdaq
may be forced to alter its pricing structure or risk losing its share of the order routing or execution business. In addition, certain system providers link many market makers in The Nasdaq Stock
Market. These systems may be able to increase the number of orders executed through their systems versus the Nasdaq systems. A reduction in Nasdaq's order routing or execution business could have an
adverse effect on Nasdaq's business, financial condition and operating results.

The
traditional products and services offered by markets are being unbundled. Historically, Nasdaq has provided listings, execution services information services, and regulatory services
to the investing public. Currently, there are many competitors operating in the execution services market. Nasdaq has not historically implemented pricing strategies that isolate its various
businesses. Due to competition in the execution services business, as well as Nasdaq's past practice of bundling products and services, it is uncertain whether Nasdaq will be able to compete
successfully in this business. Furthermore, Nasdaq faces multiple pricing constraints, including in particular, regulatory constraints that may prevent it from competing effectively in certain
markets.

Nasdaq is subject to extensive regulation that may harm its ability to compete with less regulated entities.

Under current federal securities laws, changes in Nasdaq's rules and operations, including its pricing structure, must be approved by the SEC. The SEC may
approve, disapprove, or recommend changes to proposals submitted by Nasdaq. In addition, the SEC may delay the initiation of the public comment process or the approval process. This delay in approving
changes, or the altering of any proposed change, could have an adverse effect on Nasdaq's business, financial condition and operating results. Nasdaq not only must compete with ECNs that are not
subject to the SEC approval process, but Nasdaq must also compete with other exchanges that are subject to lower regulation and surveillance costs than Nasdaq. This self-regulation cost
that Nasdaq is required to undertake contributes to the high quality regulation of its market that Nasdaq desires. However, with the fragmentation of trading that has occurred through SEC
encouragement, fragmentation of regulation has followed, and there is a significant risk that the effectiveness of the regulation services that Nasdaq pays the NASD to provide will diminish due to
this fragmentation. Additionally, there is a risk that trading will shift to exchanges that spend significantly less on regulation services. Nasdaq has raised both concerns -regulatory fragmentation
and regulatory arbitrage—to the SEC in an attempt to ensure that the SEC does not permit competition to harm regulation. However, there can be no assurance that the SEC will act favorably
regarding Nasdaq's arguments.

System limitations or failures or security breaches could harm Nasdaq's business.

Nasdaq's business depends on the integrity and performance of the computer and communications systems supporting it. If Nasdaq's systems cannot be expanded to
cope with increased demand or otherwise fail to perform, Nasdaq could experience unanticipated disruptions in service, slower response times and delays in the introduction of new products and
services. These consequences could result in lower trading volumes, financial losses, decreased customer service and satisfaction, litigation


or customer claims and regulatory sanctions. Nasdaq has experienced occasional systems failures and delays in the past and it could experience future systems failures and delays.

Nasdaq
uses internally developed systems to operate its business, including transaction processing systems to accommodate increased capacity. However, if The Nasdaq Stock Market's
trading volume increases unexpectedly, Nasdaq will need to expand and upgrade its technology, transaction processing systems and network infrastructure. Nasdaq does not know whether it will be able to
project accurately the rate, timing, or cost of any increases, or expand and upgrade its systems and infrastructure to accommodate any increases in a timely manner.

Nasdaq's
systems and operations also are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, natural disasters, power loss, sabotage or terrorism, computer viruses, intentional acts
of vandalism, and similar events. Nasdaq has active and aggressive programs in place to identify and minimize its exposure to these vulnerabilities and works in collaboration with the technology
industry to share corrective measures with Nasdaq's business partners. Nasdaq currently maintains multiple computer facilities that are designed to provide redundancy and back-up to reduce
the risk of system disruptions, and has facilities in place that are expected to maintain service during a system disruption. Any system failure that causes an interruption in service or decreases the
responsiveness of Nasdaq's service could impair its reputation, damage its brand name and negatively impact its revenue. Nasdaq also relies on a number of third parties for systems support. Any
interruption in these third-party services or deterioration in the performance of these services could also be disruptive to Nasdaq's business and have a material adverse effect on its business,
financial condition and operating results.

Nasdaq may not be able to keep up with rapid technological and other competitive changes affecting the structure of the securities markets.

The markets in which Nasdaq competes are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent enhancements to existing services and
products, the introduction of new services and products and changing customer demands. These market characteristics are heightened by the emerging nature of the Internet and the trend for companies
from many industries to offer Internet-based products and services. In addition, the widespread adoption of new Internet, networking, or telecommunications technologies or other technological changes
could require Nasdaq to incur substantial expenditures to modify or adapt its services or infrastructure. Nasdaq's future success will depend on its ability to respond to changing technologies on a
timely and cost-effective basis. Nasdaq's operating results may be adversely affected if it cannot successfully develop, introduce, or market new services and products. In addition, any
failure by Nasdaq to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences, or any significant delays in other product development efforts, could have a material adverse
effect on Nasdaq's business, financial condition and operating results.

Nasdaq may have difficulty continuing prior levels of growth.

For several years, Nasdaq experienced significant growth in its business and the number of its employees. This required Nasdaq to increase its investment in
technology, management personnel, market regulatory services and facilities. Over the last three years, however, the securities industry and stock markets have faced adverse conditions. As a result,
Nasdaq has not been able, and in the future may not be able, to continue prior levels growth. In addition, Nasdaq may have difficulty managing its business as it is forced to reduce its expenses to
deal with contraction in its business. In an attempt to stimulate future growth, Nasdaq has undertaken several initiatives to increase its business, including enhancing existing products, developing
new products and forming strategic relationships. The increased costs associated with these initiatives may not be offset by corresponding increases in its revenue. No assurance can be made that
Nasdaq has made adequate allowances for the changes and risks associated with the weakened equities market, that its systems, procedures, or controls will be adequate to support


its operations, or that its management will be able to offer and expand its services successfully, particularly if adverse market conditions continue. If Nasdaq is unable to manage its operations
effectively, its business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.

Nasdaq may need additional funds to support its business plan.

Nasdaq depends on the availability of adequate capital to maintain and develop its business. Nasdaq believes that its current capital requirements will be met
from internally generated funds and from the funds raised in connection with the Restructuring. However, based upon a variety of factors, including the market share of SuperMontage, reductions in fee
levels caused by increased competition, the cost of service and technology upgrades and regulatory costs, Nasdaq's ability to fund its capital requirements may vary from those currently planned. There
can be no assurance that additional capital will be available on a timely basis, or on favorable terms or at all.

Nasdaq
had total debt outstanding of approximately $441.0 million on December 31, 2002. This debt contains certain covenant provisions that are normally associated with
debt financing. Failure to satisfy these covenants could cause the acceleration of principal and interest on all of the outstanding debt. In addition, as of the date of this report, Nasdaq had issued
and outstanding 1,338,402 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, as a result of which Nasdaq is required to make regular dividend payments to the NASD. The dividends payable are calculated based
on a dividend rate that is currently 7.6% and increases to 10.6% in all years commencing after March 2004.

Nasdaq may not be successful in executing its international strategy.

Nasdaq has had only very limited experience in developing localized versions of its services and in marketing and operating its services internationally. To date,
Nasdaq's international efforts have not yet
achieved profitability and Nasdaq Japan ceased operations in 2002, resulting in Nasdaq taking an other than temporary impairment of its entire investment in Nasdaq Japan. See "Consolidated Financial
Statements, Note 2."

There
can be no assurance that Nasdaq will be able to succeed in deploying its market model and brand in other international markets. Nasdaq may experience difficulty in managing its
international operations because of, among other things, competitive conditions overseas, difficulties in supervising foreign operations, established domestic markets, language and cultural
differences, political and economic instability, sustained weakness in European equities markets, and changes in regulatory requirements or the failure to obtain requested regulatory changes and
approvals. Any of the above could have an adverse effect on the success of Nasdaq's international operations and, consequently, on Nasdaq's business, financial condition and operating results. See
"Item 1. Business—Other Products and Markets—Nasdaq Europe S.A./N.V." and "—Nasdaq Japan."

Certain Congressional and SEC reviews could result in a reduction in data fees that could reduce Nasdaq's revenue.

The SEC is reviewing concerns by industry members that the present levels of data fees do not properly reflect the costs associated with their collection,
processing and distribution. The SEC currently is reviewing a report on the issues from its Advisory Committee on Market Information that was issued in September 2001 and comments on the
report. Nasdaq has argued that there is significant value in the quality of data it provides to the investing community. Nasdaq also has argued that there are regulatory, market capacity, and other
related costs of operating the market. A fee realignment that does not recognize the full value of the data and/or the market costs of creating and delivering high quality market data could reduce
overall data revenue in the future and adversely affect Nasdaq's business, financial condition and operating results.


Congress
conducted hearings in 2000 and 2001 and introduced legislation in 2000 pertaining to whether stock exchanges and markets have a property right to quote and trade data. Since
securities firms are required to supply the market operator with quote and trade information, some have argued that the operator has no right to be able to validate the data, consolidate the data with
other market participant data and sell the data back to the securities firms. This issue may continue to be debated and the outcome could have a significant impact on the viability of Nasdaq's data
revenue and, as a consequence, on its business, financial condition and operating results.

Failure to protect its intellectual property rights could harm Nasdaq's brand-building efforts and ability to compete effectively.

To protect its rights to its intellectual property, Nasdaq relies on a combination of trademark laws, copyright laws, patent laws, trade secret protection,
confidentiality agreements, and other contractual arrangements with its affiliates, clients, strategic partners, and others. The protective steps Nasdaq has taken may be inadequate to deter
misappropriation of its proprietary information. Nasdaq may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, its intellectual property rights. Nasdaq has registered,
or applied to register, its trademarks in the U.S. and in 40 foreign jurisdictions and has pending U.S. and foreign applications for other trademarks. Effective trademark, copyright, patent and trade
secret protection may not be available in every country in which Nasdaq offers or intends to offer its services. Failure to protect its intellectual property adequately could harm its brand and affect
its ability to compete effectively. Further, defending its intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, which could adversely affect
Nasdaq's business, financial condition and operating results.

Failure to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect Nasdaq's ability to conduct its business.

Nasdaq's future success depends on the continued service and performance of its senior management and certain other key personnel. For example, Nasdaq is
dependent on specialized systems personnel to operate, maintain and upgrade its systems. The inability of Nasdaq to retain key personnel or retain other qualified personnel could adversely affect
Nasdaq's business, financial condition and operating results.

Nasdaq is subject to risks relating to litigation and potential securities laws liability.

Many
aspects of Nasdaq's business potentially involve substantial risks of liability. While Nasdaq enjoys immunity for self-regulatory organization activities, it could be
exposed to liability under federal and state securities laws, other federal and state laws and court decisions, as well as rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and other federal and state
agencies. These risks include, among others, potential liability from disputes over the terms of a trade, or claims that a system failure or delay cost a customer money, that Nasdaq entered into an
unauthorized transaction or that it provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a securities transaction. As Nasdaq intends to defend any such litigation actively,
significant legal expenses could be incurred. An adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against Nasdaq could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and operating
results.

Lack of operating history as for-profit entity and potential conflicts of interest with related parties.

While
Nasdaq has an established operating history, it has only operated as a for-profit company with private ownership interests since June 28, 2000. Therefore, Nasdaq
is subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with any newly independent company. Until Exchange Registration, the NASD will retain voting control over Nasdaq. See "Item 1.
Business—Nasdaq's History and Structure." In addition, four of the 20 members of the Nasdaq Board are currently members of the NASD Board. Until Exchange Registration, the NASD will be in
a position to continue to control substantially all


matters affecting Nasdaq, including any determination with respect to the direction and policies of Nasdaq, acquisition or disposition of assets, future issuances of securities of Nasdaq, Nasdaq's
incurrence of debt and any dividend payable on the Common Stock.

Conflicts
of interest may arise between Nasdaq and the NASD, or its affiliates, in a number of areas relating to their past and ongoing relationships, including the nature, quality, and
pricing of services rendered; shared marketing functions; tax and employee benefit matters; indemnity agreements; sales or distributions by the NASD of all or any portion of its ownership interest in
Nasdaq; or the NASD's ability to influence certain affairs of Nasdaq prior to Exchange Registration. There can be no assurance that the NASD and Nasdaq will be able to resolve any potential conflict
or that, if resolved, Nasdaq would not receive more favorable resolution if it were dealing with an unaffiliated party.

Conflicts
may also arise between Nasdaq and Amex by virtue of commitments made by the NASD in connection with the NASD's acquisition of Amex.

The intercompany agreements may not be effected on terms as favorable to Nasdaq as could have been obtained from unaffiliated third
parties.

For
purposes of governing their ongoing relationship, Nasdaq and the NASD, or their affiliates, have entered into various agreements involving the provision of services such as market
surveillance and other regulatory functions, finance, technology infrastructure, legal and facilities sharing. Nasdaq has negotiated an agreement with the NASDR pursuant to which NASDR will regulate
Nasdaq trading activity commencing upon the effectiveness of Exchange Registration. At the time the parties negotiated this agreement, the parties envisioned that the NASDR would continue regulating
trading activity on Nasdaq under a long-term contract that establishes the various functions NASDR will perform and the price that Nasdaq will pay for these functions. The functions
covered under this agreement, as negotiated, are substantially of the same type and scope as those NASDR performs under the Delegation Plan.

In
the future Nasdaq may determine that it is necessary to negotiate new contracts with the NASD or its affiliates, or to renegotiate existing contracts between the parties. Although it
is the intention of the
parties to negotiate agreements that provide for arm's length, fair market value pricing, there can be no assurance that these contemplated agreements, or the transactions provided in them, will be
effected on terms as favorable to Nasdaq as could have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties. The cost to Nasdaq for such services could increase at a faster rate than its revenue and could
adversely affect Nasdaq's business, financial condition and operating results. See "Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions."

The SEC may challenge or not approve Nasdaq's plan to become a national securities exchange or it may require changes in the manner Nasdaq conducts its
business before granting this approval.

The
SEC may not approve Nasdaq's application for Exchange Registration or may require changes in Nasdaq's corporate governance structure and the way Nasdaq conducts its business before
granting this approval. Failure to be so registered could adversely effect Nasdaq's competitive position and could have a material adverse effect on Nasdaq's business conditions and business
prospects.

In
connection with Exchange Registration, certain changes must be made to the national market system plans. Certain participants in the plans may object to, or request modifications to,
amendments proposed by Nasdaq. Failure to resolve these issues in a timely manner could delay Exchange Registration.

There
can be no assurance that Exchange Registration will occur or that the registration process will occur in a timely manner. Because of the nature of the regulatory process and the
variety of


market structure issues that would have to be resolved across all markets, the registration process could be lengthy. In the long-term, the failure to be approved as an exchange by the
SEC may have negative implications on the ability of Nasdaq to fund its planned initiatives.

In
addition, the SEC has not yet agreed and may not agree to Nasdaq's proposal to continue to operate the OTC Bulletin Board after Exchange Registration.

There currently is a limited trading market for the Common Stock.

The Common Stock is traded in the over-the-counter market through the OTC Bulletin Board. The trading volume in the Common Stock has been
relatively limited, with average daily trading volume from the start of trading on July 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002 of approximately 14,000 shares. A more active trading market for
the Common Stock may not develop and such market as does develop on the OTC Bulletin Board may have limited liquidity and considerable volatility.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of Nasdaq should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements
and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Nasdaq's actual results may differ
materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth under "Item 1. Business—Risk Factors"
and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Overview

Nasdaq operates The Nasdaq Stock Market, the world's largest electronic screen-based equity securities market and the world's largest equity securities market
based on share volume. Nasdaq operates in one segment as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 131, "Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information". Nasdaq's principal business products are price discovery and trading services, the sale of related data and information, and listing securities of issuers. The majority of this business
is transacted with companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market, market data vendors, and firms in the broker-dealer industry within the U.S.

Nasdaq
provides products and services in the following three principal categories:

•

Transaction
services include collecting, processing, and disseminating price quotes of Nasdaq-listed securities, the routing and execution of buy and sell
orders for Nasdaq-listed securities, and transaction reporting services;

•

Market
information services provide varying levels of quote and trade information to data vendors, who in turn sell the information to the public; and

•

Corporate
Client Group provides customer services and information products to Nasdaq-listed companies and is responsible for obtaining new listings on The
Nasdaq Stock Market.

On
March 8, 2002, Nasdaq completed the Repurchase by purchasing 33,768,895 shares of Nasdaq's Common Stock owned by the NASD, which represented all of the remaining outstanding
shares of Common Stock owned by the NASD, except for the 43,225,976 shares of Common Stock underlying the warrants issued by the NASD as part of the Restructuring. Nasdaq purchased the Common Stock
for approximately $305.2 million in aggregate cash consideration, 1,338,402 shares of Nasdaq's Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock (face and liquidation value of $100 per share, plus any
accumulated unpaid dividends), and one share of Nasdaq's Series B Preferred Stock (face and liquidation value of $1.00 per share). The Repurchase furthered Nasdaq's goal of separating itself
from the NASD. As a result of the Repurchase, the NASD owns approximately 55.2% of the outstanding Common Stock on a non-diluted basis and 0.0% of the Common Stock on a diluted basis
(assuming the full exercise of all warrants purchased in Phase I and II of the Restructuring). In addition, the NASD owns all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the one
share of Series B Preferred Stock. The Series B Preferred Stock is structured to ensure that the NASD will retain voting control over Nasdaq until Exchange Registration is achieved.

Business Environment

Economic conditions in the U.S. improved only slightly during 2002 as growth remained sluggish in the face of growing unemployment and further eroding consumer
confidence. The failure of the economy to fully bounce back from the economic downturn in 2001, as well as a number of high-profile corporate scandals increased investor uncertainty
throughout 2002. This uncertainty had a negative effect on the performance of the U.S. equity markets, as evidenced by declines in all the major U.S. stock indices. During 2002, the Nasdaq Composite
Index fell approximately 32%, the S&P 500 fell


approximately 23%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell approximately 17% and the Wilshire 5000 fell approximately 22%.

Market
declines adversely affected both investors and the securities industry, and interest in equities remained much lower than the levels reached in 1999 and 2000. Decreased market
activity continued to reduce demand for a variety of Nasdaq market services related to trading, system access and market information. Online trading, which declined significantly in 2001, has yet to
rebound in a way that would reverse the contraction and staff reductions widely occurring in the securities industry. Average daily share volume in 2002 was approximately the same as in 2001. Although
average daily reported share volume was down almost 8% in 2002 compared to 2001, some of this decline in reported share volume can be accounted for by a technical change in trade reporting by
institutional broker-dealers that occurred during 2002. The change involved some market participants charging clients an explicit commission (as opposed to the traditional net price) and this change
results in lower reported share volume. However, underlying trading activity is unaffected by this situation; therefore the change to agency trade reporting does not have a correspondingly large
impact on Nasdaq's revenue. Average daily dollar volume declined more than 34% during 2002 due to the substantial drop in average stock prices compounded by the smaller reduction in share volume.

Weak
economic conditions and lower stock prices also limited the ability of companies to raise money in the equity markets. New issues on all U.S. markets were well off the pace set in
previous years, although roughly in line with 2001, which was also a weak year for new listings. Particularly affected were companies in the technology and growth fields, a high percentage of which
historically have listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. In 2002, there were only 51 IPOs on The Nasdaq Stock Market compared to 63 in 2001 and 397 in 2000. This reduction in IPOs limited Nasdaq's
opportunities to expand listing revenue and had a spillover effect on transaction and market information services revenue. The market declines also produced a large number of delistings; 571 companies
delisted from The Nasdaq Stock Market for a variety of reasons in 2002. This was an improvement from the 770 delistings in 2001. Approximately 82% of the delistings in 2002 were related to the failure
to meet The Nasdaq Stock Market's listing standards or merger and acquisition activity, 8% delisted as a result of switches to a competing market and the remaining 10% ceased being listed for other
reasons.

Overview of First Half of 2002.

Trading activity was generally stable throughout the first six months
of 2002, but considerably lower than in the comparable period of 2001. Average daily share volume in the first quarter of 2002 averaged 1.82 billion shares compared to 2.14 billion
shares in the first quarter of 2001, a drop of approximately 15%. Average daily share volume in the second quarter of 2002 averaged 1.83 billion shares compared to 1.95 billion in the
second quarter of 2001, a loss of roughly 6%. The number of trades also declined by 17% and 5% in the first and second quarters of 2002 as compared to the first and second quarter of 2001. Decreases
in share and trade volume led to decreases in transaction services revenue. Market information services revenue was adversely impacted by this drop in daily trading activity and by the overall market
decline, as demand for professional and non-professional market information services declined. The slowing economy also led to an increase in delistings and decreases in the number of both
IPOs and listed companies issuing additional shares. However, reported revenue associated with Corporate Client Group activities increased during the first half of 2002 mainly due to the introduction
in January 2002 of a revised fee structure for annual renewal fees. Total new issues of companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market, including IPOs, were 60 in the first half of 2002 compared
to 69 during the same period of 2001.

Overview of Third Quarter of 2002.

Although average daily share and trading volumes historically have
been weakest in the third quarter, in 2002, third quarter volume rose almost 6% to 1.72 billion shares per day in the third quarter of 2002 from 1.63 billion shares per day during the
same period in 2001. This increase was driven in part by a dramatic increase in trade volume in one security listed on The Nasdaq National Market that was subsequently delisted in the third quarter of
2002. Revenue from Transaction Services and the Corporate Client Group, as well as total revenue, were up slightly in the


third quarter of 2002 compared to levels in the third quarter of 2001. New listings remained well below historic levels during the third quarter of 2002. There were only 23 new listings of companies
on The Nasdaq Stock Market during the quarter, down from 32 in the same period of 2001. This included six IPOs, five less than in the comparable period in 2001.

Overview of Fourth Quarter of 2002.

Trading activity was lightest during the fourth quarter of 2002
due to concerns about the economic recovery and the geo-political environment. Average daily share volume in this period fell approximately 12% to 1.64 billion shares compared to
1.86 billion shares in the fourth quarter of 2001, a period that included a substantial increase in trading activity in the wake of September 11, 2001. This impacted most of Nasdaq's
major business lines, as total revenues decreased
in the fourth quarter of 2002 compared to the same period in 2001. Corporate Client Group did post an increase in revenue in the fourth quarter compared to the same period in 2001 primarily due to the
introduction in January 2002 of a revised fee structure for annual renewal fees. There were 38 new listings including 16 new IPOs in the fourth quarter of 2002. While the new listing figures
are down slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2001, the figures reflect a solid increase over new listings in the third quarter of 2002.

2003 Outlook.

Nasdaq continues to face economic and competitive challenges. In January and
February 2003, trading volume was down slightly from the fourth quarter of 2002. Daily share volume in January and February averaged 1.55 billion and 1.31 billion shares,
respectively. Trading activity also has been affected by concern among investors about the markets and the economy as a whole and it is possible that volume will remain flat until traders and the
investing public are more certain about the economic condition of the U.S. and the outcome of the war in Iraq. There is also a threat of some competitive attrition of Nasdaq's principal business lines
as some ECNs, which have traditionally relied on Nasdaq's execution and reporting systems, have aligned themselves with regional exchanges, or with the ADF, or are seeking to establish themselves as
national securities exchanges. All these moves will increase competition with Nasdaq for trade reporting, Tape Fees, and possibly even listings business. Any decision by other market participants to
quote through regional exchanges or the ADF could have a negative impact on Nasdaq's share of quotes and trades in securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market.

Nasdaq
successfully completed the roll out of its new order routing and execution system, SuperMontage, on December 2, 2002. SuperMontage is intended to attract more orders and
quotes to The Nasdaq Stock Market by providing a comprehensive display of interest at the inside market and four other price levels away, thus increasing competition and market transparency. While the
data on SuperMontage is still preliminary, initial results from January and February 2003 indicate that SuperMontage is helping to stabilize the share of transactions executed over Nasdaq
systems which had been declining. Nasdaq is currently reviewing changes to the SuperMontage system to increase usage of the new system by market participants. For example, in early
February 2003, Nasdaq began allowing order entry firms to enter certain limit orders into SuperMontage. Nasdaq's goal is to build market share growth in 2003 by encouraging user acceptance of
SuperMontage, and Nasdaq will continue to use competitive pricing to bring more order flow to SuperMontage.

Nasdaq
is in the process of implementing changes to its listing standards and process for delisting due, in part, to the substantial decline in stock prices of many companies listed on
The Nasdaq Stock Market that continue to meet many of Nasdaq's listing standards, but no longer satisfy the minimum bid price requirements. These changes are discussed in "Item 1.
Business

—

Products and Services—Corporate Client Group." Nasdaq anticipates that these new rules will result in more listed
companies transferring from one tier of The Nasdaq Stock Market to the other than has occurred in previous years.

It
is difficult at this time to determine when the economy and market conditions will begin a sustained improvement. A rise in investor confidence could result in a corresponding
increase in


demand for transaction services and data products. Trading activity could see an additional boost as investors returning to the market benefit from SuperMontage, which provides a faster more
efficient system offering more liquidity and order protection than ever before on The Nasdaq Stock Market. Any sustained rebound in the equity markets may provide Nasdaq with greater opportunities for
new listings and secondary offerings. However, if weak domestic and international economic conditions continue or worsen in the face of global conflicts and instability, Nasdaq's business, financial
condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely impacted.

Change in Accounting Principle

On August 17, 2001, Nasdaq concluded discussions with the SEC with respect to the implementation in its financial statements of Staff Accounting Bulletin
101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" ("SAB 101"), which became effective for SEC reporting companies in the fourth quarter of 2000. Nasdaq became a SEC public reporting company on
June 29, 2001, the effective date of its Registration Statement on Form 10. As a result of the discussions with the SEC, Nasdaq changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition
for certain components of its Corporate Client Group revenue (the "Change in Accounting Principle").

In
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, as SAB 101 was adopted effective the fourth quarter of 2000, the change in accounting principle has been
applied as of January 1, 2000. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance prior to SAB 101, Nasdaq recognized revenue for issuer initial listing fees and LAS fees in the month the
listing occurred or in the period additional shares were issued, respectively. Nasdaq now recognizes revenue related to initial listing fees and LAS fees on a straight-line basis over
estimated service periods, which are six and four years, respectively.

As
a result of the adoption of SAB 101, Nasdaq recognized a one-time cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2000. This cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle decreased net income for the year ended December 31, 2000 by $101.1 million ($0.90 per share), resulting in net income of $23.3 million
($0.21 per share). The adjustment to December 31, 2000 net income for the cumulative change to prior years' results consists of the following:

As
a result of the change in accounting principle, for the year ended December 31, 2000, revenue decreased $35.5 million and pro forma net income, excluding the cumulative
change in accounting principle, decreased $20.8 million ($0.19 per share).

For
the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, Nasdaq recognized $31.6 million, $44.9 million, and $55.7 million in revenue, respectively, that was
included in the cumulative effect adjustment as of January 1, 2000. This revenue contributed $19.2 million (after income taxes of $12.4 million), $27.3 million (after
income taxes of $17.6 million), and $33.3 million (after income taxes of $22.4 million), to net income for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Revenue
which is deferred in accordance with SAB 101 as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 is discussed further in the "Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4".

For the Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001.

Transaction Services revenue was
$380.7 million in 2002 compared with $412.1 million in 2001, a decrease of $31.4 million or 7.6%.

Access
Services revenue was $140.8 million in 2002 compared with $165.5 million in 2001, a decrease of $24.7 million or 14.9%. This decrease was primarily due to
cost saving initiatives among Nasdaq's
market participants and the consolidation of major trading firms, which resulted in fewer subscriber log-ons to Nasdaq systems. Access Services revenue is derived from Nasdaq Workstation
II and Application Programming Interface, CTCI, Nasdaq Tools and the Nasdaq Workstation Weblink system (Weblink).

The
Nasdaq Workstation II, along with Application Programming Interface, is the trader's direct connection to Nasdaq's quote and trade execution facilities, providing access to quotation
services, automated trade executions, real-time reporting, trade negotiations and clearing. These access devices provided revenue of $118.4 million in 2002 compared with
$142.9 million in 2001, a decrease of $24.5 million or 17.1%. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the number of trader log-ons, reflecting the downturn in the
market environment and market participant's consolidations. Nasdaq Workstation II fees are charged monthly based upon the number of authorized log-on identifications.

Nasdaq
provides CTCI for users to report trades, enter orders into SuperMontage and receive execution messages. CTCI links market participants' automated systems to Nasdaq. This
interface has recently been upgraded to a new protocol and delivers increased line speeds. CTCI provided revenues of $17.1 million in 2002 compared with $15.5 million in 2001, an
increase of $1.6 million or 10.3%. New fees associated with the upgraded interface and an increase in customers were primarily responsible for the increase in revenue. Users are charged a
monthly fee based upon the bandwidth of the line.

Also
included in Access Services revenue is Nasdaq Tools and Weblink, which totaled $3.8 million and $1.5 million, respectively for 2002 and $6.6 million and
$0.5 million, respectively for 2001. Prior to April 1, 2002, Weblink revenue was disclosed as Other Transaction Services revenue and prior to July 31, 2002, revenue from Nasdaq
Tools was disclosed as Other revenue. Prior periods amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation of revenue for Access Services, Other Transaction Services revenue and
Other revenue.

Execution
Services revenue totaled $157.5 million in 2002 compared with $154.4 million in 2001, an increase of $3.1 million or 2.0% primarily due to revised pricing
for SuperSoes, including the introduction of a new, incremental fee associated with quote updates in Nasdaq quotation systems offset by lower overall share volume and market share in 2002 compared to
2001. Execution Services revenue is primarily derived from SuperMontage, SuperSoes, SelectNet, SOES, Quote Update, ACES and CAES.

In
the fourth quarter of 2002, Nasdaq fully implemented SuperMontage, a new trading system designed to refine how market participants can access, process, display, and integrate orders
and quotes in The Nasdaq Stock Market. SuperMontage is intended to attract more orders to The Nasdaq Stock Market, thereby increasing competition and market transparency. SuperMontage replaced
SuperSoes as the transaction system for automatic execution of buy and sell orders as well as SelectNet, which functioned as an automated Nasdaq service to facilitate order executions by linking all
market participants that trade Nasdaq-listed securities. (See discussion of SuperSoes and SelectNet below.) SuperMontage revenue was $11.0 million in 2002.

As
discussed above, SuperSoes was Nasdaq's primary execution system prior to the implementation of SuperMontage. SuperSoes was fully implemented on July 30, 2001. SuperSoes
combined features of the existing SelectNet and SOES execution systems and was only available for securities listed on The Nasdaq National Market tier of The Nasdaq Stock Market. SuperSoes replaced
SelectNet mandatory execution requirements and SOES. (See discussion of SelectNet and SOES below.) SuperSoes had


resulted in the migration of significant transaction volume, and its corresponding revenue, from SelectNet and SOES to SuperSoes. On February 1, 2002 Nasdaq introduced a fee charged to market
participants for updating quotes on The Nasdaq Stock Market. This quote update fee, which contributed $18.4 million in revenue in 2002, was eliminated on February 1, 2003. SuperSoes
revenue and quote update fees were $109.7 million in 2002 compared with $32.3 million in 2001, an increase of $77.4 million mainly due to SuperSoes being utilized as the primary
execution system for nine months in 2002 compared with five months in 2001. Nasdaq retired the SuperSoes system in December 2002.

The
SelectNet execution system provided revenue of $28.7 million in 2002 compared with $87.1 million in 2001, a decrease of $58.4 million or 67.0%. As discussed
above, SelectNet functioned as an automated Nasdaq service to facilitate order execution by linking all market participants that traded Nasdaq-listed securities. Prior to the implementation of
SuperSoes on July 30, 2001, SelectNet was the primary system that market makers used to trade with one another. During 2002, SelectNet served primarily as a means for participants to reach ECN
quotes on The Nasdaq Stock Market and was also a tool for market participants seeking to negotiate trades with particular counter-parties to broadcast such an order to all market makers. The decrease
in revenue for SelectNet was primarily due to a decrease in trade volume related to the introduction of SuperSoes and ECNs increased buildout of direct links to customers. SelectNet fees were charged
on a per transaction basis. Nasdaq retired the SelectNet system in December 2002.

During
2001, SOES provided revenue of $26.1 million. Due to the migration to SuperSoes, revenue from SOES decreased and accounted for less than 1% of revenue in 2002. Nasdaq
retired the SOES system in December 2002.

Also
included in Execution Services revenue is revenue from ACES, CAES and Primex. ACES and CAES revenues totaled $7.7 million in 2002 compared with $8.9 million in 2001, a
decrease of $1.2 million or 13.5% primarily due to a price decrease for the ACES product that was in affect for 12 months in 2002 compared with four months in 2001. Primex revenue
totaled $0.4 million in 2002. Nasdaq began charging fees for Primex on August 1, 2002. ACES is an order routing tool which routes orders directly between market participants. CAES is an
automatic and order delivery execution system for NYSE and Amex-listed securities. Prior to April 1, 2002, ACES and CAES revenue was disclosed as Other Transaction Services revenue.
As such, prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation of ACES and CAES revenues.

Trade
Reporting revenue totaled $78.6 million in 2002 compared with $87.3 million in 2001, a decrease of $8.7 million or 10.0%. This decrease was primarily due to a
decline in overall share and trade volume and the reporting of trades to regional exchanges and the ADF. Revenue from Trade Reporting which
is derived from ACT, an automated service that provides the post-execution steps of price reporting, volume comparison, clearing of pre-negotiated trades, and risk management
services. ACT fees are primarily charged on a per transaction basis.

For the Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.

Transaction Service revenue was
$412.1 million in 2001 compared with $398.5 million in 2000, an increase of $13.6 million or 3.4%.

Access
Services revenue was $165.5 million in 2001 compared with $128.2 million in 2000, an increase of $37.3 million or 29.1% primarily due to increased revenue
from the Nasdaq Workstation II and CTCI.

The
Nasdaq Workstation II, along with Application Programming Interfaces, provided revenue of $142.9 million in 2001 compared with $118.2 million in 2000, an increase of
$24.7 million or 20.9% primarily due to higher fees used to expand network capacity.

CTCI
provided revenue of $15.5 million in 2001 compared with $3.2 million in 2000, an increase of $12.3 million due to an increase in fees associated with an
upgraded interface and the direct billing by


Nasdaq for CTCI services. Prior to December 2000, the majority of fees for CTCI services were charged by WorldCom, the system provider, rather than by Nasdaq.

Also
included in Access Services revenue is Nasdaq Tools and Nasdaq Workstation Weblink. Nasdaq Tools revenue totaled $6.6 million in 2001 compared with $6.8 million in
2000, a decrease of $0.2 million or 2.9%. Weblink was introduced in 2001 and provided revenue of $0.5 million in 2001. Prior to April 1, 2002, Weblink revenue was disclosed as
Other Transaction Services revenue and prior to July 31, 2002, revenue from Nasdaq Tools was disclosed as Other revenue. Prior periods amounts have been reclassed to conform to the current
period presentation of revenue for Access Services, Other Transaction Services revenue and Other revenue.

Execution
Services revenue totaled $154.4 million in 2001 compared with $164.4 million in 2000, a decrease of $10.0 million or 6.1%. The decrease was primarily due
to a decline in market share for ACES related revenue, a price decrease for the ACES product and a decline in demand for securities listed on The Nasdaq SmallCap Market. In addition, there was a
decrease in SelectNet and SOES revenue, however, this decrease was effectively offset by an increase in SuperSoes revenue. SuperSoes which was the primary execution system in 2001 for transactions on
The Nasdaq National market was fully implemented on July 30, 2001 and combined features of the SelectNet and SOES execution systems. SuperSoes provided revenue of $32.3 million in 2001.

SelectNet
revenue was $87.1 million in 2001 compared with $113.5 million in 2000, a decrease of $26.4 million or 23.3%. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease
in trade volume related to the introduction of SuperSoes on July 30, 2001, which reduced the number of trades directed to SelectNet. Revenues from SelectNet also decreased as a result of the
introduction of a new fee schedule for SelectNet in the third quarter of 2001. While Nasdaq revised the SelectNet fee schedule on October 1, 2001 to mitigate the negative effect of the prior
fee schedule, the migration of trading to SuperSoes caused revenue from SelectNet to continue to decline in the fourth quarter. With the implementation of SuperSoes, SelectNet was primarily a tool
used by market makers to negotiate trades.

SOES,
a system providing for the automatic execution of small orders, provided revenue of $26.1 million in 2001 compared with $32.2 million in 2000, a decrease of
$6.1 million or 18.9% primarily due to the migration of SOES trading activity into the new SuperSoes system for securities listed on The Nasdaq National Market.

Also
included in Execution Services revenue is revenue from ACES and CAES, which totaled $8.9 million in 2001 compared with $18.7 million in 2000, a decrease of
$9.8 million or 52.4% primarily due to a decline in market share for ACES related revenue, a price decrease for the ACES product and a decline in demand for securities listed on The Nasdaq
SmallCap Market.

Trade
Reporting revenue totaled $87.3 million in 2001 compared with $100.0 million in 2000, a decrease of $12.7 million or 12.7%. The decrease was primarily due to
various fee changes enacted subsequent to March 31, 2000. These changes included a cap in risk management fees, fee reductions on certain existing services, and a rule change that eliminated
charges for certain transactions.

Market Information Services revenue was
$202.4 million in 2002 compared to $243.9 million in 2001, a decrease of $41.5 million or 17.0%.

Nasdaq's
Level 1 service provides last trade and current inside quote information for securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. Level 1 revenue totaled $142.3 million in 2002
compared with $161.8 million in 2001, a decrease of $19.5 million or 12.1%. The decrease was due to cost saving initiatives among Nasdaq's market participants and the consolidation of
major trading firms causing a decrease in professional Level 1 subscriptions. Fees for professional users are based on monthly subscriptions to terminals or access lines. Also contributing to the
decline was a decrease in non-professional subscriptions. Providers of Level 1 data to non-professional users have the option to offer this information through either a flat
monthly rate or a per query charge. Prior to April 1, 2002, certain Level 1 subscriptions that were included in the bundled NQDS data product were disclosed as
NQDS revenues. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation of revenue for Level 1 and NQDS.

NQDS
provides subscribers with the best quote from each Nasdaq market participant. NQDS revenues totaled $37.5 million in 2002 compared with $43.4 million in 2001, a
decrease of $5.9 million or 13.6% primarily due to cost saving initiatives among Nasdaq's market participants and the consolidation of major trading firms causing a decrease in professional
NQDS subscriptions, partially offset by growth in non-professional subscriptions in the fourth quarter of 2002. NQDS revenue is derived from monthly subscriptions. Prior to April 1, 2002,
certain Level 1 subscriptions that were included in the bundled NQDS data product were disclosed as NQDS revenue. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period
presentation of revenue for Level 1 and NQDS.

Nasdaq
InterMarket Tape Fee revenues are derived from data revenue generated by the Consolidated Quotation Plan and the Consolidated Tape Association Plan (collectively, "CQ/CTA Plans").
The information collected under the CQ/CTA Plans is sold to data vendors, who in turn sell it to the public. Nasdaq's InterMarket tape revenue is directly related to both its percentage of trades in
exchange listed securities that are reported through the CQ/CTA Plans and the size of the revenue sharing pool. Part of Nasdaq's CQ/CTA revenue sharing pool is shared with certain market participants
that meet minimum revenue threshold requirements. The minimum threshold requirement was eliminated as of July 1, 2002. Nasdaq InterMarket Tape Fee revenues totaled $38.6 million in 2002
compared with $32.5 million in 2001, an increase of $6.1 million or 18.8%. The increase is primarily due to a revision of estimated payouts for revenue sharing. This increase was
partially offset by cost saving initiatives among market participants and the consolidation of major trading firms causing a decrease in the size of CQ/CTA Tape Fee sharing pool. Nasdaq InterMarket
Tape Fee revenue was also negatively impacted as a result of Island reporting the Nasdaq-100 exchange traded fund (the "QQQ") to the Cincinnati Stock Exchange beginning in the fourth
quarter of 2002. However, partially offsetting


this revenue reduction, Nasdaq receives licensing fees that are reported in Other revenue from regional exchanges that report QQQ trades.

Nasdaq
shared Tape Fees, i.e., revenue from the sale of tape data, for Nasdaq-listed securities in two manners. First, through the UTP Plan, Nasdaq shares revenue with regional exchanges
that are members of the UTP Plan and that trade Nasdaq-listed securities. UTP Plan participants are paid based on the total shares and trades that they execute as a percentage of all shares and trades
executed in securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. Nasdaq Tape Fee revenue sharing with UTP Plan participants totaled $18.3 million in 2002 compared with $4.7 million in 2001, an
increase of $13.6 million primarily due to the trade reporting activity from the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, which became an active UTP Plan participant at the end of the first quarter of 2002.

Nasdaq
also shared Tape Fee revenue with its market participants in a pilot program based on their share of trades and volume reported to Nasdaq. This revenue sharing plan was introduced
in the first quarter of 2002. During 2002, Nasdaq shared $9.0 million in Tape Fee revenue with its market participants. The data revenue sharing program was part of a larger strategy to compete
with UTP exchanges and provide proper incentive for Nasdaq members to continue to fully utilize Nasdaq's
Transaction Services. Effective June 1, 2002, the SEC abrogated certain market participant Tape Fee sharing pilot programs, which resulted in an elimination of the Nasdaq member revenue sharing
program for data covered under the UTP Plan. (See "Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2" for further discussion.)

Other
Market Information Services revenue is primarily derived from Mutual Fund Quotation Service (MFQS) revenues. MFQS provides unit investment trusts, mutual funds and money markets
funds with listing services and assists in the collection and dissemination of daily price and related data. Other Market Information Services revenue was $11.3 million in 2002 compared to
$10.9 million in 2001, an increase of $0.4 million or 3.7%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in mutual fund listings in 2002 as compared to 2001 and the introduction of a
revised fee structure in November 2002.

For the Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.

Market Information Services revenue was
$243.9 million in 2001 compared with $261.7 million in 2000, a decrease of $17.8 million or 6.8%.

Level
1 provided revenue of $161.8 million in 2001 compared with $190.5 million in 2000, a decrease of $28.7 million or 15.1%. The growth in on-line
investing through December 31, 2000 increased the usage of these fee structures by on-line brokerage firms and other Internet services. However, the weaker economic and market
conditions in 2001 caused a substantial reduction in Level 1 revenue due to a decrease in demand for both professional and non-professional per query service.

NQDS
revenues totaled $43.4 million in 2001 compared with $47.3 million in 2000, a decrease of $3.9 million or 8.2% primarily due to the introduction of the new
reduced non-professional service fee. Although the number of NQDS subscribers increased in total, revenue decreased due to the number of subscribers eligible for the new reduced
non-professional fee.

Nasdaq
InterMarket tape revenues totaled $32.5 million in 2001 compared with $21.9 million in 2000, an increase of $10.6 million or 48.4% primarily due to increased
trading through Nasdaq in Amex-listed exchange traded funds, specifically the QQQ.

Nasdaq
revenue sharing with UTP Plan participants totaled $4.7 million in 2001 compared with $4.2 million in 2000, an increase of $0.5 million or 11.9% primarily due
to the expiration of maximum revenue sharing provisions in the fourth quarter of 2001.

Other
Market Information Services revenue was $10.9 million in 2001 compared to $6.2 million in 2000, an increase of $4.7 million or 75.8%. The increase was
primarily due to the introduction of unit investment trusts services (discussed in more detail above) in February 2001. A unit investment trust is an investment company that buys and holds a
fixed portfolio of shares and holds those shares until the trust's termination date.

For the Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001.

Corporate Client Group revenue was
$176.7 million in 2002 compared to $156.1 million in 2001, an increase of $20.6 million or 13.2%.

Corporate
Client Group revenues are primarily derived from fees for annual renewal, LAS, and initial listings for companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. Fees are generally
calculated based upon total shares outstanding for the issuing company. These fees are initially deferred and amortized over the estimated periods for which the services are provided. Revenues from
initial listings fees and LAS fees are amortized over six and four years, respectively, and annual fees are amortized on a pro-rata basis over the calendar year. The difference between the
as reported revenue and the billed basis revenue is due to the amortization of fees in accordance with SAB 101 (See "Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4" for further discussion).

Annual
renewal fee totaled $102.8 million in 2002 compared with $83.1 million in 2001, an increase of $19.7 million or 23.7%. This increase was primarily due to the
introduction in January 2002 of a revised fee structure for annual renewal fees. LAS revenue totaled $37.5 million in 2002 compared with $35.9 million in 2001, an increase of
$1.6 million or 4.5%. On a billed basis, LAS fees totaled $27.9 million in 2002 compared with $41.6 million in 2001, a decrease of $13.7 million or 32.9%. The decrease was
primarily due to the number of secondary offerings decreasing from 168 in 2001 to 139 in 2002. Initial listing revenues totaled $33.6 million in 2002 compared with $35.7 million in 2001,
a decrease of $2.1 million or 5.9%. On a billed basis, initial listing fees totaled $22.8 million in 2002 compared with $12.6 million in 2001, an increase of $10.2 million
or 81.0%. The increase is primarily due to an increase in initial listing fees implemented in January 2002 which more than offset the decrease in the number of IPOs listing on The Nasdaq Stock
Market. There were 121 new listings including 51 new IPOs in 2002 compared to 145 new listings including 63 new IPOs in 2001.

For the Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.

Corporate Client Group revenue was
$156.1 million in 2001 compared to $149.3 million in 2000, an increase of $6.8 million or 4.6%.

Annual
renewal fee totaled $83.1 million in 2001 compared with $81.1 million in 2000, an increase of $2.0 million or 2.5%. LAS revenue totaled $35.9 million
in 2001 compared with $33.6 million in 2000, an increase of $2.3 million or 6.8%. On a billed basis, LAS fees totaled $41.6 million in 2001 compared with $49.7 million in
2000, a decrease of $8.1 million or 16.3%. The decrease was primarily due to the number of secondary offerings, decreasing from 306 in 2000 to 168 in 2001. Initial listing revenues totaled
$35.7 million in 2001 compared with $33.9 million in 2000, an increase of $1.8 million or 5.3%. On a billed basis, initial listing fees totaled $12.6 million in 2001
compared with $53.1 million in 2000, a decrease of $40.5 million or 76.3% primarily due to significantly reduced IPO activity and


capital raising activity by current issuers in 2001. There were 145 new listings including 63 new IPOs in 2001 compared to 579 new listings including 397 new IPOs in 2000.

Other Revenue

For the Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001.

Other revenue totaled $39.4 million in
2002 compared with $45.1 million in 2001, a decrease of $5.7 million or 12.6%. Other revenue primarily includes trademark and licensing revenues related to the QQQ and related products.
Nasdaq earns revenues based on the licensing of the Nasdaq brand name for a variety of financial products in the U.S. and abroad. Among these products are the QQQ, options, futures, mutual funds and a
variety of other products. The QQQ is a unit investment trust that holds shares of the top 100 U.S. and international non-financial stocks listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market that comprise
the Nasdaq-100 Index. The decrease in Other revenue is partially attributable to a decrease in trademark license revenue related to the QQQ occurring outside the Nasdaq InterMarket. This
decline in trademark revenue is effectively offset by the higher tape revenue received by Nasdaq InterMarket, which is reflected in Market Information Services, as a result of its increased market
share. Other revenue was also impacted by a pre-tax charge of $1.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 attributable to the impairment of certain publicly-traded equity securities.
The impairment charge was related to the decline in the fair value of Nasdaq's publicly-traded equity investments below their cost basis that was judged to be
other-than-temporary.

For the Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.

Other revenue totaled $45.1 million in
2001 compared with $23.2 million in 2000, an increase of $21.9 million or 94.4% primarily due to increased trademark and licensing revenue related to the QQQ and related products and
revenue from the Nasdaq MarketSite.

For the Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001.

Direct expenses were $645.1 million in
2002 compared to $694.3 million in 2001, a decrease of $49.2 million or 7.1%.

Compensation
and benefits expense was $192.4 million in 2002 compared with $183.4 million in 2001, an increase of $9.0 million or 4.9%. The increase was primarily
due to increased headcount related to internal functions being handled by Nasdaq as a result of the separation from the NASD as was well as additional benefit obligations, partially offset by staff
reductions. Compensation and benefits expense also included charges of $4.5 million in 2002 and $7.4 million in 2001 for severance and outplacement costs associated with staff reduction
plans. The 2002 staff reductions eliminated 139 positions and the staff reduction in 2001 eliminated 137 positions. Compensation and benefits


expense in 2002 also includes 12 months of compensation and benefits related to employees of Nasdaq Europe of $9.3 million compared to nine months of compensation and benefits expense
of $5.3 million in 2001. Nasdaq Europe was purchased on March 27, 2001.

Marketing
and advertising expense was $27.1 million in 2002 compared with $28.0 million for 2001 a decrease of $0.9 million or 3.2%. The decrease reflects the
carryover into the first quarter of 2001 of Nasdaq's fourth quarter 2000 advertising campaign, which included sponsorship of NFL-based programming shows on CBS television partially offset
by higher marketing and advertising expenses related to Nasdaq's planned "Listed On Nasdaq" marketing campaign in 2002.

Depreciation
and amortization expense was $97.9 million in 2002 compared with $93.4 million in 2001, an increase of $4.5 million or 4.8% primarily due to capacity
and technology infrastructure improvements required to support market activity and new initiatives. In addition, $2.8 million of additional depreciation and amortization expense was recognized
in 2002 as compared to 2001 related to Nasdaq Europe, which was not consolidated until March 27, 2001.

Professional
and contract services expense was $71.4 million in 2002 compared to $76.0 million in 2001, a decrease of $4.6 million or 6.1% primarily due to less
reliance on outside contractors, a decrease in development costs associated with SuperMontage, partially offset by increase in costs associated with Nasdaq's global expansion strategy.

Computer
operations and data communications expense was $147.3 million in 2002 compared with $174.9 million in 2001, a decrease of $27.6 million or 15.8%. This
decrease was primarily due to a renegotiation of Nasdaq's contract with WorldCom that occurred during 2002. Also contributing to the
decrease was lower costs associated with providing computer links to customers due to lower demand for such services as noted in the discussion of "Transaction Services—Access Service
Revenue".

The
provision for bad debts was $8.4 million in 2002 compared with $15.5 million in 2001, a decrease of $7.1 million or 45.8% primarily due to the provision for a
bankruptcy filing by a market data vendor recorded in the first quarter results of 2001. This is partially offset by an increase in inactive issuers with outstanding account balances resulting from
the temporary suspension of certain listing requirements due to the events of September 11, 2001, the continuing erosion of market conditions and increased payment defaults.

Occupancy
expense was $34.4 million in 2002 compared with $27.2 million in 2001, an increase of $7.2 million or 26.5% primarily due to the direct payment of
occupancy expenses to third party vendors previously recorded in support costs from related parties in 2001 as a result of the separation from the NASD.

During
the second quarter of 2002, Nasdaq has recognized an other-than-temporary impairment on its equity investment in Nasdaq Japan of $15.2 million. (See
"Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2" for further discussion.)

The
remaining direct expenses were $51.0 million in 2002 compared with $95.9 million in 2001, a decrease of $44.9 million or 46.8%. The decrease is due to a
non-recurring real estate related costs of $21.5 million recorded during 2001 (See "Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 5" for further discussion). Also contributing to
the decline were lower Nasdaq Japan losses recorded in Other direct expenses in 2002 compared with 2001 due to the other-than-temporary impairment charge on Nasdaq's equity
investment in Nasdaq Japan of $15.2 million which was recorded in the "Nasdaq Japan impairment loss" line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Further contributing to the decline was
a reduction in technology transition costs to $5.3 million in 2002 from $9.2 million in 2001. In conjunction with the separation from the NASD, Nasdaq had committed to fund
$14.5 million of transitional support costs to Amex. In 2001, Nasdaq accrued $9.2 million for such costs. The remaining $5.3 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2002
fulfilling Nasdaq's commitment. Partially


offsetting the decrease were higher NQLX losses of $9.0 million in 2002 as compared to $6.0 million in 2001.

For the Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.

Direct expenses were $694.3 million in
2001 compared with $507.5 million in 2000, an increase of $186.8 million or 36.8%.

Compensation
and benefits expense was $183.4 million in 2001 compared with $137.3 million in 2000, an increase of $46.1 million or 33.6%. The increase is due to a
number of factors, including an increase of approximately $23.2 million in 2001 due to the transfer of positions from the NASD to Nasdaq
associated with Nasdaq's restructuring towards an independent company. In addition to the above, Nasdaq recorded a $7.4 million charge associated with severance and outplacement costs in 2001.
This was the result of the departure of certain senior managers and softening market conditions, which led Nasdaq to implement a staff reduction plan in June 2001 that eliminated 137 positions,
or approximately 10% of the workforce at that time. In addition, direct expenses include $4.0 million of compensation and benefits related to employees of Nasdaq Europe from the date of
acquisition by Nasdaq.

Marketing
and advertising expense was $28.0 million in 2001 compared with $45.9 million for 2000, a decrease of $17.9 million or 39.0% due to reduced spring and fall
advertising campaigns.

Depreciation
and amortization expense was $93.4 million in 2001 compared with $65.6 million for 2000, an increase of $27.8 million or 42.4% primarily due to a higher
overall asset base to support current initiatives, such as SuperMontage and Primex, and the implementation of decimal quoting and trading. Also contributing to the increase was $9.2 million in
depreciation and amortization expense of Nasdaq Europe from the date of acquisition by Nasdaq.

Professional
and contract services expense was $76.0 million in 2001 compared with $61.5 million for 2000, an increase of $14.5 million or 23.6% primarily due to
increased support for SuperMontage and Primex development, and future technology design planning, and costs associated with the Restructuring.

Computer
operations and data communications expense was $174.9 million in 2001 compared with $138.2 million for 2000, an increase of $36.7 million or 26.6%. Costs
related to computer operations increased $4.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2000 to the year ended December 31, 2001 due to increases in maintenance and software
licenses to support a higher asset base. Data communications costs increased $32.2 million due to increased charges for the upgraded bandwidth and processing speed and additional users that are
proportional to the increase in Nasdaq Workstation II revenue as discussed above. Also contributing to the increase is $8.1 million of system operating costs of Nasdaq Europe from the date of
acquisition by Nasdaq.

Provision
for bad debts was $15.5 million in 2001 compared with $5.6 million in 2000, an increase of $9.9 million. The increase is primarily due to an
$8.4 million receivable write-off relating to the bankruptcy filing of a market data vendor in the first quarter of 2001. The remaining increase in provision for bad debts was
proportional to the growth in Nasdaq's accounts receivable.

Occupancy
expense was $27.2 million in 2001 compared with $14.8 million in 2000, an increase of $12.4 million or 83.8% primarily due to Nasdaq's new corporate
offices, located at One Liberty Plaza, New York, New York, new office space in Trumbull, Connecticut and the amortization of leasehold improvements to the Rockville, Maryland data center. These
increased costs were slightly offset by a rent abatement granted to Nasdaq due to the closure of One Liberty Plaza following the events of September 11, 2001.

The
remaining direct expenses were $95.9 million in 2001 compared with $38.6 million in 2000, an increase of $57.3 million primarily due to a
non-recurring real estate related costs of $21.5 million recorded during 2001 (See "Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 5", for further discussion), higher


losses in 2001 from Nasdaq's equity investment in Nasdaq Japan and increased telephone, training and travel expenses. Also contributing to the increase were technology transition costs of
$9.2 million that were accrued for under a commitment by Nasdaq to Amex to fund technology development costs associated with the separation of Amex from Nasdaq. See "Consolidated Financial
Statements, Note 17" for a further explanation of Nasdaq's commitment under the agreement.

Support Costs

Due to its historical relationship with the NASD, Nasdaq currently receives services from the NASD and NASDR, and provides services to the NASD and Amex. As such,
these services are considered related party transactions. Specifically, for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the NASD has provided certain administrative, corporate and
infrastructure services, including certain financial services, real estate, legal and human resource services. NASDR provides surveillance and other regulatory services for Nasdaq. These charges are
composed primarily of the costs relating to technological investments for market surveillance as well as direct costs for enforcement and other regulation services. Nasdaq provides systems and
technology support to Amex in the form of market data storage and dissemination, web development and hosting and customer relationship management application support. Nasdaq also provides security
services to the NASD. During 2002, Nasdaq continued moving towards self-sufficiency and, with the exception of surveillance and regulatory services, it is anticipated that these related
party transactions will continue to diminish. Support costs with related parties have been transacted at the cost of providing the service. See "Item 1. Business—Service, Regulatory, and
Technology Contractual Relationship with the NASD, NASDR and Amex."

For the Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001.

Support costs from related parties were
$75.0 million in 2002 compared with $101.8 million in 2001, a decrease of $26.8 million or 26.3%. The decrease reflects Nasdaq's continued move towards less reliance upon support
from the NASD and its affiliates. Surveillance and other regulatory charges from NASDR were $76.7 million in 2002 compared with $83.8 million in 2001, a decrease of $7.1 million
or 8.5%. Support costs from the NASD were $5.1 million in 2002 compared with $32.1 million in 2001, a decrease of $27.0 million or 84.1%. In addition, the amount of Nasdaq costs
charged to the Amex were $6.8 million in 2002 compared with $14.1 million in 2001, a decrease of $7.3 million or 51.8%. Amounts charged to related parties are netted against
charges from related parties in the "Support costs from related parties, net" line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

For the Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.

Support costs from related parties were
$101.8 million in 2001 compared with $128.5 million in 2000, a decrease of $26.7 million or 20.8%. Surveillance and other regulatory charges from NASDR were $83.8 million
in 2001 compared with $79.8 million in 2000, an increase of $4.0 million or 5.0%. Support costs from the NASD were $32.1 million in 2001 compared
with $53.6 million in 2000, a decrease of $21.5 million or 40.1%. In addition, contributing to the decrease was an increase in the amount of Nasdaq costs charged to the Amex which
totaled $14.1 million in 2001 compared with $4.9 million in 2000, an increase of $9.2 million.

Income Taxes

For the Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001.

Nasdaq's income tax provision was
$41.0 million in 2002 compared with $38.3 million in 2001, an increase of $2.7 million or 7.0%. The effective tax rate was 48.8% for 2002 compared to 48.6% for 2001. The increase
in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a reduction in the tax benefits related to tax preferred investments such as tax exempt interest and dividend received deductions offset by a reduction
in foreign losses for which no tax benefit is taken.


For the Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.

Nasdaq's income tax provision was
$38.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $90.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, a decrease of $52.2 million or 57.7%. The
effective tax rate was 48.6% for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to 42.1% for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in Nasdaq's effective tax rate was primarily due to
its foreign losses for which no tax benefit is taken, offset by the recognition of permanent items for tax preferred investments such as tax-exempt interest and dividends received
deductions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flows

For the Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001.

Cash and cash equivalents and
available-for-sale securities totaled $426.4 million as of December 31, 2002 compared with $521.8 million at December 31, 2001, a decrease of
$95.4 million or 18.3%. Working capital (calculated as current assets, reduced for held-to-maturity investments classified as current assets, less current liabilities)
was $382.9 million at
December 31, 2002 compared with $520.2 million at December 31, 2001, a decrease of $137.3 million or 26.4%.

Cash
and cash equivalents were $204.3 million at December 31, 2002 compared with $293.7 million at December 31, 2001, a decrease of $89.4 million or
30.4% primarily due to cash used in investing activities of $102.5 million and cash used in financing activities of $144.1 million offset by cash provided by operating of
$157.2 million.

Operating
activities provided net cash inflows of $157.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, primarily due to cash received from customers and related parties
less cash paid to suppliers, employees and related parties.

Net
cash used in investing activities was $102.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, primarily due to purchase of $212.6 million of
available-for-sale investments and capital expenditures of $85.4 million related to SuperMontage, investment in global initiatives of $21.8 million and general
capacity increases offset by proceeds of $209.2 million from the redemption of available-for-sale investments.

Cash
used in financing activities was $144.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, primarily due to the payment of approximately $305.2 million to fund the
repurchase of all remaining shares of Common Stock owned by the NASD, except for shares underlying warrants to purchase outstanding shares of Common Stock previously issued by the NASD, as discussed
in the "Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2", offset by an increase in debt of $152.4 million primarily due to a $150.0 million private debt offering in May 2002. These
senior notes are due in 2007.

Nasdaq
believes that the liquidity provided by existing cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations will provide sufficient capital to meet current and
future operating requirements. Nasdaq is exploring alternative sources of financing that may increase liquidity in the future. Nasdaq has generated positive cash flows annually in each of the five
years since 1996 and believes that it will continue to do so in the future to meet both short and long term operating requirements.

For the Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.

Cash and cash equivalents and
available-for-sale securities totaled $521.8 million at December 31, 2001 compared with $494.3 million at December 31, 2000, an increase of
$27.5 million or 5.6%. Working capital was $520.2 million at December 31, 2001 compared with $440.3 million at December 31, 2000 an increase of $79.9 million
or 18.1%.

Cash
and cash equivalents totaled $293.7 million at December 31, 2001 compared with $262.3 million at December 31, 2000 an increase of $31.4 million or
12.0% primarily due to cash


provided by operating activities of $62.6 million and cash provided by financing activities of $78.0 million, partially offset by cash used in investing activities of
$109.2 million.

Operating
activities provided net cash inflows of $62.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, primarily due to cash received from customers less cash paid to
suppliers, employees and related parties and income taxes paid.

Net
cash used in investing activities was $109.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, primarily due to capital expenditures related to SuperMontage, Primex, global
initiatives and general capacity increases. The remaining cash used in investing activities is attributable to purchases of investments with the proceeds from the sale of Common Stock in Phase II of
the Restructuring that closed in January 2001 and receipts from the sales and maturities of investments.

Cash
provided by financing activities was approximately $78.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. On May 3, 2001, Nasdaq sold Subordinated Notes to
Hellman & Friedman, yielding gross proceeds of approximately $240.0 million. Nasdaq used the proceeds to repurchase 18,461,538 shares of Common Stock from the NASD for $13.00 per share
for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $240.0 million. During this period, Nasdaq also received net proceeds from Phase II of the Restructuring that equaled approximately
$63.7 million and repaid approximately $28.6 million to the venture partners who participated in Nasdaq Europe Planning Company Limited. Nasdaq used a portion of the proceeds to
repurchase additional shares from the NASD in 2002 and used the remaining proceeds from its financing activities to invest in new technology, implement and form strategic alliances, implement
competitive pricing of its services, and build its brand through marketing programs.

Liquidity and Capital Adequacy

Nasdaq's Treasury Department manages Nasdaq's capital structure, funding, liquidity, collateral, and relationships with bankers, investment advisors and creditors
on a global basis. The Treasury Department works jointly with subsidiaries to manage internal and external borrowings.

The
Nasdaq Board has approved an investment policy for Nasdaq and its subsidiaries for internally and externally managed portfolios. The goal of the policy is to maintain adequate
liquidity at all times and to fund current budgeted operating and capital requirements and to maximize return. All securities must meet credit ratings as established by the policy, and must be
denominated in subsidiary specific currencies, with maturities up to 24 months, and an average life of not greater than 12 months. The policy prohibits debt interest in any contractor
company where Nasdaq has a material contribution to the business of such company and debt interest in an entity that derives more that 25% of its gross revenue from the combined broker-dealer and/or
investment advisory businesses of all of its
subsidiaries and affiliates. This policy is reviewed annually, and regular reviews of investments and investment managers are also made.

On
August 29, 2002, Nasdaq entered into a $150.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility as amended, (the "Facility"). The Facility, which is syndicated to five banks,
makes $150.0 million available to Nasdaq for a 364-day term. Nasdaq intends to use the Facility for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2002, Nasdaq had not utilized
the Facility, and the entire $150.0 million of the Facility was available. (See "Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 10" for further information.)

During
the first quarter of 2002, Nasdaq repurchased 33.8 million shares of Common Stock from the NASD. This reduction in outstanding shares has a direct impact on the earnings
per share for 2002.

Nasdaq
has pledged certain investments as collateral for a $25.0 million loan to a financial institution. Collateral is limited to U.S. Government and Agency securities with a
margined value of approximately $28.4 million, and is invested in accordance with the note agreement.


The
majority of liquidity for Nasdaq and its subsidiaries is raised by Nasdaq. Nasdaq lends necessary funds from time to time to its equity and consolidated subsidiaries to meet their
working capital requirements.

Contractual Obligations and Contingent Commitments

Nasdaq has contractual obligations to make future payments under long-term debt and long-term non-cancelable lease agreements
and has contingent commitments under a variety of arrangements as discussed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table sets forth these contractual obligations as of
December 31, 2002:

In
May 1997, Nasdaq entered into a $25.0 million note payable with a financial institution. Principal payments are scheduled to begin in 2007 and continue in equal monthly
installments until maturity in 2012.

On
March 27, 2001, Nasdaq acquired 68.2% of Nasdaq Europe and accounted for this acquisition under the purchase method of accounting. As of December 31, 2002, Nasdaq owned
approximately a 59.4% interest in Nasdaq Europe. Nasdaq Europe has $26.0 million of notes payable outstanding with third parties as of December 31, 2002. Principal payments are scheduled
in 2003 and 2004. Nasdaq Europe also has $21.7 million of intercompany loans with Nasdaq outstanding as of December 31, 2002. Nasdaq funded these loans to finance the operations of
Nasdaq Europe for 2002 and to enable Nasdaq Europe to invest in Nasdaq Deutschland AG, a venture among Nasdaq Europe, several German banks and two regional German exchanges (See "Consolidated
Financial Statements, Note 17" for further discussion). Nasdaq has agreed to convert the intercompany loans from debt to equity if the majority of the European strategic partners also convert
their debt to equity. In October 2002, Nasdaq Europe's strategic investors committed to convert approximately $18.6 million or 73.8% of Nasdaq Europe's external debt to equity
($44.5 million or 87.1% including intercompany debt with Nasdaq). The conversion was formally approved by Nasdaq Europe's Board in March 2003 and is expected to close in May 2003.

On
May 3, 2001, Nasdaq issued and sold $240 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.0% convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 to Hellman & Friedman. See
"Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 11" for further information on the Subordinated Notes.

On
May 9, 2002, Nasdaq issued and sold $150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.83% senior notes due 2007 (the "Senior Notes") in a private placement. The
Senior Notes are unsecured, pay interest quarterly, and may be redeemed by Nasdaq at any time, subject to a make-whole amount. The proceeds from the Senior Notes, approximately
$149.0 million after payment of placement agent commissions and expenses of this offering, were used to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid to the NASD in the Repurchase and for
general corporate purposes.


On August 29, 2002, Nasdaq entered into the Facility, a $150.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The Facility, which is syndicated to five banks, makes
$150.0 million available to Nasdaq for a 364-day term. Nasdaq intends to use the Facility for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2002, Nasdaq had not utilized the
Facility, and the entire $150.0 million of the Facility was available. (See "Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 10" for further information).

Nasdaq
has agreed to guarantee the provision of certain support and maintenance services for the trading platform to be operated by Nasdaq Deutschland AG in the event Nasdaq Europe no
longer provides such services due to circumstances including its liquidation or winding down. Nasdaq's obligation to provide services would continue for a period of 18 months from the date the
guarantee is triggered, but in no event longer than three years from the date trading begins on the Nasdaq Deutschland exchange. Nasdaq will be obligated to perform under the guarantee only if Nasdaq
Deutschland satisfies certain conditions, including minimum quarterly order flow requirements for periods starting in the fourth quarter of 2003. Nasdaq estimates the maximum cost of providing the
services at €14.7 million ($15.4 million) over the term of the guarantee.

Nasdaq
leases certain office space and equipment in connection with its operations. The majority of these leases contain escalation clauses based on increases in property taxes and
building operating costs. Minimum lease payments at December 31, 2002 were $290.9 million.

As
of December 31, 2002, Nasdaq had future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable capital leases of $13.5 million.

The
Nasdaq Board has approved a capital contribution of up to $25.0 million to the NQLX joint venture. Nasdaq made a $2.0 million capital contribution in 2001. During 2002,
Nasdaq made additional contributions to NQLX of $16.0 million. An additional $7.0 million is expected to be contributed in 2003, which will fulfill Nasdaq Board's initial approval of
$25.0 million.

In
December 2002, Nasdaq purchased the NASD's 50.0% interest in the NASD Insurance Agency (subsequently renamed the Nasdaq Insurance Agency, LLC ("NIA")). Nasdaq's consideration
for the NASD's 50.0% interest consisted of an upfront payment of $0.5 million and up to $5.1 million based on NIA's stream of contingent cash flow through 2011. Nasdaq will pay
(a) 20% of NIA's cash flows until Nasdaq has paid the NASD $2.3 million from cash flows; (b) 10% of NIA's cash flows until Nasdaq has
paid the NASD a cumulative amount of $3.0 million from cash flows; (c) 5% of NIA's cash flows until Nasdaq has paid the NASD the full cumulative amount of $5.1 million from cash
flows.

During
2001, Nasdaq agreed to fund a portion of the necessary expenses related to the separation of software, hardware and data under a plan to transition technology applications and
support from Nasdaq to Amex. The NASD originally integrated certain Nasdaq and Amex technology subsequent to the 1998 acquisition of Amex by the NASD. The total estimated cost of the separation had
been established at a maximum of $29.0 million, and was to be shared evenly between Nasdaq and the NASD. In 2002 and 2001, Nasdaq accrued $5.3 million and $9.2 million,
respectively under this commitment fulfilling its commitment. As of December 31, 2002, $3.7 million has been paid to Amex.

Nasdaq
entered into a six-year $600.0 million contract with WorldCom in 1997 to replace the data network that connected the Nasdaq market facilities to market
participants. As part of that contract, Nasdaq provided a guaranteed revenue commitment to WorldCom of $300.0 million. Nasdaq was permitted to renegotiate the contract once the minimum
guarantee was satisfied. In June 2002, an amendment to the original contract was negotiated with WorldCom once the minimum usage level of $300.0 million was achieved from the original
contract. The amended contract supersedes the terms of the existing contract and is for $182.0 million over three years commencing June 2002. The three-year contract includes
fixed and variable cost components for two years. Pursuant to the agreement, however, Nasdaq has the right to terminate the contract in certain circumstances after the second year.


Although WorldCom declared bankruptcy in July 2002, Nasdaq does not foresee any interruption in service under the contract.

Nasdaq
may be subject to claims arising out of the conduct of its business. Currently, there are certain legal proceedings pending against Nasdaq. Nasdaq believes, based upon the opinion
of counsel, that any liabilities or settlements arising from these proceedings will not have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of Nasdaq. Management is not aware of
any unasserted claims or assessments that would have a material adverse effect on the financial position and the results of operations of Nasdaq.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk

Market risk represents the risks of changes in the value of a financial instrument, derivative or non-derivative, caused by fluctuations in interest
rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity prices. As of December 31, 2002, Nasdaq's investment portfolio consists primarily of floating rate securities, obligations of U.S. Government sponsored
enterprises, municipal bonds, and commercial paper. Nasdaq's primary market risk is associated with fluctuations in interest rates and the effects that such fluctuations may have on its investment
portfolio and outstanding debt. The weighted average maturity of the fixed income portion of the portfolio is 1.21 years as of December 31, 2002. Nasdaq's outstanding debt obligations
generally specify fixed interest rates until May 2007 and a floating interest rate based on the lender's cost of funds until maturity in 2012. The investment portfolio is held primarily in
short-term investments with maturities averaging approximately one to five years. Therefore, management does not believe that a 100 basis point fluctuation in market interest rates will
have a material effect on the carrying value of Nasdaq's investment portfolio or on Nasdaq earnings or cash flows. Nasdaq's exposure to these risks has not materially changed since December 31,
2002.

Nasdaq
also has exposure to foreign currency translation gains and losses, primarily Euro to U.S. Dollar, due to its subsidiaries and equity method investments. During the year 2002,
Nasdaq had hedged certain foreign currency exposures although no hedges currently existed at December 31, 2002. Nasdaq expects to periodically re-evaluate its foreign currency
hedging policies and may choose in the future to enter into additional transactions.

Critical Accounting Policies

Nasdaq's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which requires the use
of estimates and assumptions (See "Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3"). Nasdaq believes the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect the more significant judgments
and estimates used in the preparation of the statements:

Revenue Recognition.

Market Information Services revenues (25.3% of total revenues in 2002) are based
on the number of presentation devices in service and quotes delivered through those devices. These revenues are recorded net of amounts due under revenue sharing arrangements with market participants.
Market information services revenues are recognized in the month that information is provided. Transaction services revenues (47.6% of total revenues in 2002) are variable based on service volumes and
are recognized as transactions occur. Corporate Client Group revenues (22.1% of total revenues in 2002) are recognized over each respective estimated services periods. Annual fee revenue are
recognized ratably over the following 12-month period. Effective January 1, 2000, initial listing and LAS fees are recognized in accordance with SAB 101 on a
straight-line basis over estimated service periods, which are six and four years, respectively. These estimated service periods are based on historical average listing lives of issuers.
Prior to 2000, initial listing fees were recognized in the month listing occurred and LAS fees were recognized in the period the incremental shares were issued. The


change in accounting for these fees is more fully described in the "Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4". Nasdaq continues to periodically re-evaluate its estimated service
periods.

Software Costs.

Significant purchased application software, and operational software that is an
integral part of computer hardware, are capitalized and amortized on the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, generally two to seven years. All other purchased software
is charged to expense as incurred.

Nasdaq
uses Statement of Position 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use" ("SOP 98-1"), for accounting for
internally developed software. SOP 98-1 requires that certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining internal use software be capitalized. Under the provisions of this
SOP, Nasdaq capitalizes internal and third party costs incurred in connection with the development of internal use software.

Related Party Transactions.

Related party receivables and payables are the result of various
transactions between Nasdaq and its affiliates. Payables to related parties are comprised primarily of the regulation charge from NASDR, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the NASD. NASDR charges Nasdaq for
costs incurred related to Nasdaq market regulation and enforcement. Support charges from the NASD to Nasdaq represent another significant component of payables to related parties. The support charge
includes an allocation of a portion of the NASD's administrative expenses as well as its costs incurred to develop and maintain technology on behalf of Nasdaq. The remaining component of payables to
related parties is cash disbursements funded by the NASD on behalf of Nasdaq. All related party transactions are currently charged at cost.

Receivables
from related parties are primarily attributable to costs incurred by Amex and funded by Nasdaq related to various Amex technology projects. The remaining portion of the
receivable from related parties balance is related to cash disbursements funded by Nasdaq on behalf of its affiliates.

Until
Exchange Registration, the NASD will retain voting control over Nasdaq. See "Item 1. Business—Nasdaq's History and Structure". In addition, four of the 19 members of
the Nasdaq Board are currently members of the NASD Board. Until Exchange Registration, the NASD will be in a position to continue to control substantially all matters affecting Nasdaq, including any
determination with respect to the direction and policies of Nasdaq, acquisition or disposition of assets, future issuances of securities of Nasdaq, Nasdaq's incurrence of debt, and any dividend
payable on the Common Stock.

Conflicts
of interest may arise between Nasdaq and the NASD, or its affiliates, in a number of areas relating to their past and ongoing relationships, including the nature, quality, and
pricing of services rendered; shared marketing functions; tax and employee benefit matters; indemnity agreements; sales or distributions by the NASD of all or any portion of its ownership interest in
Nasdaq; or the NASD's ability to influence certain affairs of Nasdaq prior to Exchange Registration.

Nasdaq
has agreed to fund a portion of the necessary expenses related to the separation of software, hardware, and data under a plan to transition technology applications and support
from Nasdaq to Amex. The NASD originally integrated Nasdaq and Amex technology subsequent to the 1998 acquisition of Amex by the NASD. The total estimated cost of the separation has been established
at a maximum of $29.0 million, and is to be shared evenly between Nasdaq and the NASD. Nasdaq accrued $9.2 million of its $14.5 million commitment as of December 31, 2001.
The remaining $5.3 million was accrued for during 2002 fulfilling Nasdaq's commitment.

Provision for Bad Debts.

Nasdaq evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a
combination of factors. In circumstances where a specific customer's inability to meet its financial obligations is known (bankruptcy filings, substantial downgrading of credit scores), Nasdaq records
a specific provision for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount it


reasonably believes will be collected. For all other customers, provisions for bad debts are made based on the length of time the receivable is past due and historical experience. For receivables
past due over 60, 90, and 120 days, the outstanding account balances are reserved for at 10%, 50%, and 100% of the outstanding account balances, respectively. If circumstances change (i.e.,
higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer's ability to pay), our estimates of recoverability could be reduced by a material amount.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities" ("SFAS 146"). SFAS 146 requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the
liability is incurred. SFAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. Nasdaq does not expect the adoption of SFAS 146 to have a
material impact on its earnings and financial position.

In
November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others" ("FIN 45"). FIN 45 provides accounting and disclosure requirements for certain guarantees. The interpretation requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value versus the current
practice of recording a liability only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. The accounting provisions of FIN 45 are effective for certain guarantees issued or modified beginning
January 1, 2003. Nasdaq does not expect the interpretation to have a material impact on its earnings and financial position.

In
January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46"). FIN 46 addresses consolidation by business enterprises of
variable interest entities ("VIE"s). The accounting provisions and disclosure requirements of FIN 46 are effective immediately for VIEs created after January 31, 2003 and are effective for
reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2003 for VIEs created prior to February 1, 2003. Nasdaq does not expect the interpretation to have a material impact on its earnings and
financial position.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Board
of Directors

The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. ("Nasdaq") as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of Nasdaq's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Nasdaq at December 31,
2002 and 2001, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.

As
discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2000, Nasdaq changed its method of accounting for certain Corporate Client Group
services revenue.

The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.    Organization and Nature of Operations

The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. ("Nasdaq") operates the world's largest electronic screen-based equity securities market and the world's largest equity
securities market based on share volume. Nasdaq is the parent company of Nasdaq Global Holdings ("Nasdaq Global"); Quadsan Enterprises, Inc. ("Quadsan"); Nasdaq Financial Products
Services, Inc. ("Nasdaq Financial Products"); Nasdaq International Market Initiatives, Inc. ("NIMI"); and Nasdaq Canada, Inc. ("Nasdaq Canada") collectively referred to as
"Nasdaq". These entities are wholly-owned by Nasdaq. Nasdaq Tools Inc. ("Nasdaq Tools"), previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nasdaq, was merged with and into Nasdaq on July 31, 2002
(See Note 2, Significant Transactions, for further discussion). At December 31, 2002, Nasdaq also owned approximately a 59.4% interest in Nasdaq Europe S.A./N.V. ("Nasdaq Europe") and a
50.0% interest in Nasdaq LIFFE Markets, LLC ("NQLX").

Nasdaq
Global, which is incorporated in Switzerland, is the holding company for Nasdaq's investments in IndigoMarkets

sm

Ltd. ("IndigoMarkets") and Nasdaq
Japan, Inc. ("Nasdaq Japan"), in which Nasdaq Global had 55.0% and 39.7% interests, respectively, as of December 31, 2002. During the second quarter of 2002, Nasdaq recognized an
other-than-temporary impairment of its investment in Nasdaq Japan. On August 16, 2002 the Board of Directors of Nasdaq Japan voted to take the company to dormant status,
effectively ceasing operations (See Note 2, Significant Transactions, for further discussion). Nasdaq Europe Planning Company, Limited ("Nasdaq Europe Planning") is owned by Nasdaq Global and
Nasdaq. Nasdaq Europe Planning was formed to expand Nasdaq into the European community; however, it has been inactive due to the purchase of Nasdaq's interest in Nasdaq Europe. Nasdaq Europe is a
pan-European market headquartered in Brussels. Nasdaq International Ltd. ("Nasdaq International"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nasdaq Global, is a London based marketing company.
Quadsan is a Delaware investment holding company that provides investment management services for Nasdaq. Nasdaq Financial Products is the sponsor of the Nasdaq-100 Trust. Nasdaq Financial
Product Services (Ireland) Limited ("Nasdaq Ireland") is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nasdaq Financial Products. Nasdaq Ireland is the manager of The Nasdaq Exchange Traded Fund PLC. NIMI offers a
variety of consulting services to assist emerging and established securities markets around the world with both technology applications and regulation. Nasdaq Canada was created to
develop a new securities market within Canada under a cooperative agreement with the Provincial Government of Quebec.

Nasdaq
is a majority owned subsidiary of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD"). At a special meeting of the NASD members held on April 14, 2000,
a majority of NASD members approved a plan to broaden the ownership in Nasdaq through a two-phase private placement to all NASD members, Nasdaq issuers and institutional investor firms.
The two phases consisted of (1) newly-issued shares of Nasdaq common stock, $.01 par value per share (the "Common Stock") and (2) additional shares of Common Stock and warrants to
purchase shares of outstanding common stock owned by the NASD (the transactions collectively, the "Restructuring"). The Restructuring was intended, among other things, to strategically realign the
ownership of Nasdaq, minimize potential conflicts of interest between Nasdaq and NASD Regulation, Inc. ("NASDR") and allow Nasdaq to respond to current and future competitive challenges caused
by technological advances and the increasing globalization of financial markets.

In
connection with the first phase of the Restructuring ("Phase I"); (1) the NASD separated the American Stock Exchange LLC ("Amex") from The Nasdaq-Amex Market
Group, Inc. ("Market Group"), a holding company that was a subsidiary of the NASD; (2) Market Group was merged with and into Nasdaq; (3) Nasdaq effected a
49,999-for-one stock dividend creating 100 million shares of

F-7

Common Stock outstanding (all of which were initially owned by the NASD); and (4) Nasdaq authorized the issuance of an additional 30.9 million new shares to be offered for sale by
Nasdaq. All share and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock dividend.

Phase
I closed on June 28, 2000 with Nasdaq selling 23.7 million of its newly issued shares, yielding net proceeds of approximately $253.3 million. As of
December 31, 2000, the NASD owned approximately 81% of Nasdaq on a non-diluted basis.

The
second phase of the Restructuring ("Phase II") closed on January 18, 2001, with Nasdaq selling approximately 5.0 million shares, yielding net proceeds of approximately
$63.7 million. At December 31, 2001, the NASD owned approximately 69% of Nasdaq on a non-diluted basis and 25% on a fully-diluted basis. This reflected the sale by the NASD
of 4.5 million shares of Common Stock and warrants to purchase 43.2 million shares of Common Stock in Phases I and II of the Restructuring, the repurchase by Nasdaq of
18.5 million shares of Common Stock from the NASD in May 2001 and the assumed conversion of all potentially dilutive securities.

On
March 8, 2002, Nasdaq completed a two-stage repurchase (the "Repurchase") of 33,768,895 million shares of Common Stock owned by the NASD, which represented
all of the remaining outstanding shares of Common Stock owned by the NASD, except for the 43,225,976 million shares of Common Stock underlying the warrants issued by the NASD in Phase I and II.
Nasdaq purchased the Common Stock for approximately $305.2 million in aggregate cash consideration, 1,338,402 million shares of Nasdaq's Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock (face
and liquidation value of $100 per share, plus any
accumulated unpaid dividends) and one share of Nasdaq's Series B Preferred Stock, (face and liquidation value of $1.00 per share). The NASD owns all of the outstanding shares of Series A
and Series B Preferred Stock. All of the shares of Common Stock repurchased by Nasdaq from the NASD are no longer outstanding and are held in Common Stock in treasury. At December 31,
2002, the NASD owned approximately 55.2% of Nasdaq on a non-diluted basis and 0.0% on a diluted basis (assuming the full exercise of all warrants purchased in Phase I and II of the
Restructuring).

Nasdaq
operates in one segment as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 131, "Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information."
Nasdaq uses a multiple market participant system to operate an electronic, screen-based equity market. Nasdaq's principal business products are Transaction Services, Market Information Services and
the Corporate Client Group. The majority of this business is transacted with companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market, market data vendors and firms in the broker-dealer industry within the U.S.

2.    Significant Transactions

Repurchase of Shares from the NASD

On March 8, 2002, Nasdaq completed the Repurchase by purchasing 33,768,895 shares of Nasdaq's Common Stock owned by the NASD, which represented all of the
remaining outstanding shares of Common Stock owned by the NASD, except for the 43,225,976 shares of Common Stock underlying the warrants issued by the NASD as part of the Restructuring. Nasdaq
purchased the Common Stock for approximately $305.2 million in aggregate cash consideration, 1,338,402 shares of Nasdaq's Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock (face and liquidation value
of $100 per share, plus any accumulated unpaid dividends) and one share of Nasdaq's Series B Preferred Stock, (face and liquidation value of $1.00 per share). The NASD owns all of the
outstanding shares of Series A and Series B Preferred Stock. All of the shares of Common Stock repurchased by Nasdaq from the NASD have been placed into Common Stock in treasury. (See
Note 19, Capital Stock, for further discussion.)

F-8

Nasdaq Common Stock

On July 1, 2002, the Common Stock of Nasdaq began trading under the symbol "NDAQ" on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. The
limited trading of the security began upon the expiration of the contractual transfer restrictions imposed in connection with the sale of Common Stock by Nasdaq and
the NASD in Phase I and Phase II of the Restructuring that occurred in June 2000 and January 2001, respectively.

Nasdaq Japan

During the second quarter of 2002, Nasdaq recognized an other-than-temporary impairment of its investment in Nasdaq Japan. Nasdaq
recognized this impairment as a result of the depressed level of market activity in Japan, combined with the suspension of Nasdaq Japan's hybrid trading system due to the inability to gain exchange
approval of market rules and industry participation. These conditions led management to conclude that Nasdaq Japan would not be profitable in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, Nasdaq Japan did not
have the capacity to raise capital to fund its operations beyond 2002. Thus, Nasdaq Japan's financial liabilities to Nasdaq were not expected to be repaid and were recognized as a loss.

The
net impact of the other-than-temporary impairment on Nasdaq's pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $15.2 million.
This represented a complete write-down of the investment, outstanding and unfunded loans (an additional $6.0 million was loaned and $7.0 million was committed during the
second quarter of 2002), foreign exchange translation losses and other receivables, partially offset by a re-valuation of certain variable Nasdaq Japan stock based awards of approximately
$7.9 million.

On
August 16, 2002, the Board of Directors of Nasdaq Japan voted to take the company to dormant status, effectively ceasing operations. Shareholders of Nasdaq Japan subsequently
ratified this decision. Nasdaq Japan is currently in liquidation status and is expected to be completely dissolved in the second quarter of 2003. Companies listed on the Nasdaq Japan market retained
their listing on the Osaka Exchange and experienced no disruption to trading.

Nasdaq Tools

On July 31, 2002, Nasdaq Tools, which provides software products and services related to the broker-dealer industry to be used in conjunction with Nasdaq
Workstation II software, was merged into Nasdaq in a statutory merger under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Nasdaq Tools was previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nasdaq.
Nasdaq Tools now operates as a part of Nasdaq's Transaction Services business products. Prior to July 31, 2002, revenue from Nasdaq Tools was disclosed as Other revenue. As such, prior period
amounts have been reclassified to Transaction Services to conform with the current period presentation.

Nasdaq Deutschland

On October 30, 2002, Nasdaq's majority-owned subsidiary, Nasdaq Europe, and the Berlin and Bremen Stock Exchanges, as well as comdirekt bank, Commerzbank
and Dresdner Bank, signed definitive agreements dated as of October 4, 2002 to recapitalize Bremer Wertpapierbörse AG, a German stock exchange, that will be rebranded as "Nasdaq
Deutschland AG" and that will be marketed under the Nasdaq brand. The recapitalization of Bremer Wertpapierbörse AG was finalized on January 21, 2003. This exchange, which will
be subject to the German public law entity resulting from the merger of the Bremen Stock Exchange and the Berlin Stock Exchange, will initially be majority-owned by Nasdaq Europe. Trading in German
and international blue chip and growth stocks began on March 21, 2003. Nasdaq has agreed to guarantee the provision of certain support and maintenance services for Nasdaq Deutschland's trading
platform for a limited period in certain

F-9

circumstances if Nasdaq Europe no longer provides such services. (See Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, for further discussion.)

Nasdaq Member Revenue Sharing

Effective June 1, 2002, Nasdaq terminated its market data revenue sharing program for securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market, as a result of the
SEC's decision to abrogate certain market participant tape sharing pilot programs. The SEC's action was in response to concerns about the effect of market data rebates on the accuracy of market data
and the regulatory functions of self-regulatory organizations. The SEC's action allows Nasdaq and competing exchanges to retain tape revenue. Nasdaq continues to share market data revenue
with the exchanges that participate in the Unlisted Trading Privileges ("UTP") Plan based on their respective share of volume and trades of securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. In addition,
Nasdaq InterMarket continues to share tape revenue with Nasdaq market participants who report trades in NYSE and Amex listed securities through Nasdaq.

In conjunction with settling various issues associated with the Restructuring, the NASD made a payment to Nasdaq in the amount of $5.6 million during the
first quarter of 2002. Nasdaq treated the payment as a contribution and reflected it in Additional paid-in capital on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. In addition, during
December 2002, Nasdaq purchased the NASD's 50.0% interest in the NASD Insurance Agency, LLC (subsequently renamed the Nasdaq Insurance Agency, LLC) for $0.5 million. The payment was
recorded as a distribution to the NASD. Nasdaq accounts for its investment in the Nasdaq Insurance Agency under the equity method of accounting. The agency provides insurance brokerage services and
specializes in the director and officer liability insurance market.

Reduction in Force

During 2002, Nasdaq recorded a charge of $4.5 million for severance and outplacement costs associated with staff reduction plans. In the first quarter of
2002, a charge of $0.9 million was recorded and 34 positions were eliminated. In the fourth quarter of 2002, a charge of $3.6 million was recorded and 105 positions were eliminated.

Hellman & Friedman Capital Partners, IV

On May 3, 2001, Nasdaq issued and sold $240.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.0% convertible subordinated notes due 2006 (the
"Subordinated Notes") to Hellman & Friedman Capital Partners IV, L.P. and certain of its affiliated limited partnerships (collectively, "Hellman & Friedman"). Nasdaq used the proceeds
from the sale of the Subordinated Notes to purchase 18,461,538 shares of Common Stock from the NASD for $13.00 per share. On November 12, 2001, Nasdaq sold an aggregate amount of 500,000 shares
of Common Stock to Hellman & Friedman for an aggregate offering price of $5,125,000, which was the fair value at that date. (See Note 11, Subordinated Notes, and Note 19, Capital
Stock, for further discussions.)

Nasdaq Europe S.A./N.V.

On March 27, 2001, Nasdaq acquired a majority ownership interest in the European Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation S.A./N.V., a
pan-European stock market headquartered in Brussels, for approximately $12.5 million. Nasdaq renamed the company Nasdaq Europe S.A./N.V. ("Nasdaq Europe") as part of a plan to
restructure it into a globally linked, pan-European market. Nasdaq's acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, resulting in the initial recording of goodwill
of approximately $4.7 million. During 2001, Nasdaq purchased an

F-10

additional 2.0% ownership of Nasdaq Europe for approximately $6.0 million and sold 1.2% of its ownership in Nasdaq Europe to a third party. Also during 2001, Nasdaq Europe sold additional
shares representing a 9.0% ownership interest for approximately $13.9 million to third party investors. In the first quarter of 2002, Nasdaq Europe sold additional shares to a third party,
resulting in an increase of $0.7 million to Nasdaq's stockholders' equity.

In
October 2002, Nasdaq Europe's strategic investors committed to convert approximately $18.6 million or 73.8% of Nasdaq Europe's external debt to equity
($44.5 million or 87.1% including intercompany debt with Nasdaq). The conversion was formally approved by Nasdaq Europe's Board in March 2003 and is expected to close in May 2003.
After the conversion is completed, Nasdaq will have a 60.3% ownership interest in Nasdaq Europe.

Nasdaq Europe Planning Company Limited

In February 2000, the NASD formed a joint venture, Nasdaq Europe Planning, with three partners, whereby each partner contributed $10.0 million in
cash. Nasdaq Europe Planning's proposed joint venture did not occur due to a strategic decision to pursue a strategy for European expansion through the acquisition in March 2001 of a
controlling interest in Nasdaq Europe rather than through Nasdaq Europe Planning. As a result, Nasdaq agreed to repurchase the ownership interests of the three other shareholders in Nasdaq Europe
Planning for $10.0 million each, thereby unwinding the joint venture. The repurchase of two of the shareholders was completed in the first quarter of 2001 for cash payments of
$10.0 million each. The repurchase from the third shareholder was completed in the fourth quarter of 2001 for aggregate consideration estimated at $10.0 million, comprised of cash of
$7.4 million, a warrant to purchase up to 479,648 shares of Common Stock, and 7,211 shares of Nasdaq Europe. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, Nasdaq owned 100.0% of Nasdaq Europe
Planning.

Nasdaq LIFFE Markets, LLC

On June 1, 2001, Nasdaq signed an agreement with the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange ("LIFFE") creating NQLX, a U.S. joint
venture company to list and trade single stock futures. On November 8, 2002, Nasdaq launched NQLX, an electronic exchange offering a broad range of futures contracts. NQLX is an independent
exchange. (See Note 8, Joint Ventures and Equity Method Investments, for further discussion.)

3.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Nasdaq and its majority and wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All non-majority owned investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks and all non-restricted highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months
or less at the time of purchase. Such equivalent

F-11

investments included in cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $195.1 million and $280.1 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Cash
equivalents are carried at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.

Investments

Under SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," ("SFAS 115") management determines the appropriate
classification of investments at the time of purchase. Investments for which Nasdaq does not have the intent or ability to hold to maturity are classified as
"available-for-sale" and are carried at fair market value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity.
Investments for which Nasdaq has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as "held-to-maturity" and are carried at amortized cost. The amortized cost of debt
securities classified as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, which are included
in interest income. Realized gains and losses on sales of securities are included in earnings using the specific identification method.

Nasdaq
regularly monitors and evaluates the realizable value of its securities portfolio. When assessing securities for other-than-temporary declines in value,
Nasdaq considers such factors as, among other things, the duration to which the market value had been less than cost, the performance of the investee's stock price in relation to the stock price of
its competitors within the industry and the market in general, any news that has been released specific to the investee and the outlook for the overall industry in which the investee operates. Nasdaq
also reviews the financial statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties. If events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of these
assets has occurred and is deemed to be other- than-temporary, the carrying value of the security is reduced to its fair value and the impairment is charged to earnings.

Receivables, net

Nasdaq's receivables are concentrated with NASD member firms, market data vendors and Nasdaq-listed companies. Receivables are shown net of reserves for
uncollectable accounts. Reserves are calculated based on the age and source of the underlying receivable and are tied to past collections experience. Total reserves netted against receivables in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets were $5.9 million and $7.4 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Land is recorded at cost. Equipment
acquired under capital leases is recorded at the lower of fair market value or the present value of future lease payments. Depreciation is generally recognized over the estimated useful lives of the
related assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining term of the related lease. Depreciation and amortization are computed by the
straight-line method. Depreciation expense was $91.6 million, $82.4 million and $60.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

Property
and equipment includes capital leases of $22.6 million and $26.9 million, and accumulated amortization of $10.5 million each for the years ending
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses
acquired. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142") in the first quarter of fiscal 2002,

F-12

goodwill and certain intangibles will no longer be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually. Based on the impairment tests performed, there was no impairment of goodwill as of
December 31, 2002. There can be no assurance that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings. For the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 goodwill and
other intangible assets were amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from five to 10 years. Nasdaq evaluates the recoverability of
intangible assets and takes into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate an impairment exists. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, goodwill
and other intangibles were $16.6 million and $19.4 million, respectively. Goodwill amortization expense was $1.6 million and $1.1 million for the years ended
December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Other intangible asset amortization expense was $2.6 million, $2.4 million and $2.0 million for the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that long-lived assets or other assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be
performed. If an evaluation were required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset's carrying amount to determine if a
write-down is required. If a write-down were required, Nasdaq would prepare a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the amount of the write-down.

Revenue Recognition

Transaction services revenue is variable, and is based on service volumes, and is recognized as transactions occur. Market information services revenue is based
on the number of presentation devices in service and market data information quotes delivered through those devices. This revenue is recorded net of amounts due under revenue sharing arrangements with
market participants. Market information services revenue is recognized in the month that information is provided. Corporate Client Group revenue includes annual fees, initial listing fees and listing
of additional shares ("LAS") fees. Annual fees are recognized ratably over the following 12-month period. Effective January 1, 2000, initial listing and LAS fees are recognized on a
straight-line basis over estimated service periods, which are six and four years, respectively. Prior to 2000, initial listing fees were recognized in the month listing occurred and LAS
fees were recognized in the period the additional shares were issued. (See Note 4, Change in Accounting Principle, for further discussion.)

Stock Compensation

Nasdaq accounts for stock option grants in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," ("APB
25"). Nasdaq grants stock options with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the stock at the date of the grant, and accordingly, recognizes no compensation expense related to such
grants. Pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value method had been applied in measuring compensation expense is provided in Note 14, Stock Compensation and
Stock Awards.

Deferred Revenue

Deferred revenue represents cash received and billed receivables for Corporate Client Group, which are unearned until services are provided.

Advertising Costs

Nasdaq expenses advertising costs, which include media advertising and production costs, in the periods in which the costs are incurred. Media advertising and
production costs included as marketing

F-13

and advertising in the Consolidated Statements of Income totaled $13.4 million, $13.8 million and $35.3 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Software Costs

Significant purchased application software and operational software that is an integral part of computer hardware are capitalized and amortized on the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, generally two to seven years. All other purchased software is charged to expense as incurred.

The
provisions of Statement of Position 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use" ("SOP 98-1") require certain
costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining internal use software to be capitalized. Unamortized capitalized software development costs of $70.2 million and $65.2 million
as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, are carried in data processing equipment and software in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amortization of costs capitalized under SOP
98-1 totaled $14.3 million, $7.0 million and $2.3 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and are included in depreciation and amortization in the Consolidated
Statements of Income. Additions to capitalized software were $19.3 million and $39.3 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Income Taxes

Nasdaq and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return and all applicable state and local returns. Nasdaq uses the asset
and liability method required by SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes", to provide income taxes on all transactions recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities (i.e., temporary differences) and are measured
at the enacted rates that will be in effect when these differences are realized. If necessary, a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than
not to be realized.

Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate in a local currency environment are translated to U.S. dollars at exchange rates in
effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are charged or credited to other
comprehensive income. Foreign currency translation also includes the translation of gains and losses for non-U.S. equity method investments.

Minority Interests

Minority interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets represent the minority owners' share of equity as of the balance sheet date. Minority interests in the
Consolidated Statements of Income represent the minority owners' share of the income or loss of certain consolidated subsidiaries, principally Nasdaq Europe and IndigoMarkets. See Note 2,
Significant Transactions, for further discussion of Nasdaq Europe's conversion of debt to equity.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year balances in order to conform to the current year presentation.

4.    Change in Accounting Principle

On August 17, 2001, Nasdaq concluded discussions with the SEC with respect to the implementation in its financial statements of Staff Accounting Bulletin
101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" ("SAB 101"), which became effective for SEC public reporting companies in the fourth quarter of 2000. Nasdaq became a SEC public reporting company on
June 29, 2001, the effective date of its Registration Statement on Form 10. As a result of discussions with the SEC, Nasdaq changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition for
certain components of its Corporate Client Group revenue.

In
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, as SAB 101 was adopted effective the fourth quarter of 2000, the change in accounting principle has been
applied as of January 1, 2000. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance prior to SAB 101, Nasdaq recognized revenue for issuer initial listing fees and LAS fees in the month the
listing occurred or in the period additional shares were issued, respectively. Nasdaq now recognizes revenue related to initial listing fees and LAS fees on a straight-line basis over
estimated service periods, which are six and four years, respectively.

As
a result of the adoption of SAB 101, Nasdaq recognized a one-time cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2000. This cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle decreased net income for the year ended December 31, 2000 by $101.1 million ($0.90 per share) resulting in net income of $23.3 million
($0.21 per share). The adjustment to December 31, 2000 net income for the cumulative change to prior years' results consists of the following:

As
a result of the change in accounting principle, for the year ended December 31, 2000, revenue decreased $35.5 million and pro forma net income, excluding the cumulative
change in accounting principle, decreased $20.8 million ($0.19 per share).

For
the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, Nasdaq recognized $31.6 million, $44.9 million, and $55.7 million in revenue, respectively, that was
included in the cumulative effect adjustment as of January 1, 2000. This revenue contributed $19.2 million (after income taxes of $12.4 million), $27.3 million (after
income taxes of $17.6 million), and $33.3 million (after income taxes of $22.4 million), to net income for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

5.    Real Estate Developments

During the fourth quarter of 2001, as a result of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Nasdaq decided to relocate its New York City headquarters
from One Liberty Plaza, which was adjacent to the site where the World Trade Center Towers stood, to a location closer to its Times Square MarketSite Building. As of December 31, 2001, Nasdaq
was obligated under the terms of its One Liberty Plaza lease to pay $106.9 million over the remaining life of the lease and recorded an estimated loss on the sublease of $21.5 million,
which was included in Other expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Nasdaq
signed a lease commencing May 1, 2002 at 1500 Broadway, directly across from the MarketSite building and began marketing the space at its One Liberty Plaza location. Due to
the softening of the real estate market in lower Manhattan, Nasdaq reconsidered its decision to relocate to 1500 Broadway and decided to support the downtown Manhattan community and maintain its
headquarters at One Liberty Plaza. As a result of the decision to remain at One Liberty Plaza, Nasdaq reevaluated the loss recorded in 2001 for One Liberty Plaza as well as its original plans to move
to 1500 Broadway. As of December 31, 2002, Nasdaq was obligated under the terms of its 1500 Broadway

F-16

lease to pay $84.5 million over the life of the lease. At December 31, 2002, the estimated loss on the sublease (including interest accretion) is approximately $23.2 million
including leasehold improvements. The estimated loss was calculated using an 8% net discount rate and an estimated 22-year sublease term commencing December 2003 at estimated market
rates. Nasdaq will continue to evaluate its estimated loss on 1500 Broadway.

In
addition, it was necessary for Nasdaq to make certain non-budgeted expenditures relating to September 11, 2001, including, but not limited to, costs related to the
efforts to restore services to market participants, the testing of trading systems and required reconfiguring of technology, telecommunications and alternative office facilities due to the temporary
relocation of employees. These other third and fourth quarter 2001 expenses of $1.7 million were included in Other expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. To date, Nasdaq has
received $0.4 million of insurance reimbursement relating to the above claim and is included in Other revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

During
the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, debt and marketable equity available-for-sale securities with a fair value at the date of sale of
$222.5 million and $396.6 million, respectively, were sold. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the gross realized gains on such sales
totaled $3.0 million $1.8 million and $2.8 million, respectively and the gross realized losses totaled $2.9 million, $4.2 million and $1.0 million,
respectively. The net adjustment after tax to unrealized holding gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities included as a separate component of stockholders' equity
totaled ($1.1) million, ($1.2) million and ($0.2) million for 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively. The net adjustment to unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities
included as a separate component of stockholders' equity due to the sale of securities totaled ($0.9) million, $2.1 million and ($1.2) million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

In
accordance with SFAS 115, Nasdaq recognized a pre-tax charge of $1.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 attributable to the impairment of certain
publicly-traded equity securities. The

F-18

impairment charge was related to the decline in the fair value of Nasdaq's publicly-traded equity investments below their cost basis that was judged to be
other-than-temporary. Nasdaq recorded the impairment loss in the Consolidated Statements of Income and adjusted the cost basis of respective securities down to fair value as a
new cost basis.

At
December 31, 2002 and 2001, investments with a carrying value of approximately $28.4 million and $28.6 million were pledged as collateral for Nasdaq's
$25.0 million note payable. (See Note 10, Senior Notes and Credit Facility, for further information.)

In
connection with the OptiMark, Inc. ("OptiMark") partnership, OptiMark issued warrants to Nasdaq to purchase up to an aggregate of 11.25 million shares of its common
stock, $.01 par value per share, which expire in 2004. The warrants are exercisable in several tranches upon the achievement of certain milestones, which are based primarily upon the average daily
share volume of Nasdaq-listed securities traded through the OptiMark Trading System.

In
September 2000, OptiMark announced a strategic change in its business that will allow it to focus on providing technology solutions to electronic marketplaces. As part of the
change, OptiMark decided to suspend trading operations on the OptiMark Trading System. As a result, Nasdaq management concluded that its investment in warrants in OptiMark as well as the realization
of the deferred revenue related to these warrants was impaired and reduced its investment in warrants and related deferred revenue to zero. As of December 31, 2002, Nasdaq still considered the
investment in warrants and the related deferred revenue impaired.

7.    Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

At December 31, 2002 and 2001, Nasdaq had goodwill of $10.1 million related to its acquisitions of Nasdaq Europe and Nasdaq Tools.

Intangible
assets with a definite life continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. At December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, Nasdaq has intangible assets
of $6.5 million and $9.3 million (net of accumulated amortization of $7.2 million and $4.6 million), respectively. Nasdaq estimates amortization expense of
$2.7 million in both 2003 and 2004 and $0.6 million in 2005.

Through
December 31, 2001, goodwill was amortized over periods of five to 10 years on a straight-line basis. The following table presents the impact of

8.    Joint Ventures and Equity Method Investments

NQLX

On June 1, 2001, Nasdaq and LIFFE formed NQLX, a U.S. joint venture company to list and trade single stock futures. Nasdaq has committed up to
$25.0 million plus the rights to use certain of its trademarks in this venture. Nasdaq made $2.0 million of capital contributions to the NQLX joint venture in 2001. During 2002, Nasdaq
made additional contributions to NQLX of $16.0 million. An additional $7.0 million is expected to be contributed in 2003, which will fulfill Nasdaq's Board's initial approval of
$25.0 million. On August 21, 2001, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved NQLX as a futures market and self-regulatory organization and on November 8, 2002
NQLX was launched. Through the end of 2002, NQLX operated under a fee holiday during which NQLX had no revenue. This fee holiday ended on March 31, 2003. Nasdaq accounts for its investment in
NQLX under the equity method of accounting. In 2002 and 2001, Nasdaq recorded losses of approximately $9.0 million and $6.0 million, respectively representing its share of the losses
incurred by NQLX. These losses are included in Other expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Nasdaq Japan

In 1999, the NASD contributed approximately $2.6 million for its initial 50.0% interest in Nasdaq Japan. After granting a restricted stock award of 4.0% of
its shares, the NASD transferred its remaining 46.0% interest to Nasdaq Global. In October 2000, Nasdaq Japan sold an approximate 15.0% stake for approximately $48.0 million to a group
of 13 major Japanese, U.S. and European brokerages, thereby reducing Nasdaq Global's interest from 46.0% to approximately 39.2%. As a result of the private placement, Nasdaq increased the carrying
value of its investment by approximately $7.8 million, recorded through stockholders equity, to reflect its adjusted share of the book value of Nasdaq Japan. In 2001, Nasdaq invested an
additional $7.4 million in Nasdaq Japan, increasing its ownership to 39.7%.

During
the second quarter of 2002, Nasdaq recognized an other-than-temporary impairment of its investment in Nasdaq Japan. Nasdaq recognized this impairment as a
result of the depressed level of market activity in Japan, combined with the suspension of Nasdaq Japan's hybrid trading system due to the inability to gain exchange approval of market rules and
industry participation. These conditions led management to conclude that Nasdaq Japan would not be profitable in the foreseeable future.

F-20

On
August 16, 2002, the Board of Directors of Nasdaq Japan voted to take the company to dormant status, effectively ceasing operations. Shareholders of Nasdaq Japan subsequently
ratified this decision. After careful consideration of a range of options, Nasdaq Japan's Board concluded that under current economic circumstances there was not a profitable path forward for the
company. A letter was sent to the Osaka Securities Exchange formally giving notice of termination of the Business Cooperation Agreement between the Osaka Exchange and Nasdaq Japan. Nasdaq Japan is
currently in liquidation status and is expected to be completely dissolved in the second quarter of 2003. Companies listed on the Nasdaq Japan Market retained their listing on the Osaka Exchange and
experienced no disruption to trading.

The
net impact of the other-than-temporary impairment on Nasdaq's pre-tax income for 2002 was $15.2 million. This represented a complete
write-down of the investment, outstanding and unfunded loans (an additional $6.0 million was loaned and $7.0 million was committed during 2002), foreign exchange translation
losses and other receivables, partially offset by a re-valuation of certain variable Nasdaq Japan stock based awards of approximately $7.9 million.

Prior
to the impairment loss recognized on its investment in Nasdaq Japan, Nasdaq accounted for its investment in Nasdaq Japan under the equity method of accounting. Including the
impairment of $15.2 million Nasdaq recorded losses of $18.3 million in 2002 and $11.3 million in 2001. No additional losses are expected to be recorded regarding Nasdaq Japan.

9.    Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Nasdaq considers cash and cash equivalents, receivables, receivables from related parties, investments, accounts payable and accrued expenses, accrued personnel
costs and senior notes and subordinated notes to be its financial instruments. The carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and cash equivalents, receivables, receivables
from related parties, investments, accounts payable and accrued expenses and accrued personnel costs closely approximates their fair values due to the short-term nature of these assets and
liabilities. The approximate fair value of Nasdaq's senior notes, subordinated notes and obligations under capital leases was estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based on Nasdaq's assumed
incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. This analysis indicates that the fair value of these obligations at December 31, 2002 and 2001 approximates their
carrying amounts.

F-21

10.  Senior Notes and Credit Facility

On May 9, 2002, Nasdaq issued $150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.83% senior notes due 2007 (the "Senior Notes") in a private
placement. The Senior Notes are unsecured, pay interest quarterly and may be redeemed by Nasdaq at any time, subject to a make-whole amount. The make-whole amount is equal to
the excess of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments discounted at a factor equal to 50 basis points over the yield to maturity of U.S. Treasury securities having a maturity equal to
the remaining average life of the redeemed amount. The proceeds from the Senior Notes, approximately $149.0 million after payment of placement agent commissions and expenses of this offering,
were used to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid to the NASD in the Repurchase and for general corporate purposes. Interest expense under the agreement totaled approximately
$5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.

On
August 29, 2002, Nasdaq entered into a $150.0 million unsecured revolving-credit facility as amended, (the "Facility"). The Facility, which is syndicated to five banks,
makes $150.0 million available to Nasdaq for a 364-day term. Nasdaq intends to use the Facility for general corporate purposes. The interest rate
applicable to borrowings under the Facility (a) for U.S. based loans will be based on the higher of Citibank N.A.'s base rate and 0.5 percent per annum above the then current Federal
Funds rate and (b) for LIBOR loans will be based on the offered rate for deposits in the U.S. dollars with a comparable maturity plus 0.36 percent per annum. The Facility provides for an
annual fee of 0.09% of the $150.0 million Facility. The Facility, as amended, has various covenants customary for this type of facility that require Nasdaq, among other things, to maintain
various financial ratios such as consolidated long-term debt to capitalization, minimum tangible net worth and consolidated earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and
amortization to consolidated interest expense. Noncompliance with the terms of the Facility by Nasdaq could result in the cancellation of the Facility with any amounts outstanding under the Facility
becoming payable immediately. At December 31, 2002, Nasdaq had not utilized the Facility, and the entire $150.0 million of the Facility was available.

In
May 1997, Nasdaq entered into a $25.0 million note payable with a financial institution (the "Lender"). Principal payments are scheduled to begin in 2007 and continue in
equal monthly installments until maturity in 2012. The note requires monthly interest payments through May 2007 at an annual rate of 7.41%. After May 2007, Nasdaq will incur interest
equal to the Lender's cost of funds rate, as defined in the agreement, plus 0.5%. Interest expensed and paid under the agreement totaled approximately $1.9 million for each of the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000.

Nasdaq
Europe has $26.0 million and $23.5 million of notes payable outstanding with third parties as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These notes are
denominated in Euros, and $11.3 million matures in 2003 and the remaining notes mature in 2004 or within five days of default of any loan covenant. Nasdaq Europe incurs interest expense at a
rate of 6.0% on approximately $4.3 million of the notes and London Inter-Bank Offered Rate plus 1% on the remaining $21.7 million of the notes. Interest expensed and accrued
totaled approximately $1.1 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Nasdaq
Europe also has $21.7 million of intercompany loans with Nasdaq outstanding as of December 31, 2002. Nasdaq funded these loans to finance the operations of Nasdaq
Europe and to enable Nasdaq Europe to invest in Nasdaq Deutschland AG, a venture among Nasdaq Europe, several German banks and two regional German exchanges (See Note 17, Commitments and
Contingencies, for further discussion). Nasdaq has agreed to convert the intercompany loans from debt to equity if the majority of the European strategic partners also convert their debt to equity. In
October 2002, Nasdaq Europe's strategic investors committed to convert approximately $18.6 million or 73.8% of Nasdaq Europe's external debt to equity ($44.5 million or 87.1%
including intercompany debt with Nasdaq). The conversion was formally approved by Nasdaq Europe's Board in March 2003 and is expected to close in May 2003.

F-22

11.  Subordinated Notes

On May 3, 2001, Nasdaq sold the Subordinated Notes to Hellman & Friedman. Until Nasdaq becomes registered with the SEC as a national securities
exchange ("Exchange Registration"), Hellman & Friedman may only exercise its conversion rights for a number of shares of Common Stock such that immediately following such conversion, the NASD
will continue to control greater than 50% of the combined voting power of Nasdaq. Nasdaq used the proceeds from the sale of the Subordinated Notes to purchase 18,461,538 shares of Common Stock from
the NASD for $13.00 per share. The annual 4.0% coupon will be payable in arrears and the Subordinated Notes are convertible at any time into an aggregate of 12.0 million shares of Common Stock
at $20.00 per share, subject to adjustment, in general, for any stock split, dividend, combination, recapitalization or other similar event.

In
2002, Nasdaq stockholders approved an amendment to Nasdaq's Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate of Incorporation") that provided for voting debt. As a result, the
holders of the Subordinated Notes may vote on an as-converted basis on all matters on which holders of common stock have the right to vote, subject to the current 5.0% voting limitation in
the Certificate of Incorporation. Nasdaq has granted Hellman & Friedman certain registration rights with respect to the shares of Common Stock underlying the Subordinated Notes.

On
an as-converted basis, Hellman & Friedman owned an approximate 13.9% equity interest as a result of these Subordinated Notes in Nasdaq as well as 500,000 shares
owned of Common Stock as of December 31, 2002. Hellman & Friedman is permitted to designate one person reasonably acceptable to Nasdaq for nomination as a director of Nasdaq for so long
as Hellman & Friedman owns Subordinated Notes and/or shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion thereof representing at least 50.0% of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
the Subordinated Notes initially purchased. F. Warren Hellman, chairman of Hellman & Friedman, serves as a director of Nasdaq pursuant to this agreement.

As
of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, deferred tax assets consisted primarily of book and tax differences related to deferred fees of $72.6 million and
$78.3 million, foreign net operating losses of $33.3 million and $31.3 million, technology costs of $9.6 million and $11.8 million, and bad debts of
$9.6 million and $5.9 million.

As
of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, deferred tax liabilities consisted primarily of book and tax differences related to software development costs of
$35.9 million and $29.0 million, and depreciation of $10.8 million and $10.6 million.

The
increase in the valuation allowance is due to an increase in foreign net operating losses. Of the $33.3 million foreign net operating losses at December 31, 2002,
$11.0 million will expire 2007 through 2009 and $22.3 million have no expiration date. In addition, on December 31, 2002 and 2001, Nasdaq has a deferred tax asset related to a
deferred capital loss carryforward of $6.1 million.

13.  Employee Benefits

Nasdaq is a participating employer in a noncontributory, defined-benefit pension plan that the NASD sponsors for the benefit of its eligible employees and the
eligible employees of its subsidiaries. The benefits are primarily based on years of service and the employees' average salary during the highest 60 consecutive months of employment. The plan assets
consist primarily of fixed income and equity securities.

In
addition, Nasdaq participates in a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") that is maintained by the NASD for certain senior executives.

During
2002, there was a settlement of $1.2 million for employees included within the SERP plan due to early retirements. During 2001, there was a curtailment gain recognized of
$1.3 million in the pension plan to reflect the reduction in force on June 26, 2001.

Pursuant
to the provisions of SFAS No. 87 "Employer's Accounting for Pensions," related to the SERP, an intangible asset of $1.0 million and an adjustment to stockholders'
equity of $1.4 million (net of tax of $0.9 million), were recorded as of December 31, 2001 to recognize the minimum pension liability. As of December 31, 2002, both the
intangible asset and the adjustment to stockholders' equity were reduced to $0.6 million and $1.1 million (net of tax of $0.7 million), respectively.

Prior
to April 1, 2002, Nasdaq participated in a voluntary savings plan for eligible employees of the NASD and its subsidiaries. As of April 1, 2002, in accordance with the
Restructuring, Nasdaq formed its own voluntary savings plan and all amounts were transferred to this new plan. Employees are immediately eligible to make contributions to the plan and are also
eligible for an employer contribution match at an amount equal to 100% of the first 4% of eligible employee contributions. Eligible plan participants may also receive an additional discretionary match
from Nasdaq. Savings plan expense for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, was $1.8 million, $5.9 million and $3.7 million, respectively. The expense includes
a discretionary match authorized by the Nasdaq Board of Directors totaling $0.75 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 and $1.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000. There was no discretionary match for 2002.

14.  Stock Compensation and Stock Awards

Effective December 5, 2000, as amended on January 23, 2002, Nasdaq adopted The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan"),
under which nonqualified and qualified incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, or other stock based awards may be granted to employees, directors, officers and consultants.
A total of 24,500,000 shares are authorized under the Plan. At December 31, 2002, 12,967,435 shares were available for future grants under the Plan.

In
2002, Nasdaq granted 2,155,279 stock options and 76,950 shares of restricted stock to employees and officers and 65,000 options to non-employee Board of Directors members
pursuant to the Plan. During 2002, 919,851 stock options and 48,570 shares of restricted stock awards were forfeited.

Restricted
stock awards are awarded in the name of the employee or officer at fair value on the date of the grant. The awards contain restrictions on sales and transfers, are generally
subject to a five-year vesting period and are expensed over the vesting period. Nasdaq recognized $2.0 million and $4.1 million in amortization expense related to restricted
stock during the years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively.

Stock
options are granted with an exercise price equal to the estimated fair market value of the stock on the date of the grant. Nasdaq accounts for stock option grants in accordance
with APB 25, and, accordingly, recognizes no compensation expense related to such grants.

F-26

Options
granted generally vest over three years and expire 10 years from the date of grant. All options to date have been granted at fair market value on the date of grant. At
December 31, 2002, options for 5,292,654 shares were vested, and exercisable with a weighted-average exercise price of $12.77. At December 31, 2001, options for 3,597,430 shares were
vested, and exercisable with a weighted-average exercise price of $12.73.

Nasdaq
has an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees. Under the plan, shares of Common Stock may be purchased at six-month intervals (each, an "Offering
Period") at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each Offering Period. Employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 10% of their annual compensation,
subject to applicable annual Internal Revenue Service limitations. During 2002 and 2001, employees purchased an aggregate of 210,046 and 326,580 shares at a weighted-average price of $10.22 and $10.63
per share, respectively.

Pro
forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required under SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123") and has been
determined as if Nasdaq had
accounted for all stock option grants based on the fair value method. The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model assuming a
weighted-average expected life of five years, weighted-average expected volatility of 30% and a weighted-average risk free interest rate of 4.31% and 4.68% for 2002 and 2001, respectively. The
weighted-average fair value of options granted in 2002 and 2001 was $4.69 and $4.55, respectively.

Pro
forma net income includes the amortization of the fair value of stock options over the vesting period and the difference between the fair value and the purchase price of common
shares purchased by employees under the employee stock purchase plan. The pro forma information for the years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001 is as follows:

In
May and July 2000, restricted Common Stock and options on Common Stock of Nasdaq Japan were awarded to certain Nasdaq officers and key employees who devote substantial time to
the operations of Nasdaq Japan. These awards contained restrictions and were subject to vesting provisions,

F-27

generally three years. The options were granted at an exercise price of $125 per share, the estimated fair market value of the common stock at the time of the award. The options were exercisable for
a period of seven years. As of December 31, 2001 there were 784 stock options outstanding to purchase shares of Nasdaq Japan held by Nasdaq Global, 261 of them exercisable with an approximate
value of $6,175 per share. The restricted Common Stock award was for 1,900 shares at the estimated fair value of $125 per share. Approximately one-third of the shares vested immediately
while the remaining two-thirds were to vest over a two-year period. As of December 31, 2001, the restricted Common Stock
had an approximate value of $6,250 per share. All share and dollar amounts reflect a four-for-one stock split of Nasdaq Japan shares in April 2001.

The
options and restricted Common Stock awards were marked to market, and the fair value was being expensed over the vesting periods. Nasdaq recorded approximately $2.8 million
and $3.8 million in compensation expense related to these awards in 2001 and 2000, respectively. During the second quarter of 2002, Nasdaq recognized a $15.2 million
other-than-temporary impairment of its investment in Nasdaq Japan. Included in this impairment charge was a benefit for the revaluation of the stock based awards of
approximately $7.9 million. As of December 31, 2002, the options outstanding have no value and effectively were cancelled. On August 16, 2002 the Board of Directors of Nasdaq
Japan voted to take the company to dormant status, effectively ceasing operations. Nasdaq Japan is currently in liquidation status and is expected to be completely dissolved in the second quarter of
2003. (See Note 2, Significant Transactions, for further discussion.)

15.  Leases

Nasdaq leases certain office space and equipment in connection with its operations. The majority of these leases contain escalation clauses based on increases in
property taxes and building operating costs. Certain of these leases also contain renewal options. Rent expense for operating leases was $14.0 million, $11.0 million and
$9.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Future
minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more, (including the lease obligation at 1500 Broadway of
$84.5 million, See Note 5, Real Estate Developments, for further discussion) consisted of the following at December 31, 2002:

17.  Commitments and Contingencies

As of December 31, 2002, €21.3 million ($22.3 million) was funded in the form of a loan from a commitment of
€31.8 million ($33.4 million) for Nasdaq Europe. Of the funded amount, €15.5 million ($16.2 million) was used to finance the operations of
Nasdaq Europe through 2002. The remaining €5.8 million ($6.1 million) was used to enable Nasdaq Europe to invest in Nasdaq Deutschland AG, a venture among Nasdaq Europe,
several German banks and two regional German exchanges. Nasdaq has agreed to convert the aggregate amount of outstanding loans from debt to equity if the majority of

F-29

the European strategic partners also convert their debt to equity. In October 2002, Nasdaq Europe's strategic investors committed to convert 73.8% of Nasdaq Europe's external debt to equity
(or 87.1% including intercompany debt with Nasdaq). The conversion was formally approved by Nasdaq Europe's Board in March 2003 and is expected to close in May 2003. An additional
€10.5 million ($11.1 million) is expected to be contributed in 2003 for Nasdaq Europe operations, which will fulfill Nasdaq's Boards funding approval of
€31.8 million ($33.4 million).

Nasdaq
has agreed to guarantee the provision of certain support and maintenance services for the trading platform to be operated by Nasdaq Deutschland AG in the event Nasdaq Europe no
longer provides such services due to circumstances including its liquidation or winding down. Nasdaq's obligation to provide services would continue for a period of 18 months from the date the
guarantee is triggered, but in no event longer than three years from the date trading begins on the Nasdaq Deutschland exchange. Nasdaq will be obligated to perform under the guarantee only if Nasdaq
Deutschland satisfies certain conditions, including minimum quarterly order flow requirements for periods starting in the fourth quarter of 2003. Nasdaq estimates the maximum cost of providing the
services at €14.7 million ($15.4 million) over the term of the guarantee.

In
December 2002, Nasdaq purchased the NASD's 50.0% interest in the NASD Insurance Agency (subsequently renamed the Nasdaq Insurance Agency, LLC ("NIA")). Nasdaq's consideration
for the NASD's 50.0% interest consisted of an upfront payment of $0.5 million and up to $5.1 million based on NIA's stream of contingent cash flow through 2011. Nasdaq will pay
(a) 20% of NIA's cash flows until Nasdaq has paid the NASD $2.3 million from cash flows; (b) 10% of NIA's cash flows until Nasdaq has paid the NASD a cumulative amount of
$3.0 million from cash flows; (c) 5% of NIA's cash flows until Nasdaq has paid the NASD the full cumulative amount of $5.1 million from cash flows.

During
2001, Nasdaq agreed to fund a portion of the necessary expenses related to the separation of software, hardware and data under a plan to transition technology applications and
support from Nasdaq to Amex. The NASD originally integrated certain Nasdaq and Amex technology subsequent to the 1998 acquisition of Amex by the NASD. The total estimated cost of the separation had
been established at a maximum of $29.0 million, and was to be shared evenly between Nasdaq and the NASD. In 2002 and 2001, Nasdaq accrued $5.3 million and $9.2 million,
respectively under this commitment fulfilling its commitment. As of December 31, 2002, $3.7 million has been paid to Amex.

The
Board of Directors of Nasdaq have approved a capital contribution of up to $25.0 million to the NQLX joint venture. Nasdaq made a $2.0 million capital contribution in
2001. During 2002, Nasdaq made additional contributions to NQLX of $16.0 million. An additional $7.0 million is expected to be contributed in 2003, which will fulfill Nasdaq's Board's
initial approval of $25.0 million.

Nasdaq
entered into a six-year $600.0 million contract with WorldCom in 1997 to replace the data network that connected the Nasdaq market facilities to market
participants. As part of that contract, Nasdaq provided a guaranteed revenue commitment to WorldCom of $300.0 million. Nasdaq was permitted to renegotiate the contract once the minimum
guarantee was satisfied. In June 2002, an amendment to the original contract was negotiated with WorldCom once the minimum usage level of $300.0 million was achieved from the original
contract. The amended contract supersedes the terms of the existing contract and is for $182.0 million over three years commencing in June 2002. The three-year contract
includes fixed and variable cost components for two years and permits Nasdaq to terminate
the contract in certain circumstances after the second year. Although WorldCom declared bankruptcy in July 2002, Nasdaq does not foresee any interruption in service under the contract.

Nasdaq
may be subject to claims arising out of the conduct of its business. Currently, there are certain legal proceedings pending against Nasdaq. Nasdaq believes, based upon the opinion
of counsel, that any liabilities or settlements arising from these proceedings will not have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of Nasdaq. Management is not aware of
any unasserted

F-30

claims or assessments that would have a material adverse effect on the financial position and the results of operations of Nasdaq.

18.  Related Party Transactions

Related party receivables and payables are the result of various transactions between Nasdaq and its affiliates. Payables to related parties are comprised
primarily of the regulation charge from NASDR, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the NASD. NASDR charges Nasdaq for costs incurred related to Nasdaq market regulation and enforcement. Support charges from
the NASD to Nasdaq represent another significant component of payables to related parties. The support charges include an allocation of a portion of the NASD's administrative expenses as well as its
costs incurred to develop and maintain technology on behalf of Nasdaq. The remaining component of payables to related parties is cash disbursements funded by the NASD on behalf of Nasdaq.

Receivables
from related parties are primarily attributable to costs incurred by Amex and funded by Nasdaq related to various Amex technology projects. The remaining portion of the
receivable from related parties balance is related to cash disbursements funded by Nasdaq on behalf of its affiliates. Disbursements made by Nasdaq on behalf of affiliates relate mainly to office
supply and utility charges where Nasdaq represents the largest portion.

Surveillance Charge from NASDR

NASDR incurs costs associated with surveillance monitoring, legal and enforcement activities related to the regulation of The Nasdaq Stock Market. These costs are
charged to Nasdaq based upon the NASD management's estimated percentage of costs incurred by each NASDR department that are attributable directly to The Nasdaq Stock Market surveillance. The following
table represents Nasdaq management's estimate of the composition of costs charged by NASDR to Nasdaq:

On
June 28, 2000, Nasdaq and NASDR signed a Regulatory Services Agreement pursuant to which NASDR or its subsidiaries would provide regulatory services to Nasdaq and its
subsidiaries commencing upon the effectiveness of Exchange Registration. As a result, no services have been performed under this agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Regulatory Services Agreement,
the services provided will be of the same type and scope as are currently provided by NASDR to Nasdaq under the Delegation Plan for a term of ten years. Each regulatory service is to be provided for a
minimum of five years, after which time the parties may determine to terminate the provision by NASDR of a particular service. The termination of a particular service will generally be based upon a
review of pricing and the need for such services. In 2002, Nasdaq paid NASDR $76.7 million for regulatory services provided pursuant to the Delegation Plan.

F-31

Support Charge from the NASD

The NASD provides various administrative services to Nasdaq including legal assistance, accounting and managerial services. It is the NASD's policy to charge
these expenses and other operating costs to Nasdaq based upon usage percentages determined by management of the NASD and Nasdaq. Additionally, the NASD incurs certain costs related to the development
and maintenance of technology for Nasdaq. Technology development costs are allocated directly to Nasdaq based upon specific projects requested by Nasdaq. Technology maintenance costs are allocated
based upon Nasdaq's share of computer usage. The following table represents Nasdaq management's estimate of the composition of costs charged by the NASD to Nasdaq:

The
NASD and Nasdaq entered into a Separation and Common Services Agreement, dated as of January 1, 2002 (the "New Separation Agreement"), which replaced an interim Separation and
Common Services Agreement executed in 2000 (the "Interim Agreement"). The services to be provided to Nasdaq by the NASD under the New Separation Agreement are limited to certain finance, technology
infrastructure, facilities sharing and legal services, which is substantially more limited than what were previously provided by the NASD under the Interim Agreement. Under the New Separation
Agreement, Nasdaq pays to the NASD the costs of the services provided, including any incidental expenses associated with such services. Nasdaq anticipates that the annual costs for services under the
New Separation Agreement will drop in future years as Nasdaq reviews the provision of these services and continues to internalize more of these services or seeks alternative third party providers.

Nasdaq Charge to Amex

Nasdaq incurs technology costs on behalf of Amex related to development of new Amex systems and enhancement of existing Amex systems. Amounts are charged based
upon specific projects requested by Amex. Amounts charged from Nasdaq to Amex are included in support costs from related parties and are summarized as follows:

Nasdaq
has agreed to fund a portion of the necessary expenses related to the separation of software, hardware and data under a plan to transition technology applications and support from
Nasdaq to Amex. The NASD originally integrated Nasdaq and Amex technology subsequent to the 1998 acquisition of Amex by the NASD. The total estimated cost of the separation had been established at a
maximum of $29.0 million and was to be shared evenly between Nasdaq and the NASD. In the opinion of management, all methods of cost allocation described above are reasonable for the services
rendered. (See Note 17, Commitment and Contingencies, for further information.)

19.  Capital Stock

At December 31, 2002, 300,000,000 shares of Nasdaq's Common Stock were authorized, 130,518,921 shares were issued and 78,266,708 shares were outstanding.
Each share of Common Stock has one vote, except that any person, other than the NASD or any other person as may be approved for such
exemption by the Nasdaq Board of Directors prior to the time such person owns more than 5% of the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock, who would otherwise be entitled to exercise
voting rights in respect of more than 5% of the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock will be unable to exercise voting rights for any shares in excess of 5% of the
then-outstanding shares of Common Stock. In connection with the Restructuring, the NASD sold approximately 10,806,494 warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 43,225,976 outstanding
shares of Common Stock owned by the NASD. The voting rights associated with the shares of Common Stock underlying the warrants, as well as the shares of Common Stock purchased through the valid
exercise of warrants, are governed by the voting trust agreement (the "Voting Trust Agreement") entered into by the NASD, Nasdaq and The Bank of New York, as voting trustee (the "Voting Trustee").
Initially, the holders of the warrants (each, a "Warrant Holder" and, collectively, the "Warrant Holders") will not have any voting rights with respect to the shares of Common Stock underlying such
warrants. Until Exchange Registration the shares of Common Stock underlying unexercised and unexpired warrant tranches, as well as the shares of Common Stock purchased through the exercise of
warrants, will be voted by the Voting Trustee at the direction of the NASD. The voting rights associated with the shares of Common Stock underlying unexercised and expired warrant tranches will revert
to the NASD. However, the NASD has determined, commencing upon Exchange Registration, to vote any shares of Common Stock that it owns (other than shares underlying then outstanding warrants) in the
same proportion as the other stockholders of Nasdaq. Upon Exchange Registration, the Warrant Holders will have the right to direct the Voting Trustee as to the voting of the shares of Common Stock
underlying unexercised and unexpired warrant tranches until the earlier of the exercise or the expiration of such warrant tranches. The shares of Common Stock purchased upon a valid exercise of a
warrant tranche prior to Exchange Registration will be released from the Voting Trust Agreement upon Exchange Registration. The shares of Common Stock purchased upon a valid exercise of a warrant
tranche after Exchange Registration will not be subject to the Voting Trust Agreement.

On
March 8, 2002, Nasdaq completed the Repurchase of 33,768,895 shares of Nasdaq's Common Stock owned by the NASD, which represented all of the remaining outstanding shares of
Common Stock owned by the NASD, except for the 43,225,976 shares of Common Stock underlying the warrants. Nasdaq purchased the Common Stock for approximately $305.2 million in aggregate cash
consideration, 1,338,402 shares of Nasdaq's Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock (face and liquidation value of $100 per share, plus any accumulated unpaid dividends), and one share of Nasdaq's
Series B Preferred Stock, (face and liquidation value of $1.00 per share). The NASD owns all of the outstanding shares of Series A and Series B Preferred Stock. All of the shares
of Common Stock repurchased by Nasdaq from the NASD have been placed into Common Stock in treasury. As of December 31, 2002, there were 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized,
1,338,402 and 1 share of Series A and Series B, respectively issued and outstanding.

Dividends
payable to the NASD on the Series A Preferred Stock began accruing in March 2003. The Series A Preferred Stock carries a 7.6% dividend rate for the year
commencing March 2003 and

F-33

10.6% in all years commencing after March 2003, payable at the discretion of Nasdaq's Board of Directors. Shares of Series A Preferred Stock do not have voting rights, except for the
right as a class to elect two new directors to the Board of Directors anytime distributions on the Series A Preferred Stock are in arrears for four consecutive quarters and as otherwise
required by Delaware law. Nasdaq may redeem the shares of Series A Preferred Stock at any time after Exchange Registration and is required to use the net proceeds from an initial public
offering ("IPO"), and upon the occurrence of certain other events, to redeem all or a portion of the Series A Preferred Stock. The Series B Preferred Stock
does not pay dividends. The NASD, as holder of the one share of the Series B Preferred Stock, will be entitled to cast the number of votes that, together with all other votes that the NASD is
entitled to vote by virtue of ownership, proxies or voting trusts, enables the NASD to cast one vote more than one-half of all votes entitled to be cast by stockholders of Nasdaq. If
Nasdaq obtains Exchange Registration, the share of Series B Preferred Stock will automatically lose its voting rights and will be redeemed by Nasdaq. In addition to the voting rights of the
Common Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, the holders of the Subordinated Notes have certain voting rights as discussed in Note 11, Subordinated Notes.

On
July 1, 2002, the Common Stock of Nasdaq began trading under the symbol "NDAQ" on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. The limited trading of the
security began upon the expiration of the contractual transfer restrictions imposed in connection with the sale of Common Stock by Nasdaq and the NASD in Phase I and Phase II of the Restructuring that
occurred in June 2000 and January 2001, respectively.

In
connection with the repurchase of ownership interest of a shareholder in Nasdaq Europe Planning in 2001, Nasdaq issued a warrant to purchase up to an aggregate of 479,648 shares of
Common Stock. The warrant is exercisable in four annual tranches ranging from $13.00 to $16.00 per share beginning June 28, 2002. The issuance of the warrants has been recorded at fair value in
stockholders' equity. As of December 31, 2002 the warrant is still outstanding and no tranches have been exercised.

On
November 12, 2001, Nasdaq sold an aggregate amount of 535,000 shares of Common Stock to five members of the Nasdaq Board of Directors and 500,000 shares of Common Stock to
Hellman & Friedman for an aggregate offering price of $10,608,750. The shares were sold in a private transaction at the current fair market value, pursuant to an exemption from registration
contained in section 4(2) of the Securities Act.

In
December 2001, the Board adopted a revised Non-Employee Directors Compensation Policy whereby beginning in 2002 all non-employee directors will be
awarded 5,000 stock options per year with an exercise price at fair market value, which may be exercised for up to 10 years while serving on the Board of Directors (in general, three years from
termination of service on the Board of Directors). On January 23, 2002, 65,000 stock options were awarded to all non-employee directors pursuant to the plan.

20.  Earnings Per Common Share

Earnings per common share is computed in accordance with SFAS No. 128, "Earnings Per Share" ("SFAS 128"). Basic earnings per share excludes the
dilutive effects of options, warrants and convertible securities, and is calculated by dividing net income available to common stock holders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects all potentially dilutive securities.

Options
to purchase 10,917,403 shares of Common Stock, 12,000,000 shares underlying Subordinated Notes and 479,648 shares underlying warrants were outstanding during
2002. For the year ending December 31, 2002, 10,709,423 of the options outstanding and 119,912 of the shares underlying the warrants were included in the computation of diluted earnings per
share, on a weighted average basis, as their inclusion was dilutive. The remaining options, remaining shares underlying the warrants issued by Nasdaq and the 12,000,000 shares underlying Subordinated
Notes outstanding during 2002, were considered antidilutive and were properly excluded.

Options
to purchase 8,569,258 shares of Common Stock, 12,000,000 shares underlying Subordinated Notes and 479,648 shares underlying warrants were outstanding during 2001, but were not
included in the computation of earnings per share as their inclusion would be antidilutive. During 2000 there were no potentially dilutive common shares outstanding.

21.  Subsequent Event

Nasdaq Deutschland

The recapitalization of Bremer Wertpapierbörse AG, a German stock exchange, rebranded as "Nasdaq Deutschland AG" and marketed under the Nasdaq
brand, was finalized on January 21, 2003. This exchange, which will be subject to the German public law entity resulting from the merger of the Bremen Stock Exchange and the Berlin Stock
Exchange, will initially be majority-owned by Nasdaq Europe. Trading in German and international blue chip and growth stocks began on March 21, 2003.
