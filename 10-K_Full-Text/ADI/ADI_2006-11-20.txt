ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Company
    Overview

We are a world leader in the design, manufacture and marketing
    of high-performance analog, mixed-signal and digital signal
    processing integrated circuits used in industrial,
    communication, computer and consumer applications. Since our
    inception in 1965, we have focused on solving the engineering
    challenges associated with signal processing in electronic
    equipment. Real world signal processing describes the process of
    converting real-world phenomena such as temperature, motion,
    pressure, light and sound into electrical signals to be used in
    a wide array of electronic equipment ranging from industrial
    process control, factory automation systems, defense
    electronics, portable wireless communications devices, cellular
    basestations, central office networking equipment, computers,
    automobiles, medical imaging equipment, digital cameras and
    digital televisions. Signal processing technology is a critical
    element of high-speed communications, digital entertainment, and
    other consumer, computer and industrial applications. As new
    generations of digital applications evolve, they generate new
    needs for high-performance analog signal processing and digital
    signal processing, or DSP, technology. We produce a wide range
    of products that are designed to meet the signal processing
    technology needs of a broad base of customers.

During our fiscal year ended October 28, 2006, or fiscal
    2006, approximately 42% of our revenue came from the industrial
    market, which includes factory automation, medical equipment,
    scientific instrumentation, automatic test equipment, automotive
    electronics, security equipment, and aerospace and defense
    systems.

Revenue from the communications market represented approximately
    29% of our fiscal 2006 revenue. Communications applications
    include wireless handsets and wireless basestations, as well as
    products used for high-speed access to the Internet, including
    broadband modems and central office networking equipment.

The demand for our products used in high-performance consumer
    electronics has been increasing and represented approximately
    17% of our revenue for fiscal 2006. Applications in this market
    include digital cameras and camcorders, flat-panel and plasma
    digital televisions, and surround sound audio systems.

We also serve the personal computer market with products that
    monitor and manage power usage, process signals used in flat
    panel displays and multimedia projectors, and enable
    high-quality audio. In fiscal 2006, the computer market
    accounted for approximately 12% of our revenue.

We sell our products worldwide through a direct sales force,
    third-party distributors and independent sales representatives.
    We have direct sales offices in 20 countries, including the
    United States.

We are headquartered near Boston, in Norwood, Massachusetts, and
    have manufacturing facilities in Massachusetts, North Carolina,
    Ireland and the Philippines. On November 9, 2006, we closed
    our Sunnyvale, California wafer fabrication facility and
    transferred virtually all of the production of products
    manufactured there to our facility in Wilmington, Massachusetts.
    We were founded in 1965 and are incorporated in Massachusetts.
    As of October 28, 2006, we employed approximately 9,800
    individuals worldwide. Our common stock is listed on the New
    York Stock Exchange under the symbol ADI and is included in the
    Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.

We maintain a website with the address www.analog.com. We are

Industry
    Background

All electronic signals fall into one of two categories, analog
    or digital. Analog, also known as linear, signals represent
    real-world phenomena, such as temperature, pressure, sound,
    speed and motion. This information can be detected and measured
    using analog sensors, which represent real-world phenomena by
    generating continuously-varying voltages and currents. The
    signals from these sensors are initially processed using analog
    methods, such as amplification, filtering and shaping. They are
    then usually converted to digital form for storage or further
    manipulation. The further manipulation of the signals after
    conversion to digital form is called “digital signal
    processing.” Digital signals represent the “ones”
    and “zeros” of binary arithmetic and are either on or
    off. Digital signals are frequently converted back to analog
    form for functions such as video display, audio output or
    control. These manipulations and transformations from analog to
    digital and back to analog are known as “real-world signal
    processing” within the signal chain.

Significant advances in semiconductor technology in recent years
    have substantially increased the performance and functionality
    of integrated circuits, or ICs, used in signal processing
    applications. These advances include the ability to combine
    analog and digital signal processing capability on a single
    chip, thereby making possible more highly-integrated solutions.
    The widespread application of low-cost, high-performance
    microprocessor-based systems and the ongoing transition to
    digital media for communications, music, photography, and video
    has increased the need for precise, high-speed signal
    conditioning interfaces between the analog world and digital
    electronics. At the same time, the convergence of computing and
    communications has resulted in end products that incorporate

state-of-the-art

signal processing capability onto as few chips as possible. Our
    products are designed to be used within electronic equipment to
    achieve higher performance, including greater speed, improved
    accuracy, more efficient signal processing and minimized power
    consumption.

Principal
    Products

We design, manufacture and market a broad line of
    high-performance ICs that incorporate analog, mixed-signal and
    digital signal processing technologies. Our ICs are designed to
    address a wide range of real-world signal processing
    applications. Across the entire range of our signal processing
    ICs are both general-purpose standard products used by a broad
    range of customers and applications as well as
    application-specific products designed for specific clusters of
    customers in key target markets. By using readily available,
    high-performance, general-purpose products in their systems, our
    customers can reduce the time they need to bring new products to
    market. Given the high cost of developing more customized ICs,
    our standard products often provide the most cost-effective
    solution for many low to medium volume applications. However, in
    some communications, computer and consumer products, we focus on
    working with leading customers to design application-specific
    solutions. We begin with our existing core technologies in
    analog and DSP, and devise a solution to more closely meet the
    needs of a specific customer or group of customers. Because we
    have already developed the core technology for our
    general-purpose products, we can create application-specific
    solutions quickly.

We produce and market several thousand products. Our ten highest
    revenue products, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately
    10% of our revenue for fiscal 2006. The majority of our products
    are proprietary, meaning equivalent products are not available
    from competitors. A limited number of other companies may
    provide products with similar functions.

Analog
    Products

Our analog IC technology has been the foundation of our business
    for four decades, and we believe we are one of the world’s
    largest suppliers of analog ICs. Our analog ICs are primarily
    high-performance devices, generally defined as devices that
    support a minimum of 10-bits of accuracy and a minimum of 50
    megahertz of speed. The principal advantages these products have
    versus competitors’ products include higher accuracy, lower
    cost per function, smaller size, lower power consumption and
    fewer components resulting in improved reliability. The majority
    of our analog IC product revenue is attributable to sales of
    data converters and amplifiers. The data converter and amplifier
    product categories represented approximately 61% of our fiscal
    2006 revenue. Over the past several years we have been expanding
    our analog IC product offerings along the entire analog signal
    chain and into



product areas such as radio frequency integrated circuits, or RF
    ICs, and power management products such as voltage regulators
    and thermal monitoring ICs, phase locked loops and high-speed
    clock ICs.

The majority of our analog IC products are proprietary to us in
    their design and our product portfolio addresses a wide range of
    applications. Our product portfolio includes several thousand
    analog ICs, any one of which can have as many as several hundred
    customers. Our analog ICs typically have long product life
    cycles. Our analog IC customers include both original equipment
    manufacturers, or OEMs, and customers who build electronic
    subsystems for integration into larger systems.

Our analog technology base also includes products using an
    advanced IC technology known in the industry as surface
    micromachining, which is used to produce semiconductor products
    known as micro-electromechanical systems, or MEMS. This
    technology enables extremely small mechanical sensing elements
    to be built on the surface of a chip along with supporting
    circuitry. In addition to incorporating an electro-mechanical
    structure, these devices also have analog circuitry for
    conditioning signals obtained from the sensing element. The
    integration of signal conditioning and MEMS is a unique feature
    of our products which we call
    iMEMS

®

.
    Our iMEMS product portfolio includes accelerometers used to
    sense acceleration, and gyroscopes used to sense position. The
    majority of our current revenue from MEMS products is derived
    from accelerometers used by automotive manufacturers in airbag
    applications. However, revenue from consumer and industrial
    customers is increasing as we develop products using this
    technology for applications in these end markets.

DSP
    Products

DSPs are processors that are optimized for high-speed numeric
    calculations, which are essential for instantaneous, or
    real-time, processing of digital data generated, in most cases,
    from analog to digital signal conversion. Our DSP products are
    designed to be fully programmable and to efficiently execute
    specialized software programs, or algorithms, associated with
    processing digitized real-time, real-world data. Programmable
    DSPs provide the flexibility to modify the device’s
    function quickly and inexpensively in software. We offer both
    general-purpose and application-specific DSP products.
    General-purpose DSP IC customers typically write their own
    algorithms using software development tools that we provide and
    software development tools they obtain from third-party
    suppliers. Our application-specific DSP products typically
    include analog and DSP technology and the DSPs are preprogrammed
    to execute software for applications such as wireless
    telecommunications or image processing. Our DSPs are designed in
    families of products that share a common architecture and
    therefore can execute the same software. We support these
    products with

easy-to-use,

low-cost development tools, which reduce our customers’
    product development costs and

time-to-market.

We also have the capability to combine our analog and digital
    signal processing technology into multi-function mixed-signal
    devices and chipsets. The growing technological demands
    associated with the use of audio and video in computers and
    consumer products as well as the networking of communications
    systems has created new opportunities for these mixed-signal
    products.

Markets
    and Applications

The following describes some of the characteristics of, and
    customer products within, our major markets:

Industrial

— Our industrial market
    includes the following areas:

Industrial Process Automation

— Our industrial
    process automation market includes applications such as factory
    automation systems, automatic process control systems, robotics,
    environmental control systems and automatic test equipment.
    These applications generally require ICs that offer performance
    greater than that available from commodity-level ICs, but
    generally do not have production volumes that warrant custom or
    application-specific ICs. Combinations of analog, mixed-signal
    and DSP ICs are usually employed to achieve the necessary
    functionality. Automatic test equipment applications have
    created opportunities for the design of application-specific ICs
    that require a high level of electronic circuitry.

Instrumentation

— Our instrumentation market
    includes engineering, medical and scientific instruments. These
    applications are usually designed using the highest performance
    analog and mixed-signal ICs available.



Customer products include oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, CT
    scanners, MRI equipment, blood analyzers and microscopes.

Defense/Aerospace

— The defense, commercial
    avionics and space markets all require high-performance ICs that
    meet rigorous environmental and reliability specifications. Many
    of our analog ICs can be supplied in versions that meet these
    standards. In addition, many products can be supplied to meet
    the standards required for broadcast satellites and other
    commercial space applications. Most of our products sold in this
    market are specifically-tested versions of products derived from
    our standard product offering. Customer products include
    navigation systems, flight simulators, radar systems and
    security devices.

Automotive

— Although the automotive market has
    historically been served with low-cost, low-performance ICs,
    demand has emerged for higher performance devices for a wide
    range of safety and entertainment applications. In response, we
    have developed products specifically for the automotive market.
    We supply a micromachined IC used as a crash sensor in airbag
    systems, roll-over sensing, global positioning satellite, or
    GPS, automotive navigation systems, anti-lock brakes and
    “smart” suspension systems. In addition, our analog
    and DSP ICs have application in engine control, in-cabin
    electronics, audio and collision avoidance systems.

Communications

— The development of
    broadband, wireless and Internet infrastructures around the
    world has created an important market for our communications
    products. Communications technology involves the acquisition of
    analog signals that are converted from analog to digital and
    digital to analog form during the process of transmitting and
    receiving data. The need for higher speed and reduced power
    consumption, coupled with more reliable, bandwidth-efficient
    communications, has been creating demand for our products. Our
    products are used in the full spectrum of signal processing for
    audio, data, image and video communication. In wireless and
    broadband communication applications, our products are
    incorporated into cellular handsets, cellular base station
    equipment, modems, pagers, PBX switches, routers and remote
    access servers.

Consumer Electronics

— Increased market
    demand for digital entertainment systems has allowed us to
    combine analog and digital design capability to provide
    solutions that are designed to meet the rigorous cost, size and
    reliability requirements of the consumer electronics market. The
    emergence of high-performance, feature-rich consumer products,
    such as digital camcorders and cameras, home theater systems,
    advanced flat-screen and plasma digital televisions, video
    projectors and high-definition DVD recorders/players, has
    created a market for our high-performance ICs with a high level
    of specific functionality.

Computers and Computer Peripherals

—
    Image and sound-enabled applications used in computer gaming and
    web sites and the increasing need for power and thermal
    management capability in PCs have provided opportunities for us
    in the computer market. The computer industry seeks to develop
    and market increasingly smaller and lighter personal computers.
    This need has increased demand for high-performance ICs that
    monitor power usage, enabling manufacturers to use smaller
    batteries and extend battery life between charges. In addition,
    we currently supply a variety of ICs used in this market for
    enhanced audio input and output capability for business and
    entertainment applications.

Research
    and Development

Our markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and
    advances. Accordingly, we make substantial investments in the
    design and development of new products and manufacturing
    processes, and the improvement of existing products and
    manufacturing processes. We spent approximately
    $537 million during fiscal 2006 on the design, development
    and improvement of new and existing products and manufacturing
    processes, compared to approximately $497 million during
    fiscal 2005 and approximately $514 million during fiscal
    2004.

Our research and development strategy focuses on building
    technical leadership in core technologies for signal sensing,
    conditioning, conversion and processing. In support of our
    research and development activities, we employ thousands of
    engineers involved in product and manufacturing process
    development at over 30 design centers and manufacturing sites
    located throughout the world.



Patents
    and Other Intellectual Property Rights

We seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our
    technology and products through the use of patents, copyrights,
    trademarks and trade secret laws. We have a program to file
    applications for and obtain patents, copyrights, and trademarks
    in the United States and in selected foreign countries where we
    believe filing for such protection is appropriate. We also seek
    to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by
    nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate
    confidentiality agreements. We have obtained a substantial
    number of patents and trademarks in the United States and in
    other countries. As of October 28, 2006, we held 1,202
    U.S. patents and had 513 non-provisional pending
    U.S. patent applications. There can be no assurance,
    however, that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced
    against infringing products in every jurisdiction. While our
    patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets provide some
    advantage and protection, we believe our competitive position
    and future success is largely determined by such factors as the
    system and application knowledge, innovative skills,
    technological expertise, and management ability and experience
    of our personnel, the range and success of new products being
    developed by us, our market brand recognition and ongoing
    marketing efforts, customer service and technical support. It is
    generally our policy to seek patent protection for significant
    inventions that may be patented, though we may elect, in certain
    cases, not to seek patent protection even for significant
    inventions, if other protection, such as maintaining the
    invention as a trade secret, to be more advantageous. We also
    have trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business to
    distinguish genuine Analog Devices products and we maintain
    cooperative advertising programs to promote our brands and
    identify products containing genuine Analog Devices components.
    In addition, we have registered certain of our mask sets, which
    are akin to the blueprint for building an IC, under the
    Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984.

There can be no assurance that any patent will issue on pending
    applications or that any patent issued will provide substantive
    protection for the technology or product covered by it. There
    also can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent
    similar technology or reverse engineer our products or that our
    confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, wafer
    foundries and other suppliers and vendors will be adequate to
    protect our interests. Moreover, the laws of countries in which
    we design, manufacture and market our products may afford little
    or no effective protection of our proprietary technology.

The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims
    and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property
    rights, including claims arising under our contractual
    indemnification of our customers. We have received from time to
    time, and may receive in the future, claims from third parties
    asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents
    or other intellectual property rights. In the event a third
    party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a
    license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms,
    or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop
    production of products incorporating that intellectual property,
    and our operating results could be materially and adversely
    affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or
    other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us
    against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be
    costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. See
    Note 13 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial
    Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for information concerning pending litigation that involves us.
    An adverse outcome in these matters or other litigation could
    have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
    position or on our consolidated results of operations or cash
    flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved.

Sales
    Channels

We sell our products in North America and internationally
    through a direct sales force, third-party distributors,
    independent sales representatives and via our worldwide website
    on the Internet.

Approximately 51% of our fiscal 2006 revenue was derived from
    sales made through distributors. Revenue is deferred on sales
    made through distributors until the distributors resell our
    products to the end customer, known as “100% sell out”
    or “100% sell through” in the industry. These
    distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products.
    Some of them also sell products competitive with our products,
    including those for which we are an alternate source. Sales to
    certain distributors are made under agreements that provide
    protection to the distributors for their inventory of our
    products including limited product return privileges and
    protection against price reductions and products that are
    slow-moving or that we have discontinued.



Approximately 25% of our fiscal 2006 net sales were to
    customers in North America. As of October 28, 2006, we had
    11 direct sales offices in the United States.

Approximately 22% of our fiscal 2006 net sales were to
    customers in Europe. As of October 28, 2006, we had direct
    sales offices in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France,
    Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United
    Kingdom.

Approximately 19% of our fiscal 2006 net sales were to
    customers in Japan. Approximately 13% of our fiscal
    2006 net sales were to customers in China and approximately
    21% were to customers elsewhere in Asia, principally Taiwan and
    Korea. As of October 28, 2006, we had direct sales offices
    in the Asia region in China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea,
    Singapore and Taiwan.

We also have sales representatives

and/or

distributors in over 45 countries outside North America,
    including countries where we also have direct sales offices. For
    further detail regarding revenue and financial information about
    geographic areas, see our Consolidated Financial Statements and
    Note 4 in the related Notes contained in Item 8 of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Our worldwide technical direct field sales efforts are supported
    by an extensive promotional program that includes editorial
    coverage and paid advertising in trade publications, direct mail
    programs, promotional brochures, technical seminars and
    participation in trade shows. We publish and distribute
    full-length databooks, product catalogs, applications guides,
    technical handbooks and detailed data sheets for individual
    products. We also provide product and application information
    and sell products via our worldwide website on the Internet. We
    maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid
    customers in incorporating our products into their products.

We have tens of thousands of customers worldwide. Our largest
    single customer, excluding distributors, represented
    approximately 3% of our fiscal 2006 net sales, and our 20
    largest customers, excluding distributors, accounted for
    approximately 29% of our fiscal 2006 net sales.

Seasonality

Sales to customers during our first fiscal quarter are sometimes
    lower than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our
    customers during the holiday season. In general, the seasonality
    for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on
    our results of operations. In addition, as explained in our risk
    factors, our revenue is more likely to be influenced on a
    quarter to quarter basis by cyclicality in the semiconductor
    industry.

Foreign
    Operations

Through subsidiaries and affiliates, we conduct business in
    numerous countries outside the United States. During fiscal
    2006, approximately 75% of our revenue was derived from
    customers in international markets. Our international business
    is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign
    operations, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
    rates and controls, import and export controls, and other laws,
    policies and regulations of foreign governments. Although we
    engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to
    currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance
    that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by
    changes in the exchange rate of the United States dollar against
    other currencies.

We have manufacturing facilities outside the United States in
    Ireland and the Philippines. In addition to being exposed to the
    ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry, we are
    also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in
    international operations and their impact on the United States
    economy in general, including the risks associated with ongoing
    uncertainties and political and economic instability in many
    countries around the world as well as the economic disruption
    from acts of terrorism, and the response to them by the United
    States and its allies. Other business risks associated with
    international operations include increased managerial
    complexities, air transportation disruptions, expropriation,
    currency controls, currency exchange rate movement, additional
    costs related to foreign taxes, tariffs and freight rate
    increases, exposure to different business practices and legal
    standards, particularly with respect to price protection and
    intellectual property, trade and travel restrictions, pandemics,
    import and export license requirements and restrictions,
    difficulties in staffing and managing worldwide operations, and
    accounts receivable collections.



Production
    and Raw Materials

Monolithic integrated circuit components are manufactured in a
    sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer
    fabrication, wafer testing, cutting the wafer into individual
    “chips,” or dice, assembly of the dice into packages
    and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form.
    The raw materials used to manufacture these devices include
    silicon wafers, processing chemicals (including liquefied
    gases), precious metals and ceramic and plastic used for
    packaging.

We develop and employ a wide variety of proprietary
    manufacturing processes that are specifically tailored for use
    in fabricating high-performance linear, mixed-signal and MEMS
    ICs. We also use bipolar and CMOS wafer fabrication processes.

Our IC products are fabricated both at our production facilities
    and by third-party wafer fabricators. Most of our analog
    products are manufactured in our own wafer fabrication
    facilities using proprietary processes. Our DSP products, and a
    portion of our analog products, are manufactured at third-party
    wafer-fabrication foundries using sub-micron digital CMOS
    processes. We operate wafer fabrication facilities in Wilmington
    and Cambridge, Massachusetts and Limerick, Ireland. We also
    operate test facilities located in the Philippines and use
    third-party subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our
    products. On November 9, 2006, we closed our Sunnyvale,
    California wafer fabrication facility and transferred virtually
    all of the production of products manufactured there to our
    facility in Wilmington, Massachusetts.

Capital spending in fiscal 2006 was $129.3 million,
    compared with $85.5 million in fiscal 2005. We currently
    plan to make capital expenditures of approximately
    $175 million in fiscal 2007.

Our products require a wide variety of components and raw
    materials, most of which we purchase from third-party suppliers.
    We have multiple sources for many of the components and
    materials we purchase and incorporate into our products.
    However, a large portion of our external wafer purchases are
    from sole-source suppliers, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor
    Manufacturing Company (TSMC). If these sole-source suppliers are
    unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient
    quantities of components to us, on the time schedule and of the
    quality that we require, we may be forced to seek to engage
    additional or replacement suppliers, which could result in
    additional expenses and delays in product development or
    shipment of product to our customers. Although we have
    experienced shortages of components from time to time, these
    items have generally been available to us as needed.

Backlog

Backlog at the end of fiscal 2006 was approximately
    $390 million, up from approximately $356 million at
    the end of fiscal 2005. We define backlog as of a particular
    date as firm orders with a customer or distributor requested
    delivery date within thirteen weeks. Backlog is impacted by the
    tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available
    from suppliers, including us, in periods of depressed demand. In
    periods of increased demand, there is a tendency towards longer
    lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and, in
    some instances, we may not have manufacturing capacity
    sufficient to fulfill all orders. As is customary in the
    semiconductor industry, we allow most orders to be canceled or
    deliveries delayed by customers without significant penalty.
    Accordingly, we believe that our backlog at any time should not
    be used as an indication of our future revenue.

In some of our markets where end-user demand may be particularly
    volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders
    that require us to manufacture product and have it available for
    shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a
    binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product.
    At any given time, this situation could affect a portion of our
    backlog. As a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing
    costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the
    risk of cancelation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of
    sales and backlog. Further, those orders may be for products
    that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those
    canceled orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of
    unsaleable products, resulting in potential inventory
    write-offs. As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles, for
    some of our products that are subject to these uncertainties,
    the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial.



Government
    Contracts

We estimate that approximately 3% of our fiscal 2006 revenue was
    attributable to sales to the U.S. government and government
    contractors and subcontractors. Our government contract business
    is predominantly in the form of negotiated, firm fixed-price
    subcontracts. All such contracts and subcontracts contain
    standard provisions relating to termination at the election of
    the United States government.

Acquisitions,
    Divestitures and Investments

An element of our business strategy involves expansion through
    the acquisition of businesses, assets, products or technologies
    that allow us to complement our existing product offerings,
    expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce
    or enhance our technological capabilities. From time to time, we
    consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen our
    business.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2006, we completed the sale to
    Ikanos Communications, Inc. of our DSP-based digital subscriber
    line (DSL) application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and
    network processor product line.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we completed a transaction
    with TTPCom Limited (TTPCom), whereby TTPCom transferred to us
    intellectual property, engineering resources, and related assets
    associated with the support and customization of TTPCom’s
    GSM/GPRS/EDGE modem software for use on our existing and future
    generations of
    SoftFone

®

baseband processors. As a result, we became the single point of
    contact for both hardware and software support for our new and
    existing wireless handset customers.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we acquired substantially
    all of the outstanding stock of privately held Integrant
    Technologies, Inc., an innovator in the field of
    high-performance analog circuits designed for reconfigurable
    radio frequency (RF) signal processing, and a leading supplier
    of low-power radio tuners that allow mobile communications,
    computer, and consumer devices to receive digital television
    (TV) and digital radio broadcasts.

Also in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we acquired privately
    held AudioAsics A/S, a developer of high-performance, low-power
    microphone and audio signal conditioning technology resulting in
    miniature, low-power audio solutions that provide better sound
    quality in portable consumer and communications products such as
    MP3 players, wireless cellular phones and PDAs.

Competition

We compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets
    that are highly competitive. We believe we are one of the
    largest suppliers of high-performance analog and mixed-signal
    processing components. Competitors for our analog and DSP
    products include Broadcom Corporation, Cirrus Logic Inc.,
    Infineon Technologies, Intersil Corporation, Linear Technology
    Corporation, Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., National
    Semiconductor Corporation, NXP Semiconductors, ST
    Microelectronics and Texas Instruments, Inc. Sales of our
    micromachined products currently consist of acceleration sensors
    and gyroscopes, and our main competitors in that market are
    Bosch, Denso Corporation, Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.,
    Panasonic, ST Microelectronics, Systron Donner and VTI
    Technologies.

We believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for
    real-world signal processing components depends upon several
    factors, including technical innovation, product quality and
    reliability, range of products, product price, customer service
    and technical support. We believe our technical innovation
    emphasizing product performance and reliability, supported by
    our commitment to strong customer service and technical support,
    enables us to compete in our chosen markets against both foreign
    and domestic semiconductor manufacturers.

Many other companies offer products that compete with our
    products, and some have greater financial, manufacturing,
    technical and marketing resources than we have. Some of our
    competitors may have better established supply or development
    relationships with our current and potential customers.
    Additionally, some formerly independent competitors have been
    purchased by larger companies. Our competitors also include
    emerging companies selling specialized products to markets we
    serve. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete
    successfully in the future against existing or new competitors,
    or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by
    increased price competition.



Environment

We are committed to protecting the environment and the health
    and safety of our employees, customers and the public. We
    endeavor to adhere to the most stringent standards across all of
    our facilities, to encourage pollution prevention and to strive
    towards continual improvement. We strive to exceed compliance
    with regulatory standards in order to achieve a standard of
    excellence in environmental, health and safety management
    practices as an integral part of our total quality management
    system.

Our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous
    environmental laws and regulations, particularly with respect to
    the storage, handling, use, discharge and disposal of certain
    chemicals, gases and other substances used or produced in the
    semiconductor manufacturing process. Compliance with these laws
    and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital
    expenditures, earnings, financial condition or competitive
    position. There can be no assurance, however, that current or
    future environmental laws and regulations will not impose costly
    requirements upon us. For example, restrictions adopted by the
    European Union regarding the use of hazardous substances have
    recently become applicable, requiring us to transition the
    manufacturing process for over 9,000 of our products. Any
    failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws and
    regulations could result in fines, suspension of production,
    alteration of fabrication processes and legal liability.

Employees

As of October 28, 2006, we employed approximately 9,800
    individuals worldwide. Our future success depends in large part
    on the continued service of our key technical and senior
    management personnel, and on our ability to continue to attract,
    retain and motivate qualified employees, particularly those
    highly-skilled design, process, test and applications engineers
    involved in the manufacture of existing products and the
    development of new products and processes. We believe that
    relations with our employees are good; however, the competition
    for such personnel is intense, and the loss of key personnel
    could have a material adverse impact on our results of
    operations and financial condition.



ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other
    documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and
    uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ
    materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking
    statements contained in this report.

Our
    future revenue and operating results are difficult to predict
    and may materially fluctuate.

Our future revenue and operating results are difficult to
    predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors,
    including changes in customer demand for our products and for
    end products that incorporate our products, the timing of new
    product announcements or introductions by us, our customers or
    our competitors, competitive pricing pressures, fluctuations in
    manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and other
    raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and test capacity,
    the risk that our backlog could decline significantly, the
    timing, delay or cancellation of significant customer orders and
    our ability to manage inventory, our ability to hire, retain and
    motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified
    employees to meet the demands of our customers, changes in
    product or customer mix, potential significant
    litigation-related costs, the effect of adverse changes in
    economic conditions in the United States and international
    markets and the effects of public health emergencies, natural
    disasters, terrorist activities, international conflicts and
    other events beyond our control. In addition, the semiconductor
    market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant
    economic downturns. Our business is subject to rapid
    technological changes and there can be no assurance, depending
    on the mix of future business, that products stocked in
    inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them. As
    a result of these and other factors, there can be no assurance
    that we will not experience material fluctuations in future
    revenue and operating results on a quarterly or annual basis. In
    addition, if our revenue and operating results do not meet the
    expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market
    price of our common stock may decline.

Long-term
    contracts are not typical for us and reductions, cancelations or
    delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our
    operating results.

In certain markets where end-user demand may be particularly
    volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders
    that require us to manufacture product and have it available for
    shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a
    binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product.
    At any given time, this situation could affect a portion of our
    backlog. As a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing
    costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the
    risk of cancelation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of
    sales and backlog. Further, those orders may be for products
    that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those
    canceled orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of
    unsaleable products, resulting in potential inventory
    write-offs. As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for
    certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties,
    the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial.
    Reductions, cancelations or delays in orders for our products
    could adversely affect our operating results.

Our
    future success depends upon our ability to continue to improve
    our products, develop and market new products, and enter new
    markets.

Our success significantly depends on our continued ability to
    improve our products and develop and market new products.
    Product development and enhancement is often a complex,
    time-consuming and costly process, and there can be no assurance
    that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved
    products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and
    improved products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance.
    Our products generally must conform to various evolving and
    sometimes competing industry standards, which may adversely
    affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us
    to incur significant costs. In addition, our customers generally
    impose very high quality and reliability standards on our
    products, which often change and may be difficult or costly to
    satisfy. Any inability to satisfy such quality standards or
    comply with industry standards and technical requirements, may
    adversely affect demand for our products and our results of
    operations. In addition, our growth is dependent on our
    continued ability to penetrate new markets where we have limited
    experience and competition is intense. There can be no assurance
    that the markets we serve will grow in the future, that our
    existing and new products will meet the requirements of these
    markets, that our products will achieve customer acceptance in
    these markets, that competitors will not force prices to an
    unacceptably low level or take market share from us, or



that we can achieve or maintain profits in these markets.
    Furthermore, a decline in demand in one or several of our
    end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the
    demand for our products and our results of operations. Also,
    some of our customers in these markets are less established,
    which could subject us to increased credit risk.

We may
    not be able to compete successfully in markets within the
    semiconductor industry in the future.

Many other companies offer products that compete with our
    products. Some have greater financial, manufacturing, technical
    and marketing resources than we have. Some of our competitors
    may have better established supply or development relationships
    with our current and potential customers. Additionally, some
    formerly independent competitors have been purchased by larger
    companies. Our competitors also include emerging companies
    selling specialized products in markets we serve. Existing or
    new competitors may develop products or technologies that more
    effectively address the demands of our markets with enhanced
    features and functionality, lower power requirements, greater
    levels of integration or lower cost. Increased competition in
    certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in
    declining average selling prices, reduced gross margins and loss
    of market share in such markets. There can be no assurance that
    we will be able to compete successfully in the future against
    existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will
    not be adversely affected by increased price competition.

We rely
    on third-party subcontractors and manufacturers for some
    industry-standard wafers and assembly/test services, and
    therefore cannot control their availability or conditions of
    supply.

We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on assembly and test
    subcontractors and on third-party wafer fabricators to supply
    most of our wafers that can be manufactured using
    industry-standard submicron processes. This reliance involves
    several risks, including reduced control over availability,
    capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields,
    quality assurance and costs. Additionally, we utilize
    third-party wafer fabricators as sole-source suppliers,
    primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. These
    suppliers manufacture components in accordance with our
    proprietary designs and specifications. We have no written
    supply agreements with these sole-source suppliers and purchase
    our custom components through individual purchase orders. In
    addition, these suppliers often provide manufacturing services
    to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry
    demand may result in capacity constraints. If these sole-source
    suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver
    sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule
    and of the quality that we require, we may be forced to seek to
    engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result
    in additional expenses and delays in product development or
    shipment of product to our customers.

We may
    not be able to satisfy increasing demand for our products, and
    increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower
    prices.

The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted
    in sustained and short-term periods when demand for our products
    has increased or decreased rapidly. During these periods of
    rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be
    sufficient to satisfy the available demand. In addition, we may
    not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a
    sufficiently timely manner, or locate suitable third-party
    suppliers, to respond effectively to changes in demand for our
    existing products or to the demand for new products requested by
    our customers, and our current or future business could be
    materially and adversely affected. Conversely, if we expand our
    operations and workforce too rapidly in anticipation of
    increased demand for our products, and such demand does not
    materialize at the pace at which we expect, our operating
    results may be adversely affected. These capacity expansions by
    us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to
    overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price
    erosion that would adversely impact our operating results.

Our
    revenue may not increase enough to offset the expense of
    additional capacity.

We, and the semiconductor industry generally, expand production
    facilities and access to third-party foundries in response to
    periods of increased demand which can cause operating expenses
    to increase. Should customer demand fail to increase or should
    the semiconductor industry enter a period of reduced customer
    demand, our financial position and results of operations could
    be adversely impacted as a result of increased operating
    expenses, reduced margins, underutilization of capacity or asset
    impairment charges.



We may be
    unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which may
    limit our ability to compete effectively.

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our
    intellectual property. We primarily rely on patent, copyright,
    trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure
    agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary
    technologies and processes. Despite our efforts to protect our
    proprietary technologies and processes, it is possible that
    competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain,
    copy, use or disclose our technologies and processes. Moreover,
    the laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture
    and market our products may afford little or no effective
    protection of our proprietary technology.

There can no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued
    patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In
    addition, any of our existing or future patents may be
    challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As such, any rights
    granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful
    protection. We may not have foreign patents or pending
    applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and
    applications. Even if foreign patents are granted, effective
    enforcement in foreign countries may not be available. If our
    patents do not adequately protect our technology, our
    competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours. Our
    competitors may also be able to develop similar technology
    independently or design around our patents. Other companies or
    individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of
    semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to
    obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from
    making and selling the infringing products, if such patents are
    found to be valid. There can be no assurance that we would be
    able to obtain licenses, if required, upon commercially
    reasonable terms, or at all.

We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our
    employees, consultants and strategic partners. We also try to
    control access to and distribution of our technologies,
    documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these
    efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy,
    disclose, obtain or use our products, services or technology
    without our authorization. Also, former employees may seek
    employment with our business partners, customers or competitors,
    and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of
    our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of
    such future employment.

We are
    involved in frequent litigation regarding intellectual property
    rights, which could be costly to bring or defend and could
    require us to redesign products or pay significant
    royalties.

The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims
    and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property
    rights, including claims arising under our contractual
    indemnification of our customers. We have received from time to
    time, and may receive in the future, claims from third parties
    asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents
    or other intellectual property rights. In the event a third
    party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a
    license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms,
    or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop
    production of products incorporating that intellectual property,
    and our operating results could be materially and adversely
    affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or
    other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us
    against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be
    costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. See
    Note 13 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial
    Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for information concerning certain pending litigation that
    involves us. An adverse outcome in these matters or other
    litigation could have a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results
    of operations or cash flows in the period in which the
    litigation is resolved.

If we do
    not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our
    business strategy will be limited.

Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued
    service of our executive officers and key management and
    technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers, and
    on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate
    qualified personnel. The competition for these employees is
    intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key
    personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating
    results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect
    on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key
    personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue
    to attract qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key
    person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees.



To remain
    competitive we may need to acquire other companies or purchase
    or license technology from third parties in order to introduce
    new products and services or enhance our existing products and
    services.

An element of our business strategy involves expansion through
    the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies
    that allow us to complement our existing product offerings,
    expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce
    or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to
    find businesses that have the technology or resources we need
    and, if we find such businesses, may not be able to purchase or
    license the technology or resources on commercially favorable
    terms or at all. Acquisitions and technology licenses are
    difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons,
    including the cost of potential transactions, competition among
    prospective buyers and licensees and the need for regulatory
    approvals. In order to finance a potential transaction, we may
    need to raise additional funds by selling our stock or borrowing
    money. We may not be able to find financing on favorable terms,
    and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our
    existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights
    that are superior to the rights of our common stockholders.
    Acquisitions also involve a number of risks, including:

•

difficulty integrating acquired technologies, operations and
    personnel with our existing businesses;

•

diversion of management attention in connection with both
    negotiating the acquisitions and integrating the assets;

•

strain on managerial and operational resources as management
    tries to oversee larger operations;

•

the future funding requirements for acquired companies, which
    may be significant;

•

potential loss of key employees;

•

exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired
    companies; and

•

increased risk of costly and time-consuming litigation.

If we are unable to successfully address these risks, we may not
    realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition,
    which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of
    operations.

We rely
    on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable
    areas, which could affect the availability of supplies and
    services.

We, and many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on
    internal manufacturing capacity, wafer fabrication foundries and
    other sub-contractors in geologically unstable locations around
    the world. This reliance involves risks associated with the
    impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry,
    including temporary loss of capacity, availability and cost of
    key raw materials and equipment and availability of key services
    including transport. Any prolonged inability to utilize one of
    our manufacturing facilities, or those of our subcontractors or
    third party wafer-fabrication foundries, as a result of fire,
    natural disaster, unavailability of electric power or otherwise,
    would have a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations and financial condition.

We are
    exposed to business, economic, political and other risks through
    our significant worldwide operations.

During fiscal 2006, approximately 75% of our revenue was derived
    from customers in international markets. Although we engage in
    hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange
    rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that our
    competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes
    in the exchange rate of the United States dollar against other
    currencies. Potential interest rate increases, particularly in
    the United States and China, as well as high energy costs could
    have an adverse impact on industrial and consumer spending
    patterns and could adversely impact demand for our products. We
    have manufacturing facilities outside the United States in
    Ireland and the Philippines. In addition to being exposed to the
    ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry, we are
    also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in
    international operations and their impact on the United States
    economy in general, including the risks associated with ongoing
    uncertainties and political and economic instability in many
    countries around the world as well as the economic disruption
    from acts of terrorism, and the response to them by the United
    States and its allies. Other business risks associated with
    international operations include increased managerial
    complexities, air transportation disruptions, expropriation,
    currency



controls, currency exchange rate movement, additional costs
    related to foreign taxes, tariffs and freight rate increases,
    exposure to different business practices and legal standards,
    particularly with respect to price protection and intellectual
    property, trade and travel restrictions, pandemics, import and
    export license requirements and restrictions, difficulties in
    staffing and managing worldwide operations, and accounts
    receivable collections.

Our
    future operating results are dependent on the performance of
    independent distributors and sales representatives.

A significant portion of our sales are through independent
    distributors that are not under our control. These independent
    distributors generally represent product lines offered by
    several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts
    applied to our products or terminate their representation of us.
    We generally do not require letters of credit from our
    distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable
    default or bankruptcy by these distributors. Our inability to
    collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our
    results of operations. Termination of a significant distributor,
    whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative,
    could disrupt our current business. If we are unable to find
    suitable replacements in the event of terminations by
    significant distributors or sales representatives, our operating
    results could be adversely affected.

Our
    manufacturing processes are highly complex and may be
    interrupted.

We have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial
    amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits
    is a highly complex and precise process. Minute impurities,
    contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in
    the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer
    manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer
    breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of
    wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be
    nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in
    semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes
    could become unstable. This instability could result in
    manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial position or results of
    operations.

Our stock
    price may be volatile.

The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the
    past and may be volatile in the future, as it may be
    significantly affected by the following factors:

•

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating
    results;

•

changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our
    failure to perform in line with such estimates;

•

changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies;

•

announcements by us or our competitors of significant new
    products, technical innovations, acquisitions or dispositions,
    litigation or capital commitments; and

•

departures of key personnel.

The stock market has historically experienced volatility,
    especially within the semiconductor industry, that often has
    been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. These
    market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless
    of our operating results.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

Tentative
    Settlement of the SEC’s Previously Announced Stock Option
    Investigation

In the Company’s

Form 10-K

filing dated November 30, 2004, the Company disclosed that
    the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had initiated an
    inquiry into its stock option granting practices, focusing on
    options that were granted shortly before the issuance of
    favorable financial results. On November 15, 2005, the
    Company announced that it had reached a tentative settlement
    with the SEC.

Since receiving notice of this inquiry, the Company has
    cooperated with the SEC. The Company and its President and CEO,
    Mr. Jerald G. Fishman, have made an offer of settlement to
    the Staff of the SEC, which is subject to agreement regarding
    the specific language of the SEC’s administrative order and
    other settlement documents. The SEC Staff has decided to
    recommend the offer of settlement to the Commission. A final
    settlement is subject to review and approval by the Commission.

The contemplated settlement addresses two separate issues. The
    first issue concerns the Company’s disclosure regarding
    grants of options to employees and directors prior to the
    release of favorable financial results. Specifically, the issue
    relates to options granted to employees

(

including
    officers

)

of the Company on November 30, 1999 and to
    employees

(

including officers

)

and directors of
    the Company on November 10, 2000. The SEC settlement would
    conclude that the Company should have made disclosures in its
    proxy filings to the effect that the Company priced these stock
    options prior to releasing favorable financial results.

The second issue addressed by the tentative settlement concerns
    the grant dates for options granted to employees

(

including officers

)

in 1998 and 1999, and the
    grant date for options granted to employees (including
    officers

)

and directors in 2001. Specifically, the
    settlement would conclude that the appropriate grant date for
    the September 4, 1998 options should have been
    September 8th (which is one trading day later than the
    date that was used to price the options); the appropriate grant
    date for the November 30, 1999 options should have been
    November 29th (which is one trading day earlier than
    the date that was used); and the appropriate grant date for the
    July 18, 2001 options should have been
    July 26th (which is five trading days after the
    original date).

In connection with the contemplated settlement, the Company
    would consent to a

cease-and-desist

order under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act
    and

Rule 10b-5

thereunder, would pay a civil money penalty of $3 million,
    and would reprice options granted to Mr. Fishman and other
    directors in certain years. Options granted to all other
    employees would be excluded from the repricing. Mr. Fishman
    would consent to a

cease-and-desist

order under Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the
    Securities Act, would pay a civil money penalty of
    $1 million, and would make a disgorgement payment with
    respect to options granted in certain years. With the exception
    of options granted in 1998, Mr. Fishman has not exercised
    or sold any of the options identified in this matter. The
    Company and Mr. Fishman would settle this matter without
    admitting or denying the Commission’s findings.

The Company has determined that no restatement of its historical
    financial results would be necessary due to the proposed
    settlement, because the effects of using revised measurement
    dates for options granted in 1998, 1999 and 2001 are not
    material to any of the fiscal years 1998 through 2005, based on
    the materiality guidelines contained in SAB 99. If a
    stock-based compensation charge had been taken as a result of
    the revised measurement dates for these option grants to all
    employees (including officers) and directors, the net income of
    the Company for fiscal years 1998 through 2005 would have been
    reduced by $21.8 million in total. During this period, the
    Company earned cumulative net income of over $2.5 billion.
    There would be no impact on revenue, cash flow from operations,
    or shareholders’ equity as a result of using the revised
    measurement dates. The impact on net income in individual fiscal
    years would have been as follows: fiscal 1998
    ($0.2 million), fiscal 1999 ($1.4 million), fiscal
    2000 ($1.8 million), fiscal 2001 ($3.7 million),
    fiscal 2002 ($8.1 million), fiscal 2003
    ($6.1 million), fiscal 2004 ($0.5 million).

Other
    Legal Proceedings

On November 6, 2003, Enron Corporation commenced a
    proceeding in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
    Southern District of New York. On December 1, 2003, Enron
    filed an amended complaint to add the Company as a defendant in
    such proceeding. The amended complaint alleged that transfers
    made by Enron in satisfaction of obligations it had under
    commercial paper were recoverable as preferential transfers and
    fraudulent transfers and



subject to avoidance under the United States Bankruptcy Code. It
    was alleged that payments made in premature satisfaction of
    obligations under commercial paper totaling approximately
    $20 million were recoverable from J.P. Morgan
    Securities, Inc., Fleet Capital Markets, Fleet National Bank

and/or

the
    Company. The Company sold $20 million of Enron commercial
    paper to Fleet and did not enter into any direct transactions
    with Enron. The Company has reached a settlement with Enron,
    pursuant to which we contributed $2.3 million towards a
    settlement of claims brought by Enron against both the Company
    and Bank of America (as successor to Fleet Capital Markets and
    Fleet National Bank). The settlement was submitted to and
    approved by the Bankruptcy Court. In accordance with the terms
    of the settlement, a stipulation of dismissal of all claims
    against the Company with prejudice has been executed by Enron,
    Bank of America and the Company and was filed with the
    Bankruptcy Court on November 9, 2006. The Bankruptcy Court
    entered the stipulation of dismissal on November 13, 2006.

On June 14, 2005, Biax Corporation filed its first amended
    complaint for patent infringement in the United States District
    Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the Company and
    Intel Corporation, alleging that the Company infringed three
    patents owned by Biax relating to parallel processors. Prior to
    the filing of the first amended complaint, the Company was
    unaware of Biax or this action. The first amended complaint
    seeks injunctive relief, unspecified damages with interest, as
    well as Biax’s costs, expenses and fees. On August 3,
    2005, the Company filed an answer and counterclaimed against
    Biax. In the counterclaim, the Company seeks rulings that the
    patents are not infringed, the patents are invalid and the
    patents are unenforceable. On November 7, 2005, Biax filed
    a second amended complaint alleging that the Company infringed
    two additional patents. The case is currently in the discovery
    phase. The Company intends to vigorously defend against these
    allegations. The Company is unable at this time to predict the
    outcome of this litigation; however, the Company believes that
    the final disposition of this matter will not have a material
    adverse effect on the Company or its financial position.

On or about May 5, 2006, Mr. Gregory Bender filed a
    complaint for patent infringement in the U.S. District
    Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the Company.
    Prior to the filing of the complaint, the Company was unaware of
    Mr. Bender or this action. In his complaint,
    Mr. Bender alleges that certain of the Company’s
    amplifier products infringe a patent Mr. Bender owns. He
    seeks unspecified damages as well as a permanent injunction
    enjoining the Company from infringing his patent.
    Mr. Bender has served his complaint on the Company and the
    Company has filed an answer. The Company intends to vigorously
    defend against these allegations. The Company cannot predict the
    outcome of this matter, but believes that the disposition of the
    matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company or
    its financial position.

In May 2006, the Company received a demand from a purported
    shareholder with respect to certain grants of options made to
    directors and officers of the Company during the years 1998,
    1999 and 2001. That demand seeks, among other things

,

the
    commencement of an action by the directors of the Company on
    behalf of the Company against those directors and officers for
    breach of fiduciary duties arising from the granting of the
    options. A special committee of the Board of Directors of the
    Company was formed to review the allegations contained in the
    demand and to respond appropriately. After reviewing the facts
    underlying the allegations, the special committee decided to
    reject the purported shareholder’s demand. The Company does
    not know whether the purported shareholder will take further
    action.

In May 2006, the Company received a document subpoena from the
    U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York
    requesting records from 2000 to the present relating to the
    Company’s granting of stock options. The Company believes
    that the options at issue in this matter are the same option
    grants which have been the subject of investigation by the SEC.
    The Company is cooperating with the office of the
    U.S. Attorney in connection with this subpoena. The Company
    cannot predict the outcome of this matter, but believes the
    disposition of the matter will not have a material adverse
    effect on the Company or its financial position.

On June 12, 2006, a purported derivative complaint was
    filed in the United States District Court for the District of
    Massachusetts naming the Company as nominal defendant and also
    naming as defendants certain officers and directors of the
    Company. The complaint alleged purported violations of state and
    federal law in connection with the Company’s option
    granting practices during the years 1998, 1999 and 2001,
    including violation of Section 14(a) of the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, breaches of fiduciary duties of care,
    loyalty and good faith, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate
    assets, and unjust enrichment. The complaint sought monetary
    damages in unspecified amounts, as well as equitable and
    injunctive relief. On October 12, 2006, the United States
    District Court for the



District of Massachusetts dismissed the plaintiff’s
    complaint with prejudice and without leave to amend. The Company
    does not know whether the plaintiff will appeal the court’s
    decision or otherwise pursue the action further.

In August 2006, the Company received a demand from a purported
    shareholder to inspect the Company’s books and records
    relating to certain grants of options made to directors and
    officers of the Company at diverse times. On September 8,
    2006, the Company responded to the letter and indicated that the
    purported shareholder was not entitled to the documents sought
    in the demand. The Company does not know whether the purported
    shareholder will take further action.

On October 13, 2006, a purported class action complaint was
    filed in the United States District Court for the District of
    Massachusetts on behalf of participants in the Company’s
    Investment Partnership Plan from October 5, 2000 to the
    present. The complaint named as defendants the Company, certain
    officers and directors, and the Company’s Investment
    Partnership Plan Administration Committee. The complaint alleges
    purported violations of federal law in connection with the
    Company’s option granting practices during the years 1998,
    1999, 2000, and 2001, including breaches of fiduciary duties
    owed to participants and beneficiaries of the Company’s
    Investment Partnership Plan under the Employee Retirement Income
    Security Act. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages,
    as well as equitable and injunctive relief. The Company intends
    to vigorously defend against these allegations. Although the
    Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the asserted
    claims, it is unable at this time to predict the outcome of this
    proceeding.

From time to time as a normal incidence of the nature of the
    Company’s business, various claims, charges and litigation
    are asserted or commenced against the Company arising from, or
    related to, contractual matters, patents, trademarks, personal
    injury, environmental matters, product liability, insurance
    coverage and personnel and employment disputes. As to such
    claims and litigation the Company can give no assurance that it
    will prevail.

While the Company does not believe that any of the matters
    described above will have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial position, an adverse outcome of any of
    these matters is possible and could have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations
    or cash flows in the quarter or annual period in which one or
    more of these matters are resolved.

Net sales increased $184.4 million, or 8% in fiscal 2006,
    from the amount recorded in fiscal 2005. The increase in net
    sales in fiscal 2006 was offset by the impact of a
    $41 million decrease in sales in fiscal 2006 as compared to
    fiscal 2005 as a result of the loss of sales from our DSP-based
    DSL ASIC and network processor product line that we sold in the
    second quarter of fiscal 2006. Net sales declined
    $245 million, or 9%, in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004.

Revenue
    Trends by End Market

The categorization of sales by end market is determined using a
    variety of data points including the technical characteristics
    of the product, the “sold to” customer information,
    the “ship to” customer information and the end
    customer product or application into which our product will be
    incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this
    data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end
    market can vary over time and when



this occurs we reclassify sales by end market for prior periods.
    Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the
    sizing, or the underlying trends of results within each end
    market.

Industrial

— Revenue from products sold into
    the industrial end market (which includes factory automation,
    scientific and medical instrumentation, semiconductor automatic
    test equipment (ATE), defense electronics and automotive
    applications) increased 15% in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal
    2005. The increase reflects a broad based increase in demand for
    our products across a wide range of customers in this end
    market. The industrial end market represented approximately 42%
    of our total revenue in fiscal 2006. Sales to customers in the
    industrial end market decreased 1% from fiscal 2004 to fiscal
    2005 as a result of a decline in revenues from our customers in
    the automatic test equipment market in the first half of fiscal
    2005. The industrial end market represented approximately 39%
    and 36% of our total revenue in fiscal years 2005 and 2004,
    respectively.

Computer

— Revenue from products sold into the
    computer end market declined 10% in fiscal 2006 as compared to
    fiscal 2005. The decline was primarily the result of refocusing
    our power management portfolio, lower sales of our personal
    computer audio codecs and an overall slow down in the personal
    computer market. The computer end market represented
    approximately 12% of our total revenue in fiscal 2006. Revenue
    from products sold into the computer end market decreased 11% in
    fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. The computer end market
    represented approximately 14% of our total revenue in fiscal
    years 2005 and 2004.

Communications

— Revenue from products sold
    into the communications end market increased 2% in fiscal 2006
    compared to fiscal 2005 as a result of an increase in sales of
    our products used in basestations. These increases were offset
    by decreases in wireless handset revenue and decreases in sales
    to networking customers. The sales decline attributable to
    networking customers was approximately $41 million and was
    the result of the loss of sales from our DSP-based DSL ASIC and
    network processor product line, which we sold in the second
    quarter of fiscal 2006. The communications end market
    represented approximately 29% of our total revenue in fiscal
    2006. Revenue from products sold into the communications end
    market declined 23% in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. The
    decline was primarily the result of a significant decline in
    revenues from wireless handset customers in fiscal 2005. The
    communications end market represented approximately 31% and 37%
    of our total revenue in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Consumer

— Revenue from products sold into the
    consumer end market increased 16% in fiscal 2006 as compared to
    fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily the result of the
    success of our products in digital home applications and to a
    lesser extent in digital cameras and a broad array of audio and
    video applications. The consumer end market represented
    approximately 17% of our total revenue in fiscal 2006. Revenue
    from sales in the consumer end market increased 9% in fiscal
    2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. The consumer end market
    represented approximately 16% and 13% of our total revenue in
    fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively.



Revenue
    Trends by Product

The following table summarizes sales trends by product
    categories showing what proportion of our total sales are
    represented by each product category as well as the annual
    sequential growth rates for each product category. The
    categorization of our products into broad categories is based on
    the characteristics of the individual products, the
    specification of the products and in some cases the specific
    uses that certain products have within applications. The
    categorization of products into categories is therefore subject
    to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances
    where products move between product categories we reclassify the
    amounts in the product categories for all prior periods Such
    reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing,
    or the underlying trends of results within each product category.

We sold our DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product
    line in the second quarter of fiscal 2006.



The sharp reduction in sales of DSP-based DSL ASIC and network
    processor products was a result of our decision to sell this
    product line in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. The wireless
    handset chipset sales are characterized by high sales volumes in
    periods of significant growth followed by periods of sales
    declines as demand for our product declines or shifts to our
    competition.

There was no major shift in the distribution of revenue by
    geographic region in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. The
    percentage of our net sales in China as a percentage of our
    total sales decreased in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004
    primarily as the result of the changes in sales into the
    wireless handset end markets.

The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily related to
    the increase in utilization of our wafer fabrication facilities
    and increased sales of higher margin products during fiscal 2006
    as compared to fiscal 2005. These increases were partially
    offset by stock-based compensation expense and restructuring
    related expenses, primarily accelerated depreciation of
    $18.3 million, included in cost of sales during fiscal
    2006. Gross margin included an aggregate $30.3 million of
    stock-based compensation expense, restructuring-related and
    acquisition-related expenses in fiscal 2006.

Gross margin declined in fiscal 2005 by 110 basis points
    from the gross margin recorded in fiscal 2004. The decline in
    gross margin was primarily the result of the effect of fixed
    manufacturing costs allocated across lower levels of production
    in fiscal 2005.

Stock-based
    Compensation Expense

During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, on October 30,
    2005, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
    (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment,

or SFAS 123R,
    using the modified prospective application method. Compensation
    cost is calculated on the date of grant using the fair value of
    the options as calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation
    model. The Black-Scholes valuation model requires us to make
    several assumptions. One of the key assumptions is expected
    volatility. For options granted prior to fiscal 2005, we used
    historical volatility to estimate the grant-date fair value of
    stock options. We changed our method of estimating expected
    volatility for all stock options granted after fiscal 2004 from
    exclusively relying on historical volatility to exclusively
    relying on implied volatility. This change was the result of a
    thorough review we undertook which included consultations with
    several third-party advisors. We currently believe that the
    exclusive use of implied volatility results in a more accurate
    estimate of the grant-date fair value of employee stock options
    because it more appropriately reflects the market’s current
    expectations of future volatility. Historical volatility during
    the period commensurate with the expected term of our stock
    options over the past several years included a period of time
    during which our stock price experienced unprecedented increases
    and subsequent declines. We believe that this past stock price
    volatility is unlikely to be indicative of future stock price
    behavior.



As a result of adopting SFAS 123R on October 30, 2005,
    the Company’s income before income taxes and net income for
    fiscal 2006, are $73.9 million and $52.6 million
    lower, respectively, than if it had continued to account for
    share-based compensation under APB Opinion 25. Basic and diluted
    earnings per share for the year ended October 28, 2006 are
    $0.15 and $0.14 lower, respectively, than if the Company had
    continued to account for share-based compensation under APB
    Opinion 25.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we accounted for
    share-based payments to employees under APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, using the
    intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognized no
    compensation cost for employee stock options. The adoption of
    SFAS 123R under the modified prospective application method
    allowed us to recognize compensation cost beginning with the
    effective date (a) based on the requirement of
    SFAS 123R for all share-based payments granted after the
    effective date and (b) based on the requirements of
    SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the
    effective date of SFAS 123R that remain unvested on the
    effective date. Under the modified prospective application
    method, prior periods are not restated for the effect of
    SFAS 123R. We used the graded attribution method to
    recognize expense for all options granted prior to the adoption
    of SFAS 123R. Upon adoption of SFAS 123R on
    October 30, 2005, we switched to the straight-line
    attribution method to recognize expense for all grants made
    after October 29, 2005. The expense associated with the
    unvested portion of the pre-adoption grants will continue to be
    expensed using the graded attribution method.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, on October 18,
    2005, we accelerated the vesting of all unvested stock options
    awarded to employees after December 31, 2000 that had
    exercise prices of $40.00 per share or greater. Options
    issued to our corporate officers and directors were not
    accelerated. Unvested options to purchase approximately
    18 million shares became exercisable as a result of the
    vesting acceleration. Because the exercise price of all the
    modified options was greater than the market price of our
    underlying common stock on the date of the modification, no
    stock-based compensation expense was recorded in the statement
    of income in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25. The
    primary purpose for modifying the terms of these

out-of-the-money

stock options to accelerate their vesting was to eliminate the
    need to recognize the remaining unrecognized non-cash
    compensation expense in our statement of income associated with
    these stock options as measured under SFAS 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, because the
    approximately $188 million ($134 million net of tax)
    of future expense associated with these options would have been
    disproportionately high compared to the economic value of the
    options at the date of modification.

As of October 28, 2006, the total compensation cost related
    to unvested awards not yet recognized in the statement of income
    was approximately $156.6 million, which will be recognized
    over a weighted average period of 1.7 years.

R&D expenses for fiscal 2006 increased by
    $39.7 million, or 8%, from the amount recorded in fiscal
    2005. The increase in R&D expense was primarily the result
    of recognizing $33.0 million of stock-based compensation
    expense due to the adoption of SFAS 123R and an increase in
    employee bonus expense. These increases were partially offset by
    the savings realized from the restructuring actions we initiated
    in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and the sale of our
    DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product line in the
    second quarter of fiscal 2006.

R&D expenses for fiscal 2005 decreased by $17 million,
    or 3%, from the amount recorded in fiscal 2004. The decrease in
    R&D expenses was caused by a $9 million reduction in
    employee bonus expenses and reductions in other expenses of
    $21 million as a result of our tight control over all other
    engineering expenses throughout the year. These expense
    reductions were partially offset by a $13 million increase
    in salary and employee benefit expenses.



R&D expense as a percentage of net sales will fluctuate from

year-to-year

depending on the amount of net sales and the success of new
    product development efforts, which we view as critical to our
    future growth. At any point in time we have hundreds of R&D
    projects underway, and we believe that none of these projects is
    material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the
    development of innovative technologies and processes for new
    products, and we believe that a continued commitment to R&D
    is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our
    existing products and to provide innovative new product
    offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make
    significant R&D investments in the future.

SMG&A expenses for fiscal 2006 increased $55.8 million,

    SMG&A expenses was primarily the result of recording
    $33.2 million of stock-based compensation expense related
    to the adoption of SFAS 123R and higher employee salary,
    employee benefit and employee bonus expenses. These increases
    were partially offset by savings realized from the restructuring
    actions we initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and
    the sale of our DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product
    line in the second quarter of fiscal 2006.

SMG&A expenses for fiscal 2005 decreased by $2 million,
    or 1%, from the levels recorded in 2004. The decrease in
    SMG&A expenses was caused by a reduction in employee bonus
    expenses of $4 million and reductions in other SMG&A
    expenses of $10 million as a result of tight control over
    all discretionary spending throughout the year. These expense
    reductions were partially offset by a $12 million increase
    in salary and employee benefit expenses.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we recorded a special
    charge of $20.3 million as a result of a decision to close
    our California wafer fabrication operations and transfer
    virtually all of the production of products manufactured there
    to our facility located in Wilmington, Massachusetts. The charge
    was for severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded
    pursuant to SFAS 88,

    Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans
    and for Termination Benefits

, or SFAS 88, under our
    ongoing benefit plan for 339 manufacturing employees and 28

    calculated based on length of past service, and employees must
    continue to be employed until they are involuntarily terminated
    in order to receive the severance benefit. As of
    October 28, 2006, 72 of these employees remained employed
    at our company. The employment of 42 of these employees was
    terminated on November 9, 2006. The remaining 30 employees
    will continue working over the next three months on the cleanup
    and closure of this wafer fabrication facility.



In addition to the charge recorded in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2005, we recorded additional expense during fiscal 2006,
    which consisted of $18.3 million of non-cash cost of sales
    expenses for additional depreciation due to shortened useful
    lives of certain manufacturing equipment and $2.0 million
    for stay-on bonuses. We reversed approximately $2.0 million
    of our severance accrual during fiscal 2006. The accrual
    reversal was required because some employees voluntarily left
    the company, other employees found alternative employment within
    the company, and there was an over accrual related to fringe
    benefits because severance payments, normally paid as income
    continuance, were paid as lump sum payments, which reduced the
    benefit costs associated with these payments.

We ceased production at the wafer fabrication facility on
    November 9, 2006. We expect to incur additional expenses
    related to this action in the first half of fiscal 2007 of
    approximately $12 million for lease termination,

clean-up

and
    closure costs. In accordance with SFAS 146,

Accounting
    for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,

the
    lease charge will be taken when we cease using the building and
    the cleanup and closure costs will be expensed as incurred. The
    closure of this facility is estimated to result in annual cost
    savings of approximately $50 million per year beginning in
    fiscal 2007. These annual savings are expected to be realized as
    follows: approximately $49 million in cost of sales, of
    which approximately $7 million relates to non-cash
    depreciation savings, and approximately $1 million in
    SMG&A expenses.

Reorganization
    of Product Development and Support Programs

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we recorded a special
    charge of $11.2 million as a result of our decision to
    reorganize our product development and support programs with the
    goal of providing greater focus on our analog and DSP product
    programs. The charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs
    that were recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing
    benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for
    60 manufacturing employees and 154 engineering and selling,
    marketing, general and administrative employees. These employees
    must continue to be employed until they are involuntarily
    terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. As of
    October 28, 2006, 23 of these employees were still employed
    by the company.

During fiscal 2006, we recorded an additional special charge of
    $3.8 million related to this reorganization action.
    Approximately $1.5 million of this charge was for lease
    obligation costs for a facility we ceased using during the first
    quarter of fiscal 2006 and the write-off of property, plant and
    equipment and other items. The remaining $2.3 million
    relates to the severance and fringe benefit costs that were
    recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 pursuant to
    SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory
    requirements at foreign locations for 46 engineering and
    selling, marketing, general and administrative employees. These
    employees must continue to be employed until they are
    involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance
    benefit. As of October 28, 2006, 35 of these employees were
    still employed by the company.

We do not expect to incur any further material charges related
    to this reorganization action. These organizational changes are
    expected to result in savings of approximately $25 million
    per year once fully completed by the end of the first quarter of
    fiscal 2007. These savings are expected to be realized as
    follows: approximately $14 million in R&D expenses,
    approximately $8 million in SMG&A expenses and
    approximately $3 million in cost of sales. A portion of
    these savings associated with the charge we recorded in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 have already been realized during
    the second half of fiscal 2006.

The $35.8 million increase in operating income in fiscal
    2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily the result of an
    8% increase in net sales and a 60 basis point increase in gross
    margin percentage. These increases were partially offset by
    $73.9 million of stock-based operating expenses associated
    with the adoption of SFAS 123R and the $21.7 million
    write-off of purchased in-process research and development from
    our recent acquisitions. The special charges in fiscal 2006 were
    lower by $29.7 million from the special charges recorded in
    fiscal 2005.



The decrease in operating income in fiscal 2005 as compared to
    fiscal 2004 was primarily a result of a 9% decrease in net
    sales, a 110 basis point decrease in gross margin combined
    with a $31.5 million special charge in fiscal year 2005
    partially offset by a decrease in operating expense.

Nonoperating income increased by $38.9 million in fiscal
    2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily the
    result of higher interest income, which was primarily
    attributable to higher interest rates in fiscal 2006 as compared
    to fiscal 2005. Non-operating income for fiscal 2006 also
    included a $13.0 million gain on the sale of our DSP-based
    DSL ASIC and network processor product line during the second
    quarter of fiscal 2006.

The

year-to-year

increase in interest income in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal
    2004 was primarily attributable to higher interest rates as well
    as higher average invested cash balances.

Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in
    effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where
    our income is earned. The tax rate was lower in fiscal 2006
    compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the recording of tax
    benefits of $35.2 million associated with the completion of
    an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination during fiscal
    2006, including the reversal of penalty accruals and the filing
    of refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the
    completion of the IRS audit. In addition, the effective tax rate
    was higher in fiscal 2005 as a result of our repatriation of
    foreign earnings and the write-off of deferred tax assets
    associated with balances accumulated in our deferred
    compensation plan as more fully described below.

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of
    2004, or the AJCA, was signed into law. The AJCA created a
    temporary incentive for US multinational corporations to
    repatriate accumulated foreign income by providing an 85%
    dividends received deduction for certain dividends from
    controlled foreign corporations. During fiscal 2005, we
    repatriated $1,055 million of accumulated foreign earnings.
    Under current tax law, the earnings repatriated prior to
    October 29, 2005 were taxed at a reduced effective tax
    rate. As a result of this action, we recorded additional income
    tax expense of $49 million in fiscal 2005.

We had originally established a deferred tax asset on our
    consolidated balance sheet with the expectation that the
    officers subject to the 162(m) limitation of the Internal
    Revenue Code would not withdraw their balances from the Analog
    Devices, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, or the deferred
    compensation plan, while they were still subject to the 162(m)
    limitation, and we would receive a tax deduction at the time of
    withdrawal, generally upon their retirement. Due to changes in
    tax law during 2005 that were enacted as part of the AJCA, the
    laws associated with distributions from deferred compensation
    plans have changed. As a result, in fiscal 2005 three executive
    officers who were subject to the 162(m) limitation withdrew, or
    indicated their intention to withdraw a portion of their
    balances from the deferred compensation plan. We incurred
    additional income tax expense in fiscal 2005 of
    $7.2 million as a result of the write-off of deferred tax
    assets associated with balances accumulated in the deferred
    compensation plan.

Net income increased by $134.7 million in fiscal 2006 as
    compared to fiscal 2005, primarily as the result of the 8%
    increase in net sales, the improvement in gross margin
    percentage, the increase in nonoperating income and lower tax
    expense. This increase in net income was partially offset by a

year-to-year

increase in operating expenses of $87.5 million, primarily
    as a result of $66.2 million of stock-based operating
    expenses related to the adoption of SFAS 123R and
    $23.1 million of operating expenses related to the our
    acquisitions during fiscal 2006. These operating expense
    increases were partially offset by a $29.7 million decrease
    in special charges in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005.

Net income decreased by $156 million in fiscal 2005 as
    compared to fiscal 2004. This decrease was primarily the result
    of the

year-to-year

decrease in net sales, a $49 million tax charge related to
    the repatriation of foreign earnings and $31 million of
    special charges recorded in fiscal 2005. The decrease in net
    income was partially offset by a $36 million increase in
    interest income.

The impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate
    movement on our business during the past three fiscal years has
    not been significant.

Acquisitions

In the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we completed a transaction
    with TTPCom Limited (TTPCom), whereby TTPCom transferred to us
    intellectual property, engineering resources, and related assets
    associated with the support and customization of TTPCom’s
    GSM/GPRS/EDGE modem software for use on our existing and future
    generations of SoftFone(R) baseband processors. We also acquired
    development rights for AJAR, TTPCom’s advanced applications
    platform. As a result of this transaction, we are the single
    point of contact for both hardware and software support for our
    new and existing wireless handset customers, thus improving our
    abilities to service the needs of individual customers. We paid
    $11.9 million in initial cash payments and may become
    obligated to make additional cash payments of up to an aggregate
    of $12 million based on the achievement of technological
    milestones during the period from May 2006 through November
    2006. The purchase price was allocated to the tangible and
    intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values
    at the date of acquisition. The estimated fair values of the
    assets exceeded the initial payments by $7.8 million,
    resulting in negative goodwill. Pursuant to Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No 141,

Business
    Combinations,

we recorded a liability for the contingent
    consideration that will be accounted for as additional purchase
    price, up to the amount of the negative goodwill. As contingent
    payments become due, the payments will be applied against the
    contingent liability. Contingent payments in excess of
    $7.8 million, if any, will be recorded as additional
    purchase price. As of October 28, 2006, we had paid
    $6 million of contingent payments, and the remaining
    contingent liability was $1.8 million. The purchase price
    included $5.5 million of in-process technology that had not
    yet reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future
    use and was charged to operations during the third quarter of
    fiscal 2006. The in-process technology related to software code
    developed for use in our semiconductor chipsets manufactured for
    devices that use both the 2G and 2.5G cellular wireless
    technology standards. The fair value of the in-process
    technology was determined by a third party using the income
    forecast method, which is a discounted net cash flow approach.
    At the time of the acquisition, the in-process technology was
    approximately 56% complete. As of October 28, 2006, the
    in-process research and development projects are on schedule. We
    expect to complete these projects in the first quarter of fiscal
    2007 and incur an additional $1.3 million of expense
    related to these projects. The acquisition also included
    $13.2 million of intangible assets that will be amortized
    over their estimated useful lives of five years using an
    accelerated amortization method that reflects the estimated
    pattern of economic use.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we acquired substantially
    all the outstanding stock of privately-held Integrant
    Technologies, Inc. (Integrant) of Seoul, Korea. The acquisition
    enabled us to enter the mobile TV market as well as strengthened
    our presence in the Asian region. We paid $127.2 million in
    initial cash payments at closing



and may be obligated to make additional cash payments of up to
    an aggregate of $33 million upon the satisfaction of
    certain conditions. The initial cash payments include
    $4.2 million held in escrow for the purchase of the
    remaining non-founder outstanding shares. The preliminary
    purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible
    assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date
    of acquisition. We expect to complete the purchase accounting in
    the first quarter of fiscal 2007 upon obtaining certain
    additional information. The $33 million of potential cash
    payments is comprised of $25 million for the achievement of
    revenue-based milestones that may be payable during the period
    from July 2006 through December 2007 and $8 million related
    to the purchase of shares from the founder of Integrant during
    the period from July 2007 through July 2009. The additional cash
    payments, if any, will be recorded as additional purchase price.
    The purchase price included $11.1 million of in-process
    technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility,
    had no alternative future use and was charged to operations
    during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The in-process
    technology related to technologies currently in development for
    Dual DAB, T-DMB, DVB-H, RFID and WiBro applications.
    The fair value of the in-process technology was determined by a
    third-party using the income forecast method, which is a
    discounted net cash flow approach. At the time of the
    acquisition, the in-process technology was approximately 74%
    complete. As of October 28, 2006, the in-process research
    and development projects are on schedule. We expect to complete
    the projects in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and incur an
    additional $3.3 million of expense related to these
    projects. The acquisition also included $21.6 million of
    intangible assets that will be amortized over their estimated
    useful lives of two to five years using an accelerated
    amortization method that reflects the estimated pattern of
    economic use.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we acquired all the
    outstanding stock of privately-held AudioAsics

A/S (AudioAsics)

of Roskilde, Denmark. The acquisition of AudioAsics allows us to
    continue developing our low-power audio solutions, while
    expanding our presence in the Nordic and Eastern European
    regions. We paid $19.3 million in initial cash payments at
    closing and may be obligated to make additional cash payments of
    up to an aggregate of $8 million upon the satisfaction of
    certain conditions. The purchase price was allocated to the
    tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated
    fair values at the date of acquisition. The $8 million of
    potential cash payments is comprised of $4.8 million for
    the achievement of revenue-based milestones that may be payable
    during the period from October 2006 through January 2009 and
    $3.2 million based on the achievement of technological
    milestones during the period from October 2006 through January
    2009. In order to be entitled to receive $2.4 million of
    the revenue-based contingent consideration, certain key
    employees must continue to be employed by us. As such, that
    portion of the revenue-based contingent consideration will be
    recorded as compensation expense when, and if, it is earned. The
    technological milestones require post-acquisition services to be
    rendered in order to be achieved and, as such, will be recorded
    as compensation expense when earned. The purchase price included
    $5.1 million of in-process technology that had not yet
    reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use
    and was charged to operations during the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2006. The in-process technology related to technologies
    currently in development for analog and digital microphone

pre-amplifiers.

The fair value of the in-process technology was determined by a
    third party using the income forecast method, which is a
    discounted net cash flow approach. At the time of the
    acquisition, the in-process technology was approximately 69%
    complete. As of October 28, 2006, the in-process research
    and development projects are on schedule. We expect to complete
    the projects by April 2007 and incur an additional
    $1.0 million of expense related to these projects. The
    acquisition also included $8.3 million of intangible assets
    that will be amortized over their estimated useful lives of five
    years using an accelerated amortization method that reflects the
    estimated pattern of economic use.

Pro forma results of operations for TTPCom, Integrant and
    AudioAsics have not been provided herein as they were not
    material to us on either an individual or an aggregate basis.
    The results of operations of each acquisition are included in
    our consolidated statement of income from the date of such
    acquisition.

Related
    Party Transaction

One of our directors, who has served on our Board of Directors
    since 1988, became a director of Taiwan Semiconductor
    Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, in fiscal 2002 and continues to
    serve as a director of TSMC. Management believes the terms and
    prices for the purchases of products from TSMC are not affected
    by the presence of one of our directors on the Board of
    Directors of TSMC. We purchased approximately $281 million,
    $224 million and $337 million of products from TSMC in
    fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.



Approximately $17 million and $27 million were payable
    to TSMC as of October 28, 2006 and October 29, 2005,
    respectively. We anticipate that we will make significant
    purchases from TSMC in fiscal year 2007.

At October 28, 2006, cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments totaled $2,128 million, a decrease of
    $577.6 million from fiscal 2005. Our statement of cash
    flows reflects the impact of $181.2 million for allocating
    the excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options over a
    period of several years between the financing and operating
    section of the statement of cash flows, as required by
    SFAS 123R. The primary sources of funds for fiscal 2006
    were net cash generated from operating activities of
    $621.1 million (which is net of the $181.2 million of
    non-cash excess tax benefit discussed above),
    $305.6 million of cash inflows from the net change in our
    short-term

available-for-sale

investments, proceeds from the sale of a product line of
    $23.1 million and proceeds of $94.4 million from our
    various employee stock plans. The principal uses of funds during
    fiscal 2006 were the repurchase of approximately
    30.7 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of
    $1,025 million, cash dividend payments of
    $201.5 million, payments of $157.0 million for
    acquisitions and capital expenditures of $129.3 million.

During fiscal 2005, net cash provided by operations decreased by
    $105 million from the amount recorded in fiscal 2004
    primarily due to a decline in net income of $156 million.
    Cash and cash equivalents increased by $109 million during
    fiscal 2005. This increase was the result of $673 million
    of cash flow from operations, $89 million in proceeds from
    our various employee stock programs and $70 million of cash
    inflows from the net change in our short-term

available-for-sale

investments. These cash inflows were partially offset by the
    repurchase of $525 million of our common stock, the payment
    of $119 million of cash dividends and additions to
    property, plant and equipment of $85 million. Cash, cash
    equivalents and short-term investments increased by
    $21 million during fiscal 2005 to $2,706 million at
    October 29, 2005.

Accounts receivable at the end of fiscal 2006 increased by
    $8.9 million, or 3%, from the amount at the end of fiscal
    2005. This increase was the result of higher sales in the last
    month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 as compared to the
    last month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.

Inventories at the end of fiscal 2006 increased by
    $53.0 million, or 16%, from the amount at the end of fiscal
    2005 and days cost of sales in inventory at the end of fiscal
    2006 increased by 13 days from the amount at the end of
    fiscal 2005. Approximately $19.0 million of this increase
    relates to the inventory that was built in preparation for the
    planned closure of our wafer fabrication facility in California
    and approximately $3.7 million relates to the
    capitalization of manufacturing related stock-based compensation
    expense as a result of our adoption of SFAS 123R in the
    first quarter of fiscal 2006. The remainder of the increase
    primarily relates to increased inventory to support anticipated
    higher sales demand.

Current liabilities decreased to $490.9 million at
    October 28, 2006, a decrease of $328.0 million, or
    40%, from $818.9 million at the end of fiscal 2005. The
    decrease in current liabilities was largely the result of a
    $233.3 million net decrease in the current portion of the
    deferred compensation plan liability, primarily as a result of
    withdrawals by plan participants in response to certain
    provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act, as more fully
    described below. Additionally, income taxes payable at
    October 28, 2006 decreased by a net of $111.3 million
    compared to the end of fiscal 2005, which was primarily as a
    result of recording tax deductions in 2006 for stock options
    exercised



over a period of several years becoming available upon the
    completion of the IRS examination. These decreases were
    partially offset by a $27.7 million increase in deferred
    income on shipments to distributors due to the increase in
    inventory held by our distributors as a result of increases in
    demand for our products during fiscal 2006.

During fiscal 2006, we distributed $254.1 million from our
    amended and restated deferred compensation plan, or the Deferred
    Compensation Plan, as a result of participant terminations or at
    the direction of the participants. This amount represented
    compensation

and/or

stock
    option gains previously deferred by those participants pursuant
    to the terms of our Deferred Compensation Plan and earnings on
    those deferred amounts. As a result of certain provisions of the
    American Jobs Creation Act, participants had the opportunity
    until December 31, 2005 to elect to withdraw amounts
    previously deferred.

Net additions to property, plant and equipment were
    $129.3 million in fiscal 2006, $85.5 million in fiscal
    2005 and $146.2 million in fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2007 capital
    expenditures are expected to total approximately
    $175 million.

During fiscal 2006, our Board of Directors declared cash
    dividends totaling $0.56 per outstanding share of common
    stock resulting in dividend payments of $201.5 million in
    fiscal 2006. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be
    based on several factors including our financial performance,
    outlook and liquidity. After the end of the fiscal year, on
    November 13, 2006, our Board of Directors declared a cash
    dividend of $0.16 per outstanding share of our common
    stock. The dividend is payable on December 13, 2006 to
    shareholders of record on November 24, 2006 and is expected
    to total approximately $54 million.

On May 11, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized an
    increase in the aggregate dollar amount of common stock that may
    be repurchased under our share repurchase program previously
    adopted by our Board of Directors on August 11, 2004 from
    $500 million to $1 billion. On March 14, 2006,
    our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by us of an
    additional $1 billion of our common stock, increasing the
    total amount of our common stock we can repurchase from
    $1 billion to $2 billion of our common stock. Under
    the repurchase program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of
    our common stock from time to time in the open market and
    through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated
    earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase
    program will expire when we have repurchased all shares
    authorized for repurchase under the repurchase program. During
    fiscal 2006, we repurchased approximately $1,025 million of
    our common stock under this plan. During fiscal 2005, we
    repurchased approximately $525.5 million of our common
    stock under this program. As of October 28, 2006, we had
    $312.4 million of authorization remaining under our
    repurchase program.

(a)

Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation
    clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in
    the table.

(b)

These payments relate to obligations under our deferred
    compensation plan. The deferred compensation plan allows certain
    members of management and other highly-compensated employees and
    non-employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of
    their compensation. Prior to January 1, 2005, participants
    could also defer gains on stock options and restricted stock
    granted before July 23, 1997. The amount in the “More
    than 5 Years” column of the table represents the
    remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to
    be paid to participants who have not terminated employment.
    Since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals
    for participants who have not yet terminated employment we have
    included the future obligation to these participants in the
    “More than 5 Years” column of the table. All
    other columns represent installment payments to be made to those
    employees who have retired or are on long-term disability.



(c)

Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is
    consistent with the local requirements of each country. The
    payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected
    contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2007. The actual
    future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the
    table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are
    not practical because of potential future changes in variables
    such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of
    increase in compensation levels.

Purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other
    goods and services are not included in the table above. We are
    not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders
    that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may
    represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding
    agreements. In addition, our purchase orders generally allow for
    cancellation without significant penalties. We do not have
    significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or
    other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that
    exceed our expected short-term requirements.

The expected timing of payments and the amounts of the
    obligations discussed above are estimated based on current
    information.

At October 28, 2006, our principal source of liquidity was
    $2,128 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity
    and cash expected to be generated from future operations,
    together with anticipated available long-term financing, will be
    sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures and research
    and development efforts for at least the next twelve months and
    thereafter for the foreseeable future.

Off-balance
    Sheet Financing

As of October 28, 2006, we had no off-balance sheet
    financing arrangements.

Outlook

The following statements are based on current expectations.
    These statements are forward looking, and actual results may
    differ materially. These statements do not give effect to the
    potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or
    business combinations that may be announced or closed after the
    date of filing this report. These statements supersede all prior
    statements regarding business outlook made by the Company.
    Product sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 are planned to
    be approximately $635 to $670 million. This includes an
    additional week of operations as the first quarter of fiscal
    2007 will have a total of 14 weeks. In addition, revenue in
    the first quarter of fiscal 2007 will include a $35 million
    one-time, non-recurring payment received by us on
    November 9, 2006 in exchange for licensing certain
    intellectual property rights to a third party. Total revenue in
    the first quarter of fiscal 2007 is expected to range from $670
    to $705 million. Gross margin percentage is planned to be
    approximately 61.2% to 61.6% of revenue in the first quarter of
    fiscal 2007 which includes the impact of the $35 million
    one-time payment that has no cost of sales associated with it.
    Diluted EPS is planned to be approximately $0.36 to $0.42 for
    the first quarter of fiscal 2007.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

Accounting
    for Prior Year Misstatements

In September 2006, the United States Securities and Exchange
    Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB)
    No. 108,

Considering the Effects of Prior Year
    Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
    Financial Statements

(SAB 108). This SAB provides
    guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year
    misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the
    purpose of a materiality assessment. SAB 108 establishes an
    approach that requires quantification of financial statement
    errors based on the effects of each of the company’s
    balance sheet and statement of operations financial statements
    and the related financial statement disclosures. The SAB permits
    existing public companies to record the cumulative effect of
    initially applying this approach in the first year ending after
    November 15, 2006 by recording the necessary correcting
    adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as
    of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment
    recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings.
    Additionally, the use of the cumulative effect transition method
    requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each
    individual error being corrected



through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it arose. We
    are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that SAB 108
    may have on our financial condition, results of operations or
    liquidity.

Accounting
    for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS)
    No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
    Pension and Other Postretirement Plans — An Amendment
    of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132R

(SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires companies to
    recognize the funded status of pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans on sponsoring employers’ balance sheets and
    to recognize changes in the funded status in the year the
    changes occur. It also requires the measurement date of plan
    assets and obligations to occur at the end of the
    employers’ fiscal year. SFAS 158 is effective for us
    at the end of fiscal 2007, except for the change in measurement
    date, which is effective for us in fiscal 2008. The effect on
    our financial statements is dependent upon the discount rate at
    our fiscal 2007 measurement date (September 30,
    2007) and actual returns on our pension plan assets during
    the year. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that
    SFAS 158 may have on our financial condition, results of
    operations or liquidity.

Accounting
    for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(FIN 48).
    FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income
    taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in
    accordance with SFAS 109,

Accounting for Income
    Taxes.

FIN 48 prescribes a recognition
    threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
    recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected
    to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance
    on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties,
    accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.
    FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the impact,
    if any, that FIN 48 may have on our financial condition,
    results of operations or liquidity.

Accounting
    Changes and Error Corrections

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections

(SFAS 154) which supersedes APB Opinion
    No. 20,

Accounting Changes

and SFAS No. 3,

Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial
    Statements.

SFAS 154 provides guidance on the
    accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error
    corrections. It establishes, unless impracticable, retrospective
    application as the required method for reporting a change in
    accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition
    requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle.
    The correction of an error in previously issued financial
    statements is not an accounting change. However, the reporting
    of an error correction involves adjustments to previously issued
    financial statements similar to those generally applicable to
    reporting an accounting change retroactively. Therefore, the
    reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously
    issued financial statements is also addressed by this statement.
    SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and
    corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 154 during
    fiscal 2006 did not have a material impact on our financial
    condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Asset
    Retirements

In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47,

Accounting for
    Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143.

FIN 47
    clarifies that the term “conditional asset retirement
    obligation” as used in FASB Statement No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,

refers to a
    legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in
    which the timing and (or) method of settlement are conditional
    on a future event that may or may not be within the control of
    the entity. The obligation to perform the asset retirement
    activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about
    the timing and (or) method of settlement. Uncertainty about the
    timing and (or) method of settlement of a conditional asset
    retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of
    the liability when sufficient information exists. FIN 47
    also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information
    to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement
    obligation. FIN 47 is effective no



later than the end of fiscal years ending after
    December 15, 2005. The adoption of FIN 47 in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 did not impact our financial
    condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Inventory
    Costs

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,

Inventory Costs, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin
    (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4

(SFAS 151).
    SFAS 151 amends the guidance in ARB No 43, Chapter 4,
    “Inventory Pricing,” to clarify that abnormal amounts
    of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted
    material (spoilage) should be recognized as current-period
    charges. In addition, SFAS 151 requires that the allocation
    of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based
    on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The
    provisions of SFAS 151 are effective for fiscal years
    beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of
    SFAS 151 in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 did not impact
    our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of the financial
    condition and results of operations is based upon the
    consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States. The preparation of these financial statements
    requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
    reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses,
    and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We
    base our estimates and judgments on historical experience,
    knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur
    in the future given available information. We consider the
    following accounting policies to be both those most important to
    the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require
    the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ
    significantly from management’s estimates and projections,
    there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We
    also have other policies that we consider key accounting
    policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including
    the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the
    products are sold to the end user; however, the application of
    these policies does not require us to make significant estimates
    or judgments that are difficult or subjective.

Inventory
    Valuation

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of
    the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels,
    obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write
    down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of
    methodologies to determine the amount of inventory reserves
    necessary. While a portion of the reserve is determined via
    reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market
    calculations, an element of the reserve is subject to
    significant judgments made by us about future demand for our
    inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our
    estimates, additional reserves for existing inventories may need
    to be recorded in future periods.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate,
    for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our
    customers to make required payments. If the financial condition
    of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may
    exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be
    required.

Long-Lived
    Assets

We review property, plant, and equipment and identified
    intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not
    be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by
    comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash
    flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining
    economic lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired,
    the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by
    which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market
    value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a
    value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique.
    Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments
    related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified
    intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except
    those made in conjunction with restructuring actions,
    deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such
    impairment adjustments in future



periods. Evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires
    estimates of future operating results that are used in the
    preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows.
    Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives
    of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in
    assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences
    could result in impairment charges, which could have a material
    adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in
    certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their
    estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations,
    we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised
    useful lives.

Goodwill

In accordance with SFAS 142,

Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets,

goodwill is subject to annual impairment
    tests, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist
    and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be
    recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. Because
    we have one reporting segment under SFAS 142, we utilize
    the entity-wide approach to assess goodwill for impairment and
    compare our market value to our net book value to determine if
    an impairment exists. These impairment tests may result in
    impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on
    our results of operations.

Accounting
    for Income Taxes

We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes,

which requires that deferred
    tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates
    for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax
    bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS 109 also
    requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation
    allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all
    of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We evaluate the
    realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly. At
    October 28, 2006, we had gross deferred tax assets of
    $188.4 million primarily resulting from temporary
    differences between the book and tax bases of assets and
    liabilities. We have conducted an assessment of the likelihood
    of realization of those deferred tax assets and concluded that a
    $42.6 million valuation allowance is needed to reserve the
    amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due
    to the expiration of state credit carryovers. In reaching our
    conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the
    existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb
    deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years
    that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable
    income in future years. Our judgments regarding future
    profitability may change due to future market conditions,
    changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other
    factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments
    to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net
    income or an increase in net loss in the period when such
    determinations are made.

In the ordinary course of global business, there are many
    transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is
    uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of
    cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related
    entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no
    assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these
    matters will not be different than that which is reflected in
    our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such
    differences could have a material impact on our income tax
    provision and operating results in the period in which such
    determination is made.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The adoption of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of fiscal
    2006 requires that stock-based compensation expense associated
    with stock options and related awards be recognized in the
    statement of income, rather than being disclosed in a pro forma
    footnote to the consolidated financial statements. Determining
    the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires
    us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date
    fair value of stock options. We calculate the grant-date fair
    values using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The use of
    valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following
    assumptions:

Expected volatility

— We are responsible for
    estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors,
    including third-party estimates, when estimating volatility. For
    options granted prior to fiscal 2005, we used historical
    volatility to estimate the grant-date fair value of stock
    options. We changed our method of estimating expected volatility
    for all stock options granted after fiscal 2004 from exclusively
    relying on historical volatility to exclusively relying on
    implied volatility. This change was the result of a thorough
    review we undertook which



included consultations with several third-party advisors. We
    currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility
    results in a more accurate estimate of the grant-date fair value
    of employee stock options because it more appropriately reflects
    the market’s expectations of future volatility. Historical
    volatility during the period commensurate with the expected term
    of our stock options over the past several years included a
    period of time that our stock price experienced unprecedented
    increases and subsequent declines. We believe that this past
    stock price volatility is unlikely to be indicative of future
    stock price behavior. Options in our stock are actively traded
    on several exchanges. Implied volatility is calculated for the
    period that is commensurate with the option’s expected term
    assumption. Because this term often exceeds the period for which
    there are exchange-traded options in our stock, statistical
    techniques are used to derive the implied volatility for traded
    options with terms commensurate with the option’s expected
    term of five years. This calculation of implied volatility is
    derived from the closing prices of the Company’s stock and
    exchange traded options from the most recent five trading days
    prior to the grant date of the employee stock option. In
    general, the higher the expected volatility used in the
    Black-Scholes valuation model, the higher the grant-date fair
    value of the option.

Expected term

— We use historical employee
    exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected
    term assumption for the Black-Scholes grant date valuation. We
    believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate
    of the expected term of a new option, and that generally, all of
    our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior. In general, the
    longer the expected term used in the Black-Scholes valuation
    model, the higher the grant-date fair value of the option.

Risk-free interest rate

— The yield on
    zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is
    commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the
    risk-free interest rate.

Expected dividend yield

— Expected dividend
    yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by
    our Board of Directors for the current quarter and dividing that
    result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the
    option. Until such time as our Board of Directors declares a
    cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current
    quarter’s cash dividend, the current dividend will be used
    in deriving this assumption. Cash dividends are not paid on
    options, restricted stock or restricted stock units.

The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized during
    a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that
    are ultimately expected to vest. SFAS 123R requires
    forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if
    necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ
    from those estimates. The term “forfeitures” is
    distinct from “cancellations” or
    “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion
    of the surrendered option. We currently expect, based on an
    analysis of our historical forfeitures, that approximately 84%
    of our options will vest, and therefore have applied an annual
    forfeiture rate of 3.4% to all unvested options as of
    October 28, 2006. The 3.4% represents the portion that is
    expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period,
    therefore, the cumulative amount, on a compounded basis, that is
    expected to be forfeited is approximately 16% of the aggregate
    options granted. This analysis will be re-evaluated quarterly
    and the forfeiture rate will be adjusted as necessary.
    Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting
    period will only be for those shares that vest.

Contingencies

From time to time, we receive notices that our products or
    manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or
    intellectual property rights of others. We periodically assess
    each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be
    recorded in accordance with SFAS 5,

Accounting for
    Contingencies.

In making this determination, we may,
    depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and
    external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the
    information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all
    the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether
    it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and
    whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated.
    Should a loss be probable and reasonably estimable, we record a
    contingent loss in accordance with SFAS 5. In determining
    the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received
    from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal
    proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior
    case history and other factors. Should the judgments and
    estimates made by us be incorrect, we may need to record
    additional contingent losses that could materially adversely
    impact our results of operations. See Note 13 to our
    Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for information regarding our commitments and contingencies.



ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest
    Rate Exposure

Our annual interest income would change by approximately
    $16 million in fiscal 2006 and $16 million in fiscal
    2005 for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in
    interest rates. The fair values of our investment portfolio at
    October 28, 2006 and October 29, 2005 would change by
    approximately $6 million and $14 million,
    respectively, for each 100 basis point increase or decrease
    in rates.

Foreign
    Currency Exposure

As more fully described in Note 2 (i) in the Notes to
    our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8
    of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

we regularly hedge our

non-U.S. dollar-based

exposures by entering into forward exchange contracts. The terms
    of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the
    underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve
    months. The short-term nature of these contracts has resulted in
    these instruments having insignificant fair values at
    October 28, 2006 and October 29, 2005. Currently, our
    largest foreign currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because
    our European operations have a higher proportion of our local
    currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency
    exposures existing at October 28, 2006, and
    October 29, 2005, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign
    currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant
    losses in earnings or cash flows or significantly diminish the
    fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments,
    primarily due to the short lives of the affected financial
    instruments that effectively hedge substantially all of our
    year-end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency
    exchange rates. The calculation assumes that each exchange rate
    would change in the same direction relative to the
    U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes
    in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of
    sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’
    products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity
    analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or
    local currency selling prices.

Description
    of Business

Analog Devices, Inc. (“Analog Devices” or the
    “Company”) is a world leader in the design,
    manufacture and marketing of high-performance analog,
    mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits
    used in industrial, communication, computer and consumer
    applications. Since the Company’s inception in 1965, it has
    focused on solving the engineering challenges associated with
    signal processing in electronic equipment. Real world signal
    processing describes the process of converting real-world
    phenomena such as temperature, motion, pressure, light and sound
    into electrical signals to be used in a wide array of electronic
    equipment ranging from industrial process control, factory
    automation systems, defense electronics, portable wireless
    communications devices, cellular basestations, central office
    networking equipment, computers, automobiles, medical imaging
    equipment, digital cameras and digital televisions. Signal
    processing technology is a critical element of high-speed
    communications, digital entertainment, and other consumer,
    computer and industrial applications. As new generations of
    digital applications evolve, they generate new needs for
    high-performance analog signal processing and digital signal
    processing, or DSP, technology. The Company produces a wide
    range of products that are designed to meet the signal
    processing technology needs of a broad base of customers.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

a.  Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries. Upon
    consolidation, all intercompany accounts and transactions are
    eliminated. Amounts pertaining to the non-controlling ownership
    interest held by third parties in the operating results and
    financial position of the Company’s majority owned
    subsidiaries are reported as “minority interest.” The
    Company’s fiscal year is the

52-week

or

53-week

period ending on the Saturday closest to the last day in
    October. Fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004 were

52-week

periods. Fiscal year 2007 is a

53-week

period.

Certain amounts reported in previous years have been
    reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2006 presentation. Such
    reclassifications were immaterial.

b.  Cash,
    Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments

Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with
    insignificant interest rate risk and maturities of three months
    or less at the time of acquisition. Cash, cash equivalents and
    short-term investments consist primarily of corporate
    obligations such as commercial paper and corporate bonds, and
    Treasury and government agency notes and bonds. They also
    include bank time deposits, institutional money market funds and
    taxable municipal bonds.

The Company classifies its investments in readily marketable
    debt and equity securities as

“held-to-maturity,”

“available-for-sale”

or “trading” at the time of purchase. There were no
    transfers between investment classifications in any of the
    fiscal years presented.

Held-to-maturity

securities, which are carried at amortized cost, include only
    those securities the Company has the positive intent and ability
    to hold to maturity. Securities, such as bank time deposits,
    which by their nature are typically held to maturity, are
    classified as such. The Company’s other readily marketable
    cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as

available-for-sale.

Available-for-sale

securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and
    losses, net of related tax, if any, reported in accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss), which is a separate component
    of shareholders’ equity. The Company’s deferred
    compensation plan investments are classified as trading (see
    Note 7). Realized gains and losses, as well as interest,
    and dividends on all securities, are included in earnings.

The Company’s short-term investments are adjusted to fair
    value at the end of each quarter. These adjustments to fair
    value are recorded as an increase or decrease in accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss). No realized gains or losses
    were recorded during any of the fiscal years presented.

There were no cash equivalents or short-term investments
    classified as trading at October 28, 2006 and

    unearned stock compensation expense associated with the
    Company’s 2001 acquisitions for which 1,462,066 shares
    of common stock were issued (valued at approximately
    $81.8 million) and unvested stock options with an intrinsic
    value of approximately $11.9 million were assumed. As a
    result, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense
    over the vesting period of approximately $0.5 million in
    fiscal 2006, $3.6 million in fiscal 2005 and
    $6.1 million in fiscal 2004.

d.  Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost

e.  Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost less
    allowances for depreciation. The straight-line method of
    depreciation is used for all classes of assets for financial
    statement purposes; both straight-line and accelerated methods
    are used for income tax purposes. Capitalized leases and
    leasehold improvements are amortized based upon the lesser of
    the term of the lease or the useful life of the asset.
    Depreciation and amortization are based on the following useful
    lives:

Buildings & building
    equipment

Up to 25 years

Machinery & equipment

3-8 years

Office equipment

3-8 years

Total depreciation of property, plant and equipment was
    $167 million, $153 million and $150 million in
    fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable.
    Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of
    their carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows the
    assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic
    lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
    impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by
    which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market
    value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a
    value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique.
    If such assets are not impaired, but their useful lives have
    decreased, the remaining net book value is amortized over the
    revised useful life.

f.  Goodwill
    and Intangible Assets

Goodwill

The Company annually evaluates goodwill for impairment as well
    as whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the
    carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Because the
    Company has one reporting segment under SFAS 142, the
    Company utilizes the entity-wide approach for assessing goodwill
    for impairment and compares its market value to its net book
    value to determine if an impairment exists. No impairment of
    goodwill resulted from the Company’s most recent evaluation
    of goodwill for impairment, which occurred in the fourth quarter
    of fiscal 2006. No impairment of goodwill resulted in any of the
    fiscal years presented. The Company’s next annual
    impairment assessment will be made in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2007 unless indicators arise that would require the
    Company to reevaluate at an earlier date. The following table
    presents the changes in goodwill during fiscal 2006 and 2005:

Intangible
    Assets

The Company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability
    of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying
    value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected
    to generate over their remaining economic lives. If such assets
    are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized
    in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the
    assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a
    quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing
    a discounted cash flow technique.

During fiscal 2006, the Company purchased certain assets from
    TTPCom Limited (TTPCom), substantially all of the shares of
    Integrant Technologies, Inc. and all of the shares of AudioAsics
    A/S (AudioAsics). See Note 6 for additional information on
    the Company’s fiscal 2006 acquisitions. As a result of
    these acquisitions, the Company recorded $43.1 million of
    intangible assets at the current exchange rate on the date of
    acquisition. The acquired intangible assets consisted of the

    their estimated useful lives, which range from five to ten
    years. The remaining amortization expense will be recognized
    over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.0 years. The
    $13.2 million of intangible assets acquired during the
    third quarter of fiscal 2006 and the $29.9 million acquired
    during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 will be amortized over
    their estimated useful lives of two to five years using an
    accelerated method of amortization that is expected to reflect
    the estimated pattern of economic use.

Amortization expense related to intangibles was
    $5.3 million, $2.4 million and $2.7 million in
    fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The Company expects annual amortization expense for these

g.  Grant
    Accounting

Certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries have received
    various grants from governmental agencies. These grants include
    capital, employment and research and development grants. Capital
    grants for the acquisition of property and equipment are netted
    against the related capital expenditures and amortized as a
    credit to depreciation expense over the useful life of the
    related asset. Employment grants, which relate to employee
    hiring and training, and research and development grants are
    recognized in earnings in the period in which the related
    expenditures are incurred by the Company.

h.  Translation
    of Foreign Currencies

The functional currency for the Company’s foreign sales and
    research and development operations is the applicable local
    currency. Gains and losses resulting from translation of these
    foreign currencies into U.S. dollars are recorded in
    accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. Transaction gains
    and losses and remeasurement of foreign currency denominated
    assets and liabilities are included in income currently,
    including those at the Company’s principal foreign
    manufacturing operations where the functional currency is the
    U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses
    included in other expenses, net, were not material in fiscal
    2006, 2005 or 2004.

i.  Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Agreements

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to
    offset certain operational and balance sheet exposures from the
    impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Such
    exposures result from the portion of the Company’s
    operations, assets and liabilities that are denominated in
    currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily Japanese
    Yen, Euro, and British Pounds Sterling. These foreign exchange
    contracts are entered into to support product sales, purchases
    and financing transactions made in the normal course of
    business, and accordingly, are not speculative in nature. In
    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 133 (SFAS 133),

Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities

, hedges related to
    anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the
    inception of the respective hedges as cash flow hedges and are
    evaluated for effectiveness monthly.

The Company records all derivative financial instruments in the
    consolidated financial statements in other current assets or
    accrued liabilities, depending on their net position, at fair
    value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the
    instrument. Changes in the fair value of the derivative
    financial instruments are either recognized periodically in
    earnings or in shareholders’ equity as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) or loss depending
    on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for
    hedge accounting as defined by SFAS 133. Changes in fair
    values of derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting are
    reported in earnings as they occur.

Foreign Exchange Exposure Management

— The
    Company has significant international sales and purchase
    transactions in foreign currencies and has a policy of hedging
    forecasted and actual foreign currency risk with forward foreign
    exchange contracts. The Company’s forward foreign exchange
    contracts are denominated in Japanese Yen, British Pounds
    Sterling and the Euro and are for periods consistent with the
    terms of the underlying transactions, generally one year or
    less. Derivative instruments are employed to eliminate or
    minimize certain foreign currency exposures that can be
    confidently identified and quantified. In accordance with
    SFAS 133, hedges related to anticipated transactions are
    designated and documented at the inception of the respective
    hedges as cash flow hedges and are evaluated for effectiveness
    monthly. As the terms of the contract and the underlying
    transaction are matched at inception, forward contract
    effectiveness is calculated by comparing the change in fair
    value of the contract to the change in the forward value of the
    anticipated transaction, with the effective portion of the gain
    or loss on the derivative instrument reported as a component of
    OCI in shareholders’ equity and reclassified into earnings
    in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects
    earnings. Any residual change in fair value of the instruments,
    or ineffectiveness, is recognized immediately in other income/
    expense. No ineffectiveness was recognized in fiscal 2006, 2005
    or 2004.

Additionally, the Company enters into forward foreign currency
    contracts that economically hedge the gains and losses generated
    by the remeasurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities
    in a non-functional currency. Changes in the fair value of these
    undesignated hedges are recognized in other income/expense
    immediately as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the
    asset or liability being hedged.

Derivative financial instruments involve, to a varying degree,
    elements of market and credit risk not recognized in the
    consolidated financial statements. The market risk associated
    with these instruments resulting from currency exchange rate or
    interest rate movements is expected to offset the market risk of
    the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being
    hedged. The counterparties to the agreements relating to the
    Company’s foreign exchange and interest rate instruments
    consist of a number of major international financial
    institutions with high credit ratings. The Company does not
    believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by
    these counterparties because the Company continually monitors
    the credit ratings of such counterparties, and limits the
    financial exposure with any one financial institution. While the
    contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments
    provide one measure of the volume of these transactions,
    they do not represent the amount of the Company’s exposure
    to credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk
    (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet
    the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the
    amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations
    under the contracts exceed the obligations of the Company to the
    counterparties.

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company
    in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial
    instruments:

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments

— These investments, except for
    those classified as

held-to-maturity,

which are carried at amortized cost, are adjusted to fair value
    based on quoted market values.

Deferred compensation plan investments and other
    investments

— The fair value of these
    investments is based on quoted market values, with the exception
    of private-company equity investments that are carried at cost,
    adjusted for impairment charges.

Interest rate swap and cap agreements

—
    The fair value of interest rate swap and cap agreements is
    obtained from dealer quotes. These values represent the
    estimated amount the Company would receive or pay to terminate
    the agreements taking into consideration current interest rates.

Forward foreign currency exchange
    contracts

— The estimated fair value of
    forward foreign currency exchange contracts, which includes
    derivatives that are accounted for as cash flow hedges and those
    that are not designated as cash flow hedges, is based on the
    estimated amount at which they could be settled based on forward
    market exchange rates.

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

k.  Use
    of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial
    statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
    during the reporting period. Such estimates relate to the useful
    lives of fixed assets and identified intangible assets,
    allowances for doubtful accounts and customer returns, the net
    realizable value of inventory, potential reserves relating to
    litigation matters, accrued liabilities, accrued taxes, deferred
    tax valuation allowances, assumptions pertaining to share-based
    payments and other reserves. Actual results could differ from
    those estimates, and such differences may be material to the
    financial statements.

l.  Concentrations
    of Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
    concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments
    and trade accounts receivable.

The Company maintains cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments and long-term investments with high credit quality
    financial institutions and monitors the amount of credit
    exposure to any one financial institution and issuer.

The Company sells its products to distributors and original
    equipment manufacturers involved in a variety of industries
    including industrial process automation, instrumentation,
    defense/aerospace, automotive, communications, computers and
    computer peripherals and consumer electronics. The Company has
    adopted credit policies and standards to accommodate growth in
    these markets. The Company performs continuing credit
    evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and
    although the Company generally does not require collateral,
    letters of credit may be required from its customers in certain
    circumstances. Reserves are provided for estimated amounts of
    accounts receivable that may not be collected.

m.  Concentration
    of Other Risks

The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid
    technological change, competitive pricing pressures and cyclical
    market patterns. The Company’s financial results are
    affected by a wide variety of factors, including general
    economic conditions worldwide, economic conditions specific to
    the semiconductor industry, the timely implementation of new
    manufacturing technologies, the ability to safeguard patents and
    intellectual property in a rapidly evolving market and reliance
    on assembly and test subcontractors, third-party wafer
    fabricators and independent distributors. In addition, the
    semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject
    to significant economic downturns at various times. The Company
    is exposed to the risk of obsolescence of its inventory
    depending on the mix of future business. Additionally, the
    Company utilizes third-party wafer fabricators as sole-source
    suppliers, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company
    for certain products. As a result, the Company may experience
    significant

period-to-period

fluctuations in future operating results due to the factors
    mentioned above or other factors.

n.  Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to
    distributors are deferred until the distributors resell the
    products to end-users. Deferred amounts are presented net and
    included as “Deferred income on shipments to
    distributors” in the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheets. Revenue from product sales to end-users is recognized
    when title passes, which for shipments to certain foreign
    countries is subsequent to product shipment. Title for these
    shipments ordinarily passes within a week of shipment. A reserve
    for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based
    on historical experience or specific identification of an event
    necessitating a reserve.

Shipping costs are charged to cost of sales as incurred.

    material.

o.  Accumulated
    Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income

Other comprehensive (loss) income includes certain transactions
    that have generally been reported in the consolidated statement
    of shareholders’ equity. Accumulated other comprehensive
    (loss) income is comprised of minimum pension liability
    adjustments, unrealized gains (losses) on

available-for-sale

securities, foreign currency translation adjustments and net
    unrealized gain (loss) on derivative instruments designated as
    cash flow hedges.

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense
    was $10.9 million in fiscal 2006, $10.5 million in
    fiscal 2005 and $11.9 million in fiscal 2004.

q.  Income
    Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
    differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets
    and liabilities and are measured using the enacted income tax
    rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the
    temporary differences are expected to reverse. Additionally,
    deferred tax assets and liabilities are separated into current
    and noncurrent amounts based on the classification of the
    related assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes.

r.  Earnings
    Per Share of Common Stock

Basic earnings per share is computed based only on the weighted
    average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
    Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted
    average number of common shares outstanding during the period,
    plus the dilutive effect of potential future issuances of common
    stock relating to stock option programs and other potentially
    dilutive securities using the treasury stock method. In
    calculating diluted earnings per share, the dilutive effect of
    stock options is computed using the average market price for the
    respective period. In addition, under SFAS 123R, the
    assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method include the
    average unrecognized compensation expense of stock options that
    are

in-the-money.

This results in the “assumed” buyback of additional
    shares, thereby reducing the dilutive impact of stock options.
    Potential shares related to certain of the Company’s
    outstanding stock options were excluded because they were
    anti-dilutive. Those potential shares, determined based on the
    weighted average exercise prices during the respective years,
    related to the Company’s outstanding stock options could be
    dilutive in the future.

s.  Stock-Based
    Compensation

On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(SFAS 123R). SFAS 123R supersedes APB Opinion
    No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

,
    and amends SFAS No. 95,

Statement of Cash
    Flows.

Generally, the approach in SFAS 123R is similar
    to the approach described in SFAS 123

Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation.

However, SFAS 123R requires
    all share-based payments to employees, including grants of
    employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement
    over their vesting period based on their fair values at the date
    of grant. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative.

On October 30, 2005 (the first day of its 2006 fiscal
    year), the Company adopted SFAS 123R using the modified
    prospective method as permitted under SFAS 123R. Under this
    transition method, compensation cost recognized in fiscal 2006
    includes: (a) compensation cost for all share-based
    payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of
    October 29, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value
    estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123,
    and (b) compensation cost for all share-based payments
    granted subsequent to October 29, 2005, based on the
    grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS 123R. In accordance with the modified
    prospective method of adoption, the Company’s results of
    operations and financial position for prior periods have not
    been restated.

See Note 3 for additional information relating to
    stock-based compensation.

t.  New
    Accounting Standards

Accounting
    for Prior Year Misstatements

In September 2006, the United States Securities and Exchange
    Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB)
    No. 108,

Considering the Effects of Prior Year
    Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
    Financial Statements

(SAB 108). This SAB provides
    guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year
    misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the
    purpose of a materiality assessment. SAB 108 establishes an
    approach that requires quantification of financial statement
    errors based on the effects of each of the company’s
    balance sheet and statement of operations financial statements
    and the related financial statement disclosures. The SAB permits
    existing public companies to record the cumulative effect of

applying this approach in the first year ending after
    November 15, 2006 by recording the necessary correcting
    adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as
    of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment
    recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings.
    Additionally, the use of the cumulative effect transition method
    requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each
    individual error being corrected through the cumulative
    adjustment and how and when it arose. The Company is currently
    evaluating the impact, if any, that SAB 108 may have on the
    Company’s financial conditions, results of operations or
    liquidity.

Accounting
    for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS)
    No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
    Pension and Other Postretirement Plans — An Amendment
    of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132R

(SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires companies to
    recognize the funded status of pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans on sponsoring employers’ balance sheets and
    to recognize changes in the funded status in the year the
    changes occur. It also requires the measurement date of plan
    assets and obligations to occur at the end of the
    employers’ fiscal year.

SFAS 158 is effective for the Company at the end of fiscal
    2007, except for the change in measurement date, which is
    effective for the Company in fiscal 2008. The effect on the
    Company’s financial statements is dependent upon the
    discount rate at the Company’s fiscal 2007 measurement date
    (September 30, 2007) and actual returns on the
    Company’s pension plan assets during the year. The Company
    is currently evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 158
    may have on the Company’s financial conditions, results of
    operations or liquidity.

Accounting
    for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(FIN 48).
    FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income
    taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in
    accordance with SFAS 109,

Accounting for Income
    Taxes.

FIN 48 prescribes a recognition
    threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
    recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected
    to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance
    on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties,
    accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.
    FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2006. The Company is currently evaluating the
    impact, if any, that FIN 48 may have on the Company’s
    financial condition results of operations or liquidity.

Accounting
    Changes and Error Corrections

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections

(SFAS 154) which supersedes APB Opinion
    No. 20,

Accounting Changes

and SFAS No. 3,

Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial
    Statements.

SFAS 154 provides guidance on the
    accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error
    corrections. It establishes, unless impracticable, retrospective
    application as the required method for reporting a change in
    accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition
    requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle.
    The correction of an error in previously issued financial
    statements is not an accounting change. However, the reporting
    of an error correction involves adjustments to previously issued
    financial statements similar to those generally applicable to
    reporting an accounting change retroactively. Therefore, the
    reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously
    issued financial statements is also addressed by this statement.
    SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and
    corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 154 in fiscal
    2006 did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Asset
    Retirements

In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
    Obligations — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 143

(FIN 47). FIN 47 clarifies that the
    term “conditional

asset retirement obligation” as used in SFAS 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

, refers to a
    legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in
    which the timing and (or) method of settlement are conditional
    on a future event that may or may not be within the control of
    the entity. The obligation to perform the asset retirement
    activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about
    the timing and (or) method of settlement. Uncertainty about the
    timing and (or) method of settlement of a conditional asset
    retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of
    the liability when sufficient information exists. FIN 47
    also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information
    to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement
    obligation. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of
    fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The adoption
    of FIN 47 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 did not
    impact the Company’s financial condition, results of
    operations or liquidity.

Inventory
    Costs

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,

Inventory Costs, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin
    (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4

(SFAS 151).
    SFAS 151 amends the guidance in ARB No. 43,
    Chapter 4, “Inventory Pricing,” to clarify that
    abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling
    costs, and wasted material (spoilage) should be recognized as
    current-period charges. In addition, SFAS 151 requires that
    allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of
    conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production
    facilities. The provisions of SFAS 151 are effective for
    fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of
    SFAS 151 in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 did not impact
    the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or
    liquidity.

Stock-Based
    Compensation and Shareholders’ Equity

On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(SFAS 123R). SFAS 123R supersedes APB Opinion
    No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

,
    and amends SFAS No. 95,

Statement of Cash
    Flows.

Generally, the approach in SFAS 123R is similar
    to the approach described in SFAS 123

Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation.

However, SFAS 123R requires
    all share-based payments to employees, including grants of
    employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement
    over their vesting period based on their fair values at the date
    of grant. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative.

On October 30, 2005 (the first day of its 2006 fiscal
    year), the Company adopted SFAS 123R using the modified
    prospective method as permitted under SFAS 123R. Under this
    transition method, compensation cost recognized in fiscal 2006
    includes: (a) compensation cost for all share-based
    payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of
    October 29, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value
    estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123,
    and (b) compensation cost for all share-based payments
    granted subsequent to October 29, 2005, based on the
    grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS 123R. In accordance with the modified
    prospective method of adoption, the Company’s results of
    operations and financial position for prior periods have not
    been restated.

Equity
    Compensation Plans

The Company grants, or has granted, stock options and other
    stock and stock-based awards under the following equity
    compensation plans:

2006 Stock Incentive Plan (2006 Plan)

— The
    2006 Plan was approved by the Company’s Board of Directors
    on January 23, 2006 and was approved by shareholders on
    March 14, 2006 and subsequently amended in March 2006. The
    2006 Plan provides for the grant of up to 15 million shares
    of the Company’s common stock, plus such number of
    additional shares that were subject to outstanding options under
    the Company’s 1998 Stock Option Plan and the 2001
    Broad-Based Stock Option Plan as of January 23, 2006 that
    are not issued because the applicable option award subsequently
    terminates or expires without being exercised. The 2006 Plan
    provides for the grant of incentive stock options intended to
    qualify under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of
    1986, as amended, or non-statutory stock options, stock
    appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units
    and other stock-based

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

awards. Employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisors
    of the Company and its subsidiaries are eligible to be granted
    awards under the 2006 Plan. No award may be made under the 2006
    Plan after March 13, 2016, but awards previously granted
    may extend beyond that date. The Company will not grant further
    options under the 1998 Plan or the 2001 Plan.

2001 Broad-Based Stock Option Plan (2001
    Plan)

— The 2001 Plan was adopted by the
    Company’s Board of Directors in December 2001 and
    subsequently amended in December 2002. The 2001 Plan provides
    for the issuance of options to purchase up to 50 million
    shares of common stock to employees, consultants or advisors of
    the Company and its subsidiaries, other than executive officers
    and directors. As a result of the approval of the 2006 Plan, no
    further grants were made under the 2001 Plan.

The 1998 Stock Option Plan (1998 Plan)

— The
    1998 Plan was approved by shareholders in fiscal 1998 and
    subsequently amended in December 2001 and December 2002. The
    1998 Plan provides for the issuance of nonstatutory and
    incentive stock options to purchase up to 30 million shares
    of common stock. In March 2000, the Company’s shareholders
    approved an amendment to the 1998 Plan to increase the shares
    reserved for issuance under the 1998 Plan by an additional
    34 million shares. As a result of the approval of the 2006
    Plan, no further grants were made under the 1998 Plan.

While the Company may grant to employees options that become
    exercisable at different times or within different periods, the
    Company has generally granted to employees options that vest
    over five years and become exercisable in annual installments of


/


%
    on each of the third, fourth, and fifth anniversaries of the
    date of grant; in annual installments of 25% on each of the
    second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of
    grant; or 20% on each of the first, second, third, fourth and
    fifth anniversaries of the date of grant. The maximum
    contractual term of all options is ten years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plans

— The Company
    also has employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs) that allow
    eligible employees to purchase, through payroll deductions,
    shares of the Company’s common stock at 85% of the fair
    market value at specified dates. Employees may withdraw from an
    offering before the purchase date and obtain a refund of the
    amounts withheld through payroll deductions plus accrued
    interest. The latest offering period began June 1, 2005 and
    ended on June 1, 2006; therefore, June 1, 2005 is
    considered the grant date for the purposes of recognizing the
    stock-based compensation expense for that offering period.
    During fiscal 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors
    decided that the latest offering period, which ended
    June 1, 2006, would be the last offering period under the
    ESPPs. Under APB Opinion No. 25, the Company was not
    required to recognize stock-based compensation expense for the
    cost of stock options or shares issued under the Company’s
    ESPPs. Upon adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company began
    recording stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPPs.

Expected volatility — The Company is responsible for
    estimating volatility and has considered a number of factors,
    including third-party estimates, when estimating volatility. For
    options granted prior to fiscal 2005, the Company used
    historical volatility to estimate the grant-date fair value of
    stock options. The Company changed its method of estimating
    expected volatility for all stock options granted after fiscal
    2004 from exclusively relying on historical volatility to
    exclusively relying on implied volatility. This change was the
    result of a thorough review the Company undertook, which
    included consultations with several third-party advisors. The
    Company currently believes that the exclusive use of implied
    volatility results in a more accurate estimate of the grant-date
    fair value of employee stock options because it more
    appropriately reflects the market’s current expectations of
    future volatility. Historical volatility during the period
    commensurate with the expected term of the Company’s stock
    options over the past several years included a period of time
    when the Company’s stock price experienced unprecedented
    increases and subsequent declines. The Company believes that
    this past stock price volatility is unlikely to be indicative of
    future stock price behavior. Options in the Company’s
    common stock are actively traded on several exchanges. Implied
    volatility is calculated for the period that is commensurate
    with the option’s expected term assumption. Because this
    term often exceeds the period for which there are
    exchange-traded options in the Company’s common stock,
    statistical techniques are used to derive the implied volatility
    for traded options with terms commensurate with the
    option’s expected term of five years. This calculation of
    implied volatility is derived from the closing prices of both
    the Company’s common stock and exchange traded options from
    the most recent five trading days prior to the grant date of the
    employee stock option.

Expected term — The Company uses historical employee
    exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected
    term assumption for the Black-Scholes grant-date valuation. The
    Company believes that this historical data is currently the best
    estimate of the expected term of a new option, and that
    generally its employees exhibit similar exercise behavior.

Risk-free interest rate — The yield on zero-coupon
    U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate
    with the expected term assumption is used as the risk-free
    interest rate.

Expected dividend yield — Expected dividend yield is
    calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by the
    Company’s Board of Directors for the current quarter and
    dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of
    grant. Until such time as the Company’s Board of Directors
    declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from
    the current quarter’s cash dividend, the current dividend
    will be used in deriving this assumption. Cash dividends are not
    paid on options, restricted stock or restricted stock units.

Stock-based
    Compensation Expense

The Company used the graded attribution method to recognize
    expense for all stock-based awards prior to the adoption of
    SFAS 123R. Upon adoption of SFAS 123R on
    October 30, 2005, the Company changed to the straight-line
    attribution method to recognize expense for stock-based awards
    granted after October 29, 2005. The change to the
    straight-line attribution method was made so that the expense
    associated with each stock-based award is recognized evenly over
    the vesting period. The expense associated with the unvested
    portion of the pre-adoption grants will continue to be expensed
    using the graded attribution method.

The amount of stock-based compensation recognized during a
    period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that
    are ultimately expected to vest. SFAS 123R requires
    forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if
    necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ
    from those estimates. The term “forfeitures” is
    distinct from “cancellations” or
    “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion
    of the surrendered stock-based award. The Company currently
    expects, based on an analysis of its historical forfeitures,
    that approximately 84% of its stock-based awards will vest, and
    therefore has applied an annual forfeiture rate of 3.4% to all
    unvested stock-based awards as of October 28, 2006. The
    3.4% represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited
    each year over the vesting period; therefore, the cumulative
    amount, on a compounded basis, that is expected to be forfeited
    is approximately 16% of the aggregate stock-based awards. This
    analysis will be re-evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate
    will be adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the actual expense
    recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares
    that vest.

The Company’s stock option agreements historically provided
    for retirement-related continued vesting for a portion, or all,
    of certain stock options based on the optionee’s age and
    years of service (the retirement provision) in that regardless
    of whether the employee continues to provide services, the
    optionee receives the benefit of the stock option.
    SFAS 123R clarifies the timing for recognizing stock-based
    compensation expense for awards subject to continued vesting
    upon meeting this retirement provision. This compensation
    expense must be recognized over the period from the date of
    grant to the date retirement eligibility is met if it is shorter
    than the required service period. Upon adoption of
    SFAS 123R in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company
    changed its policy regarding the timing of option expense
    recognition for optionees meeting the criteria of the retirement
    provision to recognize compensation cost over the period through
    the date that the optionee is no longer required to provide
    service to earn the award. Prior to the adoption of
    SFAS 123R, the Company’s policy was to recognize these
    compensation costs over the vesting term. Had the Company
    applied these non-substantive vesting provisions required by
    SFAS 123R to awards granted prior to the adoption of
    SFAS 123R, the impact on the pro forma net earnings
    presented below would have been immaterial. Effective during the
    third fiscal quarter of fiscal 2006, new grants will not include
    a provision that provides for retirement-related continued
    vesting.

The adoption of SFAS 123R on October 30, 2005 had the
    following impact on fiscal 2006 results: operating profit before
    tax was lower by $73.9 million, net income was lower by
    $52.6 million, cash flow from operations was lower by
    $181.2 million, cash flow from financing activities was
    higher by $181.2 million and basic and diluted EPS were
    lower by $0.15 and $0.14, respectively.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, on October 18,
    2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of all unvested stock
    options awarded to employees after December 31, 2000 that
    had exercise prices of $40.00 per share or greater. Options
    issued to its corporate officers and directors were not
    accelerated. Unvested options to purchase approximately
    18 million shares became exercisable as a result of the
    vesting acceleration. Because the exercise price of all the
    modified options was greater than the market price of the
    Company’s underlying common stock on the date of the
    modification, no stock-based compensation expense was recorded
    in the statement of income, in accordance with APB Opinion
    No. 25. The primary purpose for modifying the terms of
    these

out-of-the-money

stock options to accelerate their vesting was to eliminate the
    need to recognize the remaining unrecognized non-cash
    compensation expense in the statement of income associated with
    these options as measured under SFAS 123, because the
    approximately $188 million ($134 million net of tax)
    of future expense associated with these options would have been
    disproportionately high compared to the economic value of the
    options at the date of modification.

As disclosed in Note 13, on November 15, 2005, the
    Company announced that it reached a tentative settlement with
    the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, of the
    SEC’s previously announced investigation into certain
    option grants made by the Company. The Company has determined
    that no restatement of its historical financial results would be
    necessary due to the proposed settlement because the effects of
    using revised measurement dates for options granted in 1998,
    1999 and 2001 are not material to any of the fiscal years 1998
    through 2005, based on the materiality guidelines contained in
    Staff Accounting Bulletin 99,

Materiality

(SAB 99). Accordingly, the table presented above has
    not been restated to reflect the effects of using the revised
    measurement dates.

In addition to the vested options, the Company expects a portion

    Options expected to vest is calculated by applying an estimated
    forfeiture rate to the unvested options.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised (i.e. the

The 2006 Plan provides that for purposes of determining the
    number of shares available for issuance under the 2006 Plan, any
    restricted stock award, restricted stock unit or other
    stock-based award with a per share or per unit price lower than
    the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant
    (a “Full-Value Award”) will be counted as three shares
    for each share subject to the Full-Value Award.

As of October 28, 2006, a total of 102,486,091 common
    shares were reserved for issuance under the Company’s stock
    plans.

Common
    Stock Repurchase

In August 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors approved
    the repurchase of up to $500 million of the Company’s
    common stock. On May 11, 2005, the Company’s Board of
    Directors amended the stock repurchase program by increasing the
    total amount of the Company’s common stock the Company is
    authorized to repurchase from $500 million to
    $1 billion of common stock. On March 14, 2006, the
    Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by the Company of
    an additional $1 billion of the Company’s common
    stock, increasing the total amount of the Company’s common
    stock the Company can repurchase from $1 billion to
    $2 billion of the Company’s common stock. Under the
    repurchase program, the Company may repurchase outstanding
    shares of its common stock from time to time in the open market
    and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated
    earlier by resolution of the Company’s Board of Directors,
    the repurchase program will expire when the Company has
    repurchased all shares authorized under the program. The Company
    repurchased a total of 30.7 million shares for
    approximately $1,025 million during fiscal 2006. As of
    October 28, 2006, the Company had repurchased



ANALOG
    DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

approximately 49 million shares of its common stock for
    approximately $1,688 million under this program. The
    repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of
    common stock.

Preferred
    Stock

The Company has 471,934 authorized shares of $1.00 par
    value preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding.
    The Board of Directors is authorized to fix designations,
    relative rights, preferences and limitations on the preferred
    stock at the time of issuance.

Common
    Stock Purchase Rights

In March 1998, the Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder
    Rights Plan (the Stockholder Rights Plan) that replaced a plan
    adopted by the Board in 1988. Pursuant to the Stockholder Rights
    Plan, after giving effect to the Company’s

two-for-one

stock split effected on March 15, 2000, each share of the
    Company’s common stock had an associated one-half of a
    right. Under certain circumstances, each whole right would have
    entitled the registered holder to purchase from the Company one
    one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating
    Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $180 in cash, subject to
    adjustment.

On January 23, 2006, the Company, by vote of its Board of
    Directors, terminated its Stockholder Rights Plan. All rights
    outstanding under the Stockholder Rights Plan were redeemed at a
    redemption price of $0.0005 per right (as adjusted to
    reflect the

two-for-one

split of the Company’s common stock on March 15, 2000)
    (as adjusted, the “Redemption Price”) and paid on
    March 15, 2006 to the holders of record of the
    Company’s common stock on February 24, 2006. All
    rights to exercise rights issued under the Stockholder Rights
    Plan terminated on January 23, 2006 and the only right
    thereafter of the holders of rights issued under the Stockholder
    Rights Plan was to receive the Redemption Price.

Closure
    of Wafer Fabrication Facility

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company recorded a
    special charge of $20.3 million as a result of a decision
    to close its California wafer fabrication operations and
    transfer virtually all of the production of products
    manufactured there to the Company’s facility located in
    Wilmington, Massachusetts. The charge was for severance and
    fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to
    SFAS 88,

Employers’ Accounting for Settlements and
    Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for
    Termination Benefits

, under the Company’s ongoing
    benefit plan for 339 manufacturing employees and 28 general
    and administrative employees at that site. The severance benefit
    is calculated based on length of past service, and employees
    must continue to be employed until they are involuntarily
    terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. As of
    October 28, 2006, 72 of these employees remained employed
    at the Company. The employment of 42 of these employees was
    terminated on November 9, 2006. The remaining 30 employees
    will continue working over the next three months on the cleanup
    and closure of the wafer fabrication facility.

In addition to the charge recorded in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2005, the Company recorded additional expense during
    fiscal 2006, which consisted of $18.3 million of non-cash
    cost of sales expenses for additional depreciation due to
    shortened useful lives of certain manufacturing equipment and
    $2.0 million for stay-on bonuses. The Company reversed
    approximately $2.0 million of its severance accrual during
    fiscal 2006. The accrual reversal was required because some
    employees voluntarily left the Company, other employees found
    alternative employment within the Company, and there was an over
    accrual related to fringe benefits because severance payments,
    normally paid as income continuance, were paid as lump sum
    payments which reduced the benefit costs associated with these
    terminated employees.

The Company completed production at the wafer fabrication
    facility on November 9, 2006. The Company expects to incur
    additional expense related to this action in the first half of
    fiscal 2007 of approximately $11 million for lease
    termination, cleanup and closure costs. In accordance with
    SFAS 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
    Disposal Activities

, the lease charge will be taken when the
    Company ceases using the building and the cleanup and closure
    costs will be expensed as incurred.

Reorganization
    of Product Development and Support Programs

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company recorded a
    special charge of $11.2 million as a result of its decision
    to reorganize its product development and support programs with
    the goal of providing greater focus on its analog and DSP
    product programs. The charge was for severance and fringe
    benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to SFAS 88,

Employers’ Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments
    of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination
    Benefits

, under the Company’s ongoing benefit plan or
    statutory requirements at foreign locations for 60 manufacturing
    employees and 154 engineering and selling, marketing, general
    and administrative employees. These employees must continue to
    be employed until they are involuntarily terminated in order to
    receive the severance benefit. As of October 28, 2006, 23
    of these employees were still employed by the Company.



ANALOG
    DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During fiscal 2006, the Company recorded an additional special
    charge of $3.8 million related to this reorganization
    action. Approximately $1.5 million of this charge was for
    lease obligation costs for a facility the Company ceased using
    during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and the write-off of
    property, plant and equipment and other items at this
    subsidiary. The remaining $2.3 million relates to the
    severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded in the
    fourth quarter pursuant to SFAS 88,

Employers’
    Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit
    Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits

, under the
    Company’s ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at
    foreign locations for 46 engineering and selling, marketing,
    general and administrative employees. These employees must
    continue to be employed until they are involuntarily terminated
    in order to receive the severance benefit. As of
    October 28, 2006, 35 of these employees were still employed
    by the Company.

Acquisitions

In the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company completed a
    transaction with TTPCom Limited (TTPCom), whereby TTPCom
    transferred to the Company intellectual property, engineering
    resources, and related assets associated with the support and
    customization of TTPCom’s GSM/GPRS/EDGE modem software for
    use on the Company’s existing and future generations of
    SoftFone

®

baseband processors. The Company also acquired development
    rights for AJAR, TTPCom’s advanced applications platform.
    As a result of this transaction, the Company is the single point
    of contact for both hardware and software support for its new
    and existing wireless handset customers, thus improving the
    Company’s abilities to service the needs of individual
    customers. The Company paid $11.9 million in initial cash
    payments and may become obligated to make additional cash
    payments of up to an aggregate of $12 million based on the
    achievement of technological milestoned during the period from
    May 2006 through November 2006. The purchase price was allocated
    to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their
    estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The estimated
    fair values of the assets exceeded the initial payments by
    $7.8 million, resulting in negative goodwill. Pursuant to
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141,

Business Combinations

, the Company recorded a liability
    for the contingent consideration that will be accounted for as
    additional purchase price, up to the amount of the negative
    goodwill. As contingent payments become due, the payments will
    be applied against the contingent liability. Contingent payments
    in excess of $7.8 million, if any, will be recorded as
    additional purchase price. As of October 28, 2006, the
    Company had paid $6 million of contingent payments, and the
    remaining contingent liability was $1.8 million. The
    purchase price included $5.5 million of in-process
    technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility,
    had no alternative future use and was charged to operations
    during the third quarter of fiscal 2006. The in-process
    technology related to software code developed for use in the
    Company’s semiconductor chipsets manufactured for devices
    that use both the 2G and 2.5G cellular wireless technology
    standards. The fair value of the in-process technology was
    determined by a third party using the income forecast method,
    which is a discounted net cash flow approach. At the time of the
    acquisition, the in-process technology was approximately 56%
    complete. As of October 28, 2006, the in-process research
    and development projects are on schedule. The Company expects to
    complete these projects in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 and
    incur an additional $1.3 million of expense related to
    these projects. The acquisition also included $13.2 million
    of intangible assets (see Note 2f) that will be amortized
    over their estimated useful lives of five years using an
    accelerated amortization method that reflects the estimated
    pattern of economic use.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company acquired
    substantially all the outstanding stock of privately-held
    Integrant Technologies, Inc. (Integrant) of Seoul, Korea. The
    acquisition enabled the Company to enter the mobile TV market as
    well as strengthened its presence in the Asian region. The
    Company paid $127.2 million in initial cash payments at
    closing and may be obligated to make additional cash payments of
    up to an aggregate of $33 million upon the satisfaction of
    certain conditions. The initial cash payments include
    $4.2 million held in escrow for the purchase of the
    remaining non-founder outstanding shares. The preliminary
    purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible
    assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date
    of acquisition. The Company expects to complete the purchase
    accounting in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 upon obtaining
    certain additional information. The $33 million of
    potential cash payments is comprised of $25 million for the
    achievement

of revenue-based milestones that may be payable during the
    period from July 2006 through December 2007 and $8 million
    related to the purchase of shares from the founder of Integrant
    during the period from July 2007 through July 2009. The
    additional cash payments, if any, will be recorded as additional
    purchase price. The purchase price included $11.1 million
    of in-process technology that had not yet reached technological
    feasibility, had no alternative future use and was charged to
    operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The
    in-process technology related to technologies currently in
    development for Dual DAB, T-DMB, DVB-H, RFID and WiBro
    applications. The fair value of the in-process technology was
    determined by a third party using the income forecast method,
    which is a discounted net cash flow approach. At the time of the
    acquisition, the in-process technology was approximately 74%
    complete. As of October 28, 2006, the in-process research
    and development projects are on schedule. The Company expects to
    complete these projects in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 and
    incur an additional $3.3 million of expense related to
    these projects. The acquisition also included $21.6 million
    of intangible assets (see Note 2f) that will be amortized
    over their estimated useful lives of two to five years using an
    accelerated amortization method that reflects the estimated
    pattern of economic use.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company acquired all
    the outstanding stock of privately-held AudioAsics A/S
    (AudioAsics) of Roskilde, Denmark. The acquisition of AudioAsics
    allows the Company to continue developing low-power audio
    solutions, while expanding its presence in the Nordic and
    Eastern European regions. The Company paid $19.3 million in
    initial cash payments at closing and may be obligated to make
    additional cash payments of up to an aggregate of
    $8 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The
    purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible
    assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date
    of acquisition. The $8 million of potential cash payments
    is comprised $4.8 million for the achievement of
    revenue-based milestones that may be payable during the period
    from October 2006 through January 2009 and $3.2 million
    based on the achievement of certain technological milestones
    during the period from October 2006 through January 2009. In
    order to be entitled to receive $2.4 million of the
    revenue-based contingent consideration, certain key employees
    must continue to be employed by the Company. As such, that
    portion of the revenue-based contingent consideration will be
    recorded as compensation expense when, and if, it is earned. The
    technological milestones require post-acquisition services to be
    rendered in order to be achieved and, as such, will be recorded
    as compensation expense when earned. The purchase price included
    $5.1 million of in-process technology that had not yet
    reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use
    and was charged to operations during the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2006. The in-process technology related to technologies
    currently in development for analog and digital microphone

pre-amplifiers.

The fair value of the in-process technology was determined by a
    third party using the income forecast method, which is a
    discounted net cash flow approach. At the time of the
    acquisition, the in-process technology was approximately 69%
    complete. As of October 28, 2006, the in-process research
    and development projects are on schedule. The Company expects to
    complete these projects by April 2007 and incur an additional
    $1.0 million of expense related to these projects The
    acquisition also included $8.3 million of intangible assets
    (see Note 2f) that will be amortized over their estimated
    useful lives of five years using an accelerated amortization
    method that reflects the estimated pattern of economic use.

Pro forma results of operations for TTPCom, Integrant and
    AudioAsics have not been provided herein as they were not
    material to the Company on either an individual or an aggregate
    basis. The results of operations of each acquisition are
    included in the Company’s consolidated statement of income
    from the date of such acquisition.

    2005, respectively. Adjustments to fair value of, and income
    pertaining to, deferred compensation plan investments are
    recorded in operating expenses. Gross realized and unrealized
    gains and losses from trading securities were not material in
    fiscal 2006, 2005 or 2004.

Investments are offset by a corresponding liability to the plan
    participants (see Note 11). These investments are
    specifically designated as available to the Company solely for
    the purpose of paying benefits under the Company’s deferred
    compensation plan. However, in the event the Company became
    insolvent, the investments would be available to all unsecured
    general creditors.

During fiscal 2006, the Company distributed $254.1 million
    from its amended and restated deferred compensation plan, or the
    Deferred Compensation Plan, as a result of participant
    terminations or at the direction of the participants. This
    amount represented compensation

and/or

stock
    option gains previously deferred by those participants pursuant
    to the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan and earnings on
    those deferred amounts. As a result of certain provisions of the
    American Jobs Creation Act, participants had the opportunity
    until December 31, 2005 to elect to withdraw amounts
    previously deferred.

Deferred
    Compensation Plan Liability and Other Noncurrent
    Liabilities

The deferred compensation plan liability relates to obligations
    due under the Analog Devices, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan
    (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”). The Deferred
    Compensation Plan allows certain members of management and other
    highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer
    receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. Prior to
    January 1, 2005, participants could also defer gains on
    stock options and restricted stock granted before July 23,
    1997. The balance represents Deferred Compensation Plan
    participant accumulated deferrals, and earnings thereon, since
    the inception of the Deferred Compensation Plan, net of
    withdrawals. The total expense to the Company of the Deferred
    Compensation Plan was $1.0 million in fiscal 2006,
    $9.9 million in fiscal 2005 and $15.9 million in
    fiscal 2004. The Company’s liability under the Deferred
    Compensation Plan is an unsecured general obligation of the
    Company. Other noncurrent liabilities primarily relate to
    pension liabilities.

During fiscal 2006, the Company distributed $254.1 million
    from our amended and restated deferred compensation plan, or the
    Deferred Compensation Plan, as a result of participant
    terminations or at the direction of the participants. This
    amount represented compensation

and/or

stock
    option gains previously deferred by those participants pursuant
    to the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan and earnings on
    those deferred amounts. As a result of certain provisions of the
    American Jobs Creation Act, participants had the opportunity
    until December 31, 2005 to elect to withdraw amounts
    previously deferred.

The Company leases certain of its facilities, equipment and

    taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. Total rental expense
    under operating leases was approximately $46 million in
    fiscal 2006, $45 million in fiscal 2005 and
    $43 million in fiscal 2004.

Tentative
    Settlement of the SEC’s Previously Announced Stock Option
    Investigation

In the Company’s

Form 10-K

filing dated November 30, 2004, the Company disclosed that
    the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had initiated an
    inquiry into its stock option granting practices, focusing on
    options that were granted shortly before the issuance of
    favorable financial results. On November 15, 2005, the
    Company announced that it had reached a tentative settlement
    with the SEC.

Since receiving notice of this inquiry, the Company has
    cooperated with the SEC. The Company and its President and CEO,
    Mr. Jerald G. Fishman, have made an offer of settlement to
    the Staff of the SEC, which is subject to agreement regarding
    the specific language of the SEC’s administrative order and
    other settlement documents. The SEC Staff has decided to
    recommend the offer of settlement to the Commission. A final
    settlement is subject to review and approval by the Commission.

The contemplated settlement addresses two separate issues. The
    first issue concerns the Company’s disclosure regarding
    grants of options to employees and directors prior to the
    release of favorable financial results. Specifically, the issue
    relates to options granted to employees

(

including
    officers

)

of the Company on November 30, 1999 and to
    employees

(

including officers

)

and directors of
    the Company on November 10, 2000. The SEC settlement would
    conclude that the Company should have made disclosures in its
    proxy filings to the effect that the Company priced these stock
    options prior to releasing favorable financial results.

The second issue addressed by the tentative settlement concerns
    the grant dates for options granted to employees

(

including officers

)

in 1998 and 1999, and the
    grant date for options granted to employees (including
    officers

)

and directors in 2001. Specifically, the
    settlement would conclude that the appropriate grant date for
    the September 4, 1998 options should have been
    September 8th (which is one trading day later than the
    date that was used to price the options); the appropriate grant
    date for the November 30, 1999 options should have been
    November 29th (which is one trading day earlier than
    the date that was used); and the appropriate grant date for the
    July 18, 2001 options should have been
    July 26th (which is five trading days after the
    original date).

In connection with the contemplated settlement, the Company
    would consent to a

cease-and-desist

order under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act
    and

Rule 10b-5

thereunder, would pay a civil money penalty of $3 million,
    and would reprice options granted to Mr. Fishman and other
    directors in certain years. Options granted to all other
    employees would be excluded from the repricing. Mr. Fishman
    would consent to a

cease-and-desist

order under Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the
    Securities Act, would pay a civil money penalty of
    $1 million, and would make a disgorgement payment with
    respect to options granted in certain years. With the exception
    of options granted in 1998, Mr. Fishman has not exercised
    or sold any of the options identified in this matter. The
    Company and Mr. Fishman would settle this matter without
    admitting or denying the Commission’s findings.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company has determined that no restatement of its historical
    financial results would be necessary due to the proposed
    settlement, because the effects of using revised measurement
    dates for options granted in 1998, 1999 and 2001 are not
    material to any of the fiscal years 1998 through 2005, based on
    the materiality guidelines contained in SAB 99. If a
    stock-based compensation charge had been taken as a result of
    the revised measurement dates for these option grants to all
    employees (including officers) and directors, the net income of
    the Company for fiscal years 1998 through 2005 would have been
    reduced by $21.8 million in total. During this period, the
    Company earned cumulative net income of over $2.5 billion.
    There would be no impact on revenue, cash flow from operations,
    or shareholders’ equity as a result of using the revised
    measurement dates. The impact on net income in individual fiscal
    years would have been as follows: fiscal 1998
    ($0.2 million), fiscal 1999 ($1.4 million), fiscal
    2000 ($1.8 million), fiscal 2001 ($3.7 million),
    fiscal 2002 ($8.1 million), fiscal 2003
    ($6.1 million), fiscal 2004 ($0.5 million).

Other
    Legal Proceedings

On November 6, 2003, Enron Corporation commenced a
    proceeding in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
    Southern District of New York. On December 1, 2003, Enron
    filed an amended complaint to add the Company as a defendant in
    such proceeding. The amended complaint alleged that transfers
    made by Enron in satisfaction of obligations it had under
    commercial paper were recoverable as preferential transfers and
    fraudulent transfers and subject to avoidance under the United
    States Bankruptcy Code. It was alleged that payments made in
    premature satisfaction of obligations under commercial paper
    totaling approximately $20 million were recoverable from
    J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc., Fleet Capital Markets, Fleet
    National Bank

and/or

the
    Company. The Company sold $20 million of Enron commercial
    paper to Fleet and did not enter into any direct transactions
    with Enron. The Company has reached a settlement with Enron,
    pursuant to which the Company contributed $2.3 million
    towards a settlement of claims brought by Enron against both the
    Company and Bank of America (as successor to Fleet Capital
    Markets and Fleet National Bank). The settlement was submitted
    to and approved by the Bankruptcy Court. In accordance with the
    terms of the settlement, a stipulation of dismissal of all
    claims against the Company with prejudice has been executed by
    Enron, Bank of America and the Company and was filed with the
    Bankruptcy Court on November 9, 2006. The Bankruptcy Court
    entered the stipulation of dismissal on November 13, 2006.

On June 14, 2005, Biax Corporation filed its first amended
    complaint for patent infringement in the United States
    District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the
    Company and Intel Corporation, alleging that the Company
    infringed three patents owned by Biax relating to parallel
    processors. Prior to the filing of the first amended complaint,
    the Company was unaware of Biax or this action. The first
    amended complaint seeks injunctive relief, unspecified damages
    with interest, as well as Biax’s costs, expenses and fees.
    On August 3, 2005, the Company filed an answer and
    counterclaimed against Biax. In the counterclaim, the Company
    seeks rulings that the patents are not infringed, the patents
    are invalid and the patents are unenforceable. On
    November 7, 2005, Biax filed a second amended complaint
    alleging that the Company infringed two additional patents. The
    case is currently in the discovery phase. The Company intends to
    vigorously defend against these allegations. The Company is
    unable at this time to predict the outcome of this litigation;
    however, the Company believes that the final disposition of this
    matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company or
    its financial position.

On or about May 5, 2006, Mr. Gregory Bender filed a
    complaint for patent infringement in the U.S. District
    Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the Company.
    Prior to the filing of the complaint, the Company was unaware of
    Mr. Bender or this action. In his complaint,
    Mr. Bender alleges that certain of the Company’s
    amplifier products infringe a patent Mr. Bender owns. He
    seeks unspecified damages as well as a permanent injunction
    enjoining the Company from infringing his patent.
    Mr. Bender has served his complaint on the Company and the
    Company has filed an answer. The Company intends to vigorously
    defend against these allegations. The Company cannot predict the
    outcome of this matter, but believes that the disposition of the
    matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company or
    its financial position.

In May 2006, the Company received a demand from a purported
    shareholder with respect to certain grants of options made to
    directors and officers of the Company during the years 1998,
    1999 and 2001. That demand seeks, among other things

,

the
    commencement of an action by the directors of the Company on
    behalf of the Company against those directors and officers for
    breach of fiduciary duties arising from the granting of the
    options. A special committee of the Board of Directors of the
    Company was formed to review the allegations contained in the
    demand and to respond appropriately. After reviewing the facts
    underlying the allegations, the special committee decided to
    reject the purported shareholder’s demand. The Company does
    not know whether the purported shareholder will take further
    action.

In May 2006, the Company received a document subpoena from the
    U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York
    requesting records from 2000 to the present relating to the
    Company’s granting of stock options. The Company believes
    that the options at issue in this matter are the same option
    grants which have been the subject of investigation by the SEC.
    The Company is cooperating with the office of the
    U.S. Attorney in connection with this subpoena. The Company
    cannot predict the outcome of this matter, but believes the
    disposition of the matter will not have a material adverse
    effect on the Company or its financial position.

On June 12, 2006, a purported derivative complaint was
    filed in the United States District Court for the District of
    Massachusetts naming the Company as nominal defendant and also
    naming as defendants certain officers and directors of the
    Company. The complaint alleged purported violations of state and
    federal law in connection with the Company’s option
    granting practices during the years 1998, 1999 and 2001,
    including violation of Section 14(a) of the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, breaches of fiduciary duties of care,
    loyalty and good faith, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate
    assets, and unjust enrichment. The complaint sought monetary
    damages in unspecified amounts, as well as equitable and
    injunctive relief. On October 12, 2006, the United States
    District Court for the District of Massachusetts dismissed the
    plaintiff’s complaint with prejudice and without leave to
    amend. The Company does not know whether the plaintiff will
    appeal the court’s decision or otherwise pursue the action
    further.

In August 2006, the Company received a demand from a purported
    shareholder to inspect the Company’s books and records
    relating to certain grants of options made to directors and
    officers of the Company at diverse times. On September 8,
    2006, the Company responded to the letter and indicated that the
    purported shareholder was not entitled to the documents sought
    in the demand. The Company does not know whether the purported
    shareholder will take further action.

On October 13, 2006, a purported class action complaint was
    filed in the United States District Court for the District of
    Massachusetts on behalf of participants in the Company’s
    Investment Partnership Plan from October 5, 2000 to the
    present. The complaint named as defendants the Company, certain
    officers and directors, and the Company’s Investment
    Partnership Plan Administration Committee. The complaint alleges
    purported violations of federal law in connection with the
    Company’s option granting practices during the years 1998,
    1999, 2000, and 2001, including breaches of fiduciary duties
    owed to participants and beneficiaries of the Company’s
    Investment Partnership Plan under the Employee Retirement Income
    Security Act. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages,
    as well as equitable and injunctive relief. The Company intends
    to vigorously defend against these allegations. Although the
    Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the asserted
    claims, it is unable at this time to predict the outcome of this
    proceeding.

From time to time as a normal incidence of the nature of the
    Company’s business, various claims, charges and litigation
    are asserted or commenced against the Company arising from, or
    related to, contractual matters, patents, trademarks, personal
    injury, environmental matters, product liability, insurance
    coverage and personnel and employment disputes. As to such
    claims and litigation the Company can give no assurance that it
    will prevail.

While the Company does not believe that any of the matters
    described above will have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial position, an adverse outcome of any of
    these matters is possible and could have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations
    or cash flows in the quarter or annual period in which one or
    more of these matters are resolved.

Retirement
    Plans

The Company and its subsidiaries have various savings and
    retirement plans covering substantially all employees. The
    Company maintains a defined contribution plan for the benefit of
    its eligible United States employees. This plan provides for
    Company contributions of up to 5% of each participant’s
    total eligible compensation. In addition, the Company
    contributes an amount equal to each participant’s pre-tax
    contribution, if any, up to a maximum of 3% of each
    participant’s total eligible compensation. The total
    expense related to the defined contribution plan for
    U.S. employees was $23.3 million in fiscal 2006,
    $22.8 million in fiscal 2005 and $22.1 million in
    fiscal 2004. The Company also has various defined benefit
    pension and other retirement plans for certain

non-U.S. employees

that are consistent with local statutory requirements and
    practices. The total expense related to the various defined
    benefit pension and other retirement plans for certain

$24.2 million respectively, at September 30, 2006 and

    respectively, at September 30, 2005.

The range of assumptions used for the

The expected long-term rate of return on assets is a weighted
    average of the long-term rates of return selected for the
    various countries where the Company has funded pension plans.
    The expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption is
    selected based on the facts and circumstances that exist as of
    the measurement date, and the specific portfolio mix of plan
    assets. Management, in conjunction with its actuaries, reviewed
    anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset
    categories and considered the asset allocation strategy adopted
    by the Company and or the trustees of the plans. While the
    review considered recent fund performance and historical
    returns, the assumption is primarily a long-term, prospective
    rate.

The fundamental goal underlying the pension plans’
    investment policy is to achieve a total rate of return that
    exceeds inflation over the long-term by using a certain mix of
    assets depending on the profile of the specific plan. Investment
    practices must comply with applicable laws and regulations.

The Company’s investment strategy is based on an
    expectation that equity securities will outperform debt
    securities over the long term. Accordingly, in order to maximize
    the return on assets, a majority of assets are invested in
    equities. Investments within each asset class are diversified to
    reduce the impact of losses in single investments. The use of
    derivative instruments is permitted where appropriate and
    necessary to achieve overall investment policy objectives and
    asset class targets.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

On October 22, 2004, the U.S. enacted the American
    Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (“AJCA”). The AJCA created a
    temporary incentive for U.S. multinational corporations to
    repatriate accumulated foreign income by providing an 85%
    dividends received deduction for certain dividends from
    controlled foreign corporations. The Company decided to
    repatriate $1,055 million in extraordinary dividends, as
    defined by the AJCA, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005
    and accordingly recorded a tax liability of $48.7 million
    at October 29, 2005.

The Company continues to intend to reinvest certain of its
    foreign earnings indefinitely. Accordingly, no US income taxes
    have been provided for approximately $946 million of
    unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries. As of
    October 28, 2006, the amount of unrecognized deferred tax
    liability on these earnings was $258 million.

The significant components of the Company’s deferred tax
    assets and liabilities for the fiscal years ended
    October 28, 2006 and October 29, 2005 are as follows:

The valuation allowances of $42.6 million and
    $42.2 million at October 28, 2006 and October 29,
    2005, are a full valuation allowance for the Company’s
    state credit carryovers that will begin to expire in 2007.

The Company has provided for potential liabilities due in
    various jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining the
    worldwide income tax expense provision. In the ordinary course
    of global business, there are many transactions and calculations
    where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these
    uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement
    arrangements among related entities. Although the Company
    believes its estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given
    that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be
    different than that which is reflected in the historical income
    tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a
    material impact on the Company’s income tax provision and
    operating results in the period in which such determination is
    made.

The United States Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) has
    completed its examination of fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003
    and issued their report. The Company has agreed to accept this
    report and will file its 2006 tax return and



has filed its 2005 tax return and an amended return for 2004
    conforming to the methodologies agreed to during the

2001-2003

examination. The completion of this examination, including the
    reversal of accruals for taxes and penalties and the filing of
    refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the
    completion of the IRS examination, resulted in an income tax
    benefit of $35.2 million in fiscal year 2006.

The Company’s income tax payable decreased by
    $111 million during fiscal year 2006, which was primarily
    the result of tax deductions for stock options exercised over a
    period of several years becoming available for utilization upon
    completion of the IRS examination.

The Company’s income tax payable at October 28, 2006
    was approximately $61 million, which included approximately
    $56 million for current U.S. federal, state and
    foreign tax filings. The remaining $5 million of income tax
    payable is for various other income taxes.

During fiscal year 2006, the IRS invited the Company to
    participate in the Compliance Assurance Process (CAP) which is a
    voluntary pilot program the IRS is conducting for a limited
    number of large business taxpayers. The objective of CAP is to
    reduce taxpayer burden associated with IRS audits while assuring
    the IRS of the accuracy of tax returns prior to filing. The
    Company has agreed to participate in CAP. Under the program, the
    IRS will contemporaneously work with the Company to achieve
    federal tax compliance and resolve issues prior to the filing of
    a tax return. CAP is designed to eliminate or substantially
    reduce the need for post-filing examinations of future tax
    returns. The audit of fiscal years 2004 and 2005 is currently
    underway.

Related
    Party Transactions

One of the Company’s directors, who has served on the
    Company’s Board of Directors since 1988, became a director
    of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, in
    fiscal 2002 and continues to serve as a director of TSMC.
    Management believes the terms and prices for the purchases of
    products from TSMC are not affected by the presence of one of
    the Company’s directors on the Board of Directors of TSMC.
    The Company purchased approximately $281 million,
    $224 million and $337 million of product from TSMC in
    fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and
    approximately $17 million and $27 million was payable
    to TSMC as of October 28, 2006 and October 29, 2005,
    respectively. Management anticipates that the Company will make
    significant purchases from TSMC in fiscal year 2007.

Gain on
    Sale of Product Line

During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, on February 21,
    2006, the Company completed the sale to Ikanos Communications,
    Inc. of its DSP-based digital subscriber line (DSL)
    application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and network
    processor product line. The Company received approximately
    $23.1 million in cash for the product line and after
    providing for the write-off of inventory, fixed assets and other
    costs incurred to complete the transaction, recorded a net gain
    of approximately $13.0 million in nonoperating income
    during the second quarter of fiscal 2006.

18.

Subsequent
    Events

On November 13, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company
    declared a cash dividend of $0.16 per outstanding share of
    common stock. The dividend will be paid on December 13,
    2006 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on
    November 24, 2006.

On November 8, 2006, the Company became entitled to
    $35 million of consideration in exchange for licensing of
    certain intellectual property rights to a third party. On
    November 9, 2006, the Company received the payment from the
    third party. The Company will record this as revenue in the
    first quarter of fiscal 2007.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Analog Devices, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Analog Devices, Inc. as of October 28, 2006 and
    October 29, 2005, and the related consolidated statements
    of income, shareholders’ equity, comprehensive income, and
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    October 28, 2006. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(c). These
    financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Analog Devices, Inc. at October 28,
    2006 and October 29, 2005, and the consolidated results of
    its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended October 28, 2006, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
    information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of Analog Devices, Inc.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of October 28, 2006, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission and our report dated November 16, 2006
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective October 30, 2005, the Company adopted
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

(a)

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
    Procedures.

Our management, with the
    participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of Analog’s disclosure
    controls and procedures as of October 28, 2006. The term
    “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a
    company that are designed to ensure that information required to
    be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or
    submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
    the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
    procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
    designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
    a company in the reports that it files or submits under the
    Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
    company’s management, including its principal executive and
    principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely
    decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes
    that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
    and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
    their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment
    in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
    and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures as of October 28, 2006, our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as
    of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were
    effective at the reasonable assurance level.

(b)

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal
    control over financial reporting is defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

or

15d-15(f)

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers and effected by the company’s board of directors,
    management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
    regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
    preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
    includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of the company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
    that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
    only in accordance with authorizations of management and
    directors of the company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
    are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting as of October 28, 2006. In
    making this assessment, the company’s management used the
    criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
    of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated
    Framework.

Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of
    October 28, 2006, our internal control over financial
    reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Our independent auditors have issued an audit report on our
    assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.
    This report appears below.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Analog Devices, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting, that Analog Devices, Inc. maintained
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    October 28, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
    of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO
    criteria). Analog Devices, Inc.’s management is responsible
    for maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
    opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Analog
    Devices, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
    financial reporting as of October 28, 2006, is fairly
    stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria.
    Also, in our opinion, Analog Devices, Inc. maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of October 28, 2006, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Analog Devices, Inc. as of
    October 28, 2006 and October 29, 2005, and the related
    consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity,
    comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years
    in the period ended October 28, 2006 of Analog Devices,
    Inc. and our report dated November 16, 2006 expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.
