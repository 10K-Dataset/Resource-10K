ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Company Overview

We are a world leader in the design, manufacture
and marketing of high-performance analog, mixed-signal and
digital signal processing integrated circuits used in signal
processing for industrial, communication, computer and consumer
applications. Since our inception in 1965, we have focused on
solving the engineering challenges associated with signal
processing in electronic equipment. Signal processing is where
the analog and digital worlds meet to provide the advantages of
digital technologies to the real world. Our products play a
fundamental role in converting real-world phenomena such as
temperature, motion, pressure, light and sound into electrical
signals to be used in a wide array of electronic equipment
ranging from industrial process control, factory automation
systems equipment, defense electronics, base stations, central
office equipment, wireless telephones, computers, automobiles,
CAT scanners, digital cameras and DVD players. Signal processing
is the cornerstone of high-speed communications, digital
entertainment, and other consumer, computer and industrial
applications. As new generations of digital applications evolve,
they generate new needs for high-performance analog and digital
signal processing, or DSP, technology. We produce a wide range
of products that are designed to meet the technology needs of a
broad base of customers.

During fiscal 2004, approximately 36% of our
revenue came from the industrial market, which includes factory
automation, medical equipment, scientific instrumentation,
automatic test equipment, automotive electronics, security
equipment and aerospace and defense systems.

Revenues from the communications market
represented approximately 37% of our fiscal 2004 revenue.
Communications applications include wireless handsets and base
stations, as well as products used for high-speed access to the
Internet, including broadband modems and central office
networking equipment.

We also serve the personal computer market with
products that monitor and manage power usage, process signals
used in flat panel displays and multimedia projectors and enable
CD-quality audio. In fiscal 2004, the computer market accounted
for approximately 14% of our revenue.

The demand for our products used in
high-performance consumer electronics has been increasing and
represented approximately 13% of our revenue for fiscal 2004.
Applications in this market include digital cameras and
camcorders, DVD players, advanced digital televisions and
surround sound audio systems.

We sell our products worldwide through a direct
sales force, third-party distributors and independent sales
representatives. We have direct sales offices in 19 countries,
including the United States.

We are headquartered near Boston, in Norwood,
Massachusetts, and have manufacturing facilities in
Massachusetts, California, North Carolina, Ireland and the
Philippines. We were founded in 1965 and are incorporated in
Massachusetts. As of October 30, 2004, we employed
approximately 8,900 individuals worldwide. Our common stock is
listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ADI and
is included in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.

We maintain a website with the address
www.analog.com. We are not including the information contained

Industry Background

All electronic signals fall into one of two
categories, analog or digital. Analog, also known as linear,
signals represent real-world phenomena, such as temperature,
pressure, sound, speed and motion. This information can be
detected and measured using analog sensors, which represent
real-world phenomena by generating continuously-varying voltages
and currents. The signals from these sensors are initially
processed using analog methods, such as amplification, filtering
and shaping. They are then usually converted to digital form for
storage or further manipulation. The further manipulation of the
signals after conversion to digital form is called “digital
signal processing.” Digital signals represent the
“ones” and “zeros” of binary arithmetic and
are either on or off. Digital signals are frequently converted
back to analog form for functions such as video display, audio
output or control. These manipulations and transformations from
analog to digital and back to analog are known as
“real-world signal processing” within the signal chain.

Significant advances in semiconductor technology
in recent years have substantially increased the performance and
functionality of integrated circuits, or ICs, used in signal
processing applications. These advances include the ability to
combine analog and digital signal processing capability on a
single chip, thereby making possible more highly-integrated
solutions. The widespread application of low-cost
microprocessor-based systems and of digital communication
technologies has increased the need for signal conditioning
interfaces between the analog and digital world. At the same
time, the convergence of computing and communications has
resulted in end products that incorporate state-of-the-art
signal processing capability onto as few chips as possible. Our
products are designed to be used within electronic equipment to
achieve higher performance, including greater speed, improved
accuracy, more efficient signal processing and minimized power
consumption.

Principal Products

We design, manufacture and market a broad line of
high-performance ICs that incorporate analog, mixed-signal and
digital signal processing technologies. Our ICs are designed to
address a wide range of real-world signal processing
applications. Across the entire range of our signal processing
ICs are both general purpose products used by a broad range of
customers and applications as well as application-specific
products designed for specific clusters of customers in vertical
markets. By using readily available, high-performance,
general-purpose products in their systems, our customers can
reduce the time they need to bring new products to market. Given
the high cost of developing customized ICs, our standard
products often provide the most cost-effective solution for many
low to medium volume applications. In some communications,
computer and consumer products, we focus on working with leading
customers to design application-specific solutions. We begin
with our existing core technologies in analog and DSP, and
devise a solution to more closely meet the needs of a specific
customer or group of customers. Because we have already
developed the core technology for our general-purpose products,
we can create application-specific solutions quickly.

We produce and market several thousand products.
Our ten highest revenue products accounted for approximately 17%
of our revenue for fiscal 2004. The majority of our products are
proprietary, meaning equivalent products are not available from
competitors. A limited number of other companies may provide
products with similar functions.

Analog Products

Our analog IC technology has been the
foundation of our business for nearly four decades, and we
believe we are one of the world’s largest suppliers of
analog ICs. Our analog ICs are primarily
high-performance devices, generally defined as devices that
support a minimum of 10-bits of accuracy and a minimum of 50
megahertz of speed. The principal advantages these applications
have versus competitors’ products include higher accuracy,
lower cost per function, smaller size, lower power consumption
and fewer components for improved reliability. The majority of
our analog IC product revenue is attributable to sales of
data converters and amplifiers. The data converter and amplifier
product categories represented approximately 60% of our fiscal
2004 revenue. Other analog IC products include analog
signal processing devices such as analog multipliers, switches,
multiplexers and comparators. Over the past several years we
have been expanding our



analog IC product offerings along the entire
analog signal chain and into product areas such as radio
frequency integrated circuits, or RF ICs, and power
management products such as voltage regulators and thermal
monitoring ICs.

The majority of our analog IC products are
proprietary to us in their design and general purpose in their
application. This allows customers to incorporate our products
into a wide variety of electronic equipment and systems. Our
product portfolio includes several thousand analog ICs, any one
of which can have as many as several hundred customers. Our
analog ICs typically have long product life cycles. Our
analog IC customers include both original equipment
manufacturers, or OEMs, and customers who build electronic
subsystems for integration into larger systems.

Our analog technology base also includes products
using an advanced IC technology known in the industry as surface
micromachining, which is used to produce semiconductor products
known as micro-electromechanical systems, or MEMS. This
technology enables extremely small mechanical sensors to be
built on the surface of a chip along with supporting circuitry.
In addition to incorporating an electro-mechanical structure,
these devices also have analog circuitry for conditioning
signals obtained from the sensing element. The integration of
signal conditioning and MEMS is a unique feature of our products
which we call iMEMS®. Our iMEMS product portfolio includes
accelerometers used to sense acceleration, and gyroscopes used
to sense position. The majority of our current revenue from
micromachined products is derived from accelerometers used by
automotive manufacturers in airbag applications. However,
revenue from consumer and industrial customers is increasing as
we develop products using this technology for applications in
these end markets.

DSP Products

DSPs are processors that are optimized for
high-speed numeric calculations, which are essential for
real-time processing of digital data resulting from analog to
digital signal conversion. Our DSP products are designed to be
fully programmable and to efficiently execute specialized
software programs, or algorithms, associated with processing
digitized real-time, real-world data. Programmable DSPs provide
the flexibility to modify the device’s function quickly and
inexpensively in software. We offer both general-purpose and
application-specific DSP products. General-purpose DSP IC
customers typically write their own algorithms using software
tools that we provide and software tools they obtain from
third-party suppliers. Our application-specific DSP products
typically include analog and DSP technology and the DSPs are
preprogrammed to execute software for applications such as
wireless telecommunications or image processing. Our DSPs are
designed in families of products that share a common
architecture and therefore can execute the same software. We
support these products with specialized applications and
easy-to-use, low-cost development tools, which reduce our
customers’ product development costs and time-to-market.

Increasingly, many of our products combine analog
and digital signal processing technology into multi-function
mixed-signal devices and chipsets. The growing technological
demands associated with the use of audio and video in computers
and consumer products as well as the networking of
communications systems has created new opportunities for these
mixed-signal products. Examples of these products include
chipsets for communication applications such as global system
for mobile cellular phones, or GSM, cable modems, and broadband
modems. Other examples include audio input/output devices for
computer applications and electric motor control devices for
industrial instrumentation.

Markets and Applications

The following describes some of the
characteristics of, and customer products within, our major
markets:

Industrial

—
Our industrial market includes the following areas:

Industrial Process
Automation

— Our industrial
process automation market includes applications such as factory
automation systems, automatic process control systems, robotics,
environmental control systems and automatic test equipment.
These products generally require ICs that offer performance
greater than that available from commodity-level ICs, but
generally do not have production volumes that warrant custom or



application-specific ICs. Combinations of analog
mixed-signal and DSP ICs are usually employed to achieve the
necessary functionality. Automatic test equipment applications
have created opportunities for the design of system-level ICs
that require a high level of electronic circuitry.

Instrumentation

—
Our instrumentation market includes engineering, medical and
scientific instruments. These products are usually designed
using the highest performance analog and mixed-signal ICs
available. Customer products include oscilloscopes, logic
analyzers, CAT scanners, MRI equipment, blood analyzers and
microscopes.

Defense/Aerospace

—
The defense, commercial avionics and space markets all require
high-performance ICs that meet rigorous environmental and
reliability specifications. Many of our analog ICs can be
supplied in versions that meet these standards. In addition,
many products can be supplied to meet the standards required for
broadcast satellites and other commercial space applications.
Most of our products sold in this market are specifically-tested
versions of products derived from our standard product offering.
Customer products include navigation systems, flight simulators,
radar systems and security devices.

Automotive

—
Although the automotive market has historically been served with
low-cost, low-performance ICs, demand has emerged for higher
performance devices for a wide range of safety and entertainment
applications. In response, we are developing products
specifically for the automotive market. We supply a
micromachined IC used as a crash sensor in airbag systems. We
believe that other micromachined devices derived from this
product may be suitable for other automotive applications, such
as roll-over sensing, global positioning satellite, or GPS,
automotive navigation systems, anti-lock brakes and
“smart” suspension systems. In addition, our analog
and DSP ICs have application in engine control, in-cabin
electronics, and collision avoidance systems.

Communications

—
The development of broadband, wireless and Internet
infrastructures around the world has created an important market
for our communications products. Communications technology
involves the acquisition of analog signals that are converted
from analog to digital and digital to analog form during the
process of transmitting and receiving data. The need for higher
speed and reduced power consumption, coupled with more reliable,
bandwidth-efficient communications, has been creating demand for
our products. Our products are used in the full spectrum of
signal processing for audio, data, image and video
communication. In wireless and broadband communication
applications, our products are incorporated into cellular
telephones, cellular base station equipment, modems, pagers, PBX
switches, routers and remote access servers.

Computers and Computer
Peripherals

— Increased
interface between users and PCs through monitors, printers,
scanners and audio devices and the increasing need for power and
thermal management capability in PCs have provided opportunities
in the computer market. The computer industry seeks to develop
and market ever smaller and lighter personal computers. This
need increases demand for high-performance ICs that monitor
power usage, enabling manufacturers to use smaller batteries and
extend battery life between charges. In addition, we currently
supply a variety of ICs used in this market for functions such
as graphic displays, interfaces between PCs and peripherals such
as LCD monitors and projectors, and enhanced audio input and
output capability for business and entertainment applications.

Consumer
Electronics

— Increased
market demand for digital entertainment systems for acquisition,
display and digital processing of signals has allowed us to
combine analog and digital design capability to provide
solutions that are designed to meet the rigorous cost, size and
reliability constraints of the consumer electronics market. The
emergence of high-performance, feature-rich consumer products,
such as digital camcorders and cameras, home theater systems,
advanced digital televisions, video projectors and DVD
recorders/players, has led to the need for high-performance,
system-level ICs with a high level of specific functionality.

Research and Development

Our markets are characterized by rapid
technological changes and advances. Accordingly, we make
substantial investments in the design and development of new
products and processes, and the improvement of



existing products and processes. We spent
approximately $512 million during fiscal 2004 on the
design, development and improvement of new and existing products
and processes, compared to approximately $450 million
during fiscal 2003 and approximately $424 million during
fiscal 2002.

Our research and development strategy focuses on
building technical leadership in core technologies for signal
conditioning, conversion and processing. In support of our
research and development activities, we employ thousands of
engineers involved in product and process development at over
28 design centers and manufacturing sites located
throughout the world.

Patents and Other Intellectual Property
Rights

As of October 30, 2004, we held
935 United States patents and had 569 patent applications
pending with the United States Patent and Trademark Office with
expiration dates ranging from 2004 through 2023. We believe that
while our patents may provide some advantage, our competitive
position is largely determined by such factors as the system and
application knowledge, ability and experience of our personnel,
the range and number of new products being developed by us, our
market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts, customer
service and technical support. It is generally our policy to
seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be
patented, though we may elect, in certain cases, not to seek
patent protection even for significant inventions, if other
protection, such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret,
is considered more advantageous. We also have trademarks that
are used in the conduct of our business to distinguish genuine
Analog Devices’ products and we maintain cooperative
advertising programs to promote our brands and identify products
containing genuine Analog Devices’ components. In addition,
we have registered certain of our mask sets under the
Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984.

There can be no assurance that any patent will
issue on pending applications or that any patent issued will
provide substantive protection for the technology or product
covered by it. There also can be no assurance that others will
not develop or patent similar technology or reverse engineer our
products or that our confidentiality agreements with employees,
consultants, silicon foundries and other suppliers and vendors
will be adequate to protect our interests. Moreover, the laws of
countries in which we design, manufacture and market our
products may afford little or no effective protection of our
proprietary technology.

The semiconductor industry is characterized by
frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other
intellectual property rights, including claims arising under our
contractual indemnification of our customers. We have received
from time to time, and may receive in the future, claims from
third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe
their patents or other intellectual property rights. In the
event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim
against us and a license is not available to us on commercially
reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to
redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that
intellectual property, and our operating results could be
materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary
to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property
rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this
litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key
personnel. See Note 11 in the Notes to our Consolidated
Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K for information concerning pending
litigation that involves us. An adverse outcome in this or other
litigation could have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results
of operations or cash flows in the period in which the
litigation is resolved.

Sales Channels

We sell our products in North America and
internationally through a direct sales force, third-party
distributors, independent sales representatives and via our
worldwide website on the Internet.

The fastest growing part of our business has been
to customers in markets other than North America and Europe.
Approximately 19% of our fiscal 2004 net sales were to
customers in Japan. Approximately 14% of our fiscal
2004 net sales were to customers in China and approximately
22% were to customers elsewhere in Asia, principally Taiwan and
Korea. As of October 30, 2004, we had direct sales offices
in the Asia region in China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea,
Singapore and Taiwan.



Approximately 25% of our fiscal 2004 net
sales were to customers in North America. As of October 30,
2004, we had 10 direct sales offices in the United States.

Approximately 20% of our fiscal 2004 net
sales were to customers in Europe. As of October 30, 2004,
we had direct sales offices in Austria, Belgium, Denmark,
France, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and the
United Kingdom.

We also had sales representatives and/or
distributors in over 45 countries outside North America,
including countries where we also have direct sales offices. For
further detail regarding financial information about geographic
areas, see Note 3 in the Notes to our Consolidated
Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

Approximately 50% of our fiscal 2004 revenue was
derived from sales made through distributors. Revenue is
deferred on sales made through distributors until the
distributors resell the products to the end users. These
distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products.
Some of them also sell products competitive with our products,
including those for which we are an alternate source. Sales to
certain distributors are made under agreements that provide
protection to the distributors for their inventory of our
products against price reductions and products that are
slow-moving or that we have discontinued, including limited
product return privileges.

Our worldwide technical direct field sales
efforts are supported by an extensive promotional program that
includes editorial coverage and paid advertising in trade
publications, direct mail programs, promotional brochures,
technical seminars and participation in trade shows. We publish
and distribute full-length databooks, product catalogs,
applications guides, technical handbooks and detailed data
sheets for individual products. We also provide product and
application information and sell products via our worldwide
website on the Internet. We maintain a staff of field
application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our
products into their products.

We have tens of thousands of customers worldwide.
Our largest single customer, excluding distributors, represented
approximately 3% of our fiscal 2004 net sales, and our 20
largest customers, excluding distributors, accounted for
approximately 29% of our fiscal 2004 net sales.

Foreign Operations

Through subsidiaries and affiliates, we conduct
business in numerous countries outside the United States. During
fiscal 2004, approximately 75% of our revenue was derived from
customers in international markets. Our international business
is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign
operations, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates and controls, import and export controls, and other laws,
policies and regulations of foreign governments.

We have manufacturing facilities outside the
United States in Ireland and the Philippines. In addition to
being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the
semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic and
political risks inherent in international operations and their
impact on the United States economy in general, including the
risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and
economic instability in many countries around the world as well
as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism, and the
response to them by the United States and its allies. These
risks include air transportation disruptions, expropriation,
currency controls, currency exchange rate movement, and
additional costs related to tax, tariff and freight rates.
Although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our
exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no
assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely
affected by changes in the exchange rate of the United States
dollar against other currencies.

Production and Raw Materials

Monolithic integrated circuit components are
manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps
that include wafer fabrication, wafer testing, cutting the wafer
into individual “chips,” or dice, assembly of the dice
into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final
packaged form. The raw materials used to



manufacture these devices include silicon wafers,
processing chemicals (including liquefied gases), precious
metals, ceramic and plastic used for packaging.

We develop and employ a wide variety of
proprietary processes that are specifically tailored for use in
fabricating high-performance linear, mixed-signal and MEMS ICs.
We also use bipolar and CMOS wafer fabrication processes.

Our IC products are fabricated both at our
production facilities and by third-party wafer fabricators. Most
of our analog products are manufactured in our own wafer
fabrication facilities using proprietary processes. Our DSP
products, and a portion of our analog products, are manufactured
at third-party wafer-fabrication foundries using sub-micron
digital CMOS processes. We operate wafer fabrication facilities
in Wilmington and Cambridge, Massachusetts; Sunnyvale,
California and Limerick, Ireland. We also operate assembly and
test facilities located in the Philippines and use third-party
subcontractors.

Capital spending in fiscal 2004 was
$146 million, compared with $68 million in fiscal
2003. We currently plan to make capital expenditures of
approximately $150 million in fiscal 2005. We believe we
currently have ample installed capacity to significantly
increase internal production levels with modest additional
capital expenditures.

Our products require a wide variety of components
and raw materials, most of which we purchase from third-party
suppliers. We have multiple sources for the majority of the
components and materials we purchase and incorporate into our
products. However, in some cases, we purchase components from
sole-source suppliers, such as external foundries. If these
sole-source suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and
deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time
schedule and of the quality that we require, we may be forced to
engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result
in additional expenses and delays in product development or
shipment of product to our customers. Although we have
experienced shortages of components from time to time, these
items have generally been available to us as needed.

Backlog

Backlog at the end of fiscal 2004 was
approximately $329 million, down from approximately
$387 million at the end of fiscal 2003. This decrease was
due to the reduced order levels and increased order
cancellations as a result of what we believe was an inventory
correction during our third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2004.
We define backlog as of a particular date as firm orders with a
customer requested delivery date within thirteen weeks. Backlog
is impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead
times available from suppliers, including us, in periods of
depressed demand. In periods of increased demand, there is a
tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of
increasing backlog and, in some instances, we may not have
manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders. As is
customary in the semiconductor industry, we allow most orders to
be canceled or deliveries delayed by customers without
significant penalty. Accordingly, we believe that our backlog at
any time should not be used as an indication of our future
revenue.

Government Contracts

We estimate that approximately 3% of our fiscal
2004 revenue was attributable to sales to the
U.S. government and government contractors and
subcontractors. Our government contract business is
predominantly in the form of negotiated, firm fixed-price
subcontracts. All such contracts and subcontracts contain
standard provisions relating to termination at the election of
the United States government.

Competition

We compete with a number of semiconductor
companies in markets that are highly competitive. We believe we
are one of the largest suppliers of high-performance analog and
mixed-signal processing components. Competitors for our analog
and DSP products include Cirrus Logic Inc., Linear Technology
Corporation, Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., National
Semiconductor Corporation, Phillips Semiconductor, ST
Microelectronics and Texas Instruments, Inc. Sales of our
micromachined products are currently



comprised of acceleration sensors and gyroscopes,
and our main competitors in that market are Bosch, Freescale
Semiconductor, Inc., Denso Corporation and ST Microelectronics.

We believe that competitive performance in the
marketplace for real-world signal processing components depends
upon several factors, including technical innovation, product
quality and reliability, range of products, product price,
customer service and technical support. We believe our technical
innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability,
supported by our commitment to strong customer service and
technical support, enables us to compete in our chosen markets
against both foreign and domestic semiconductor manufacturers.

Many other companies offer products that compete
with our products, and some have greater financial,
manufacturing, technical and marketing resources than we have.
Additionally, some formerly-independent competitors have been
purchased by larger companies. Our competitors also include
emerging companies selling specialized products to markets we
serve. There can be no assurances that we will be able to
compete successfully in the future against existing or new
competitors, or that our operating results will not be adversely
affected by increased price competition.

Environment

Our manufacturing facilities are subject to
numerous environmental laws and regulations, particularly with
respect to industrial waste and emissions. Compliance with these
laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our
capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

We are committed to protecting the environment
and the health and safety of our employees, customers and the
public. We endeavor to adhere to the most stringent standards
across all of our facilities, to encourage pollution prevention
and to strive towards continual improvement. We strive to exceed
compliance with regulatory standards in order to achieve a
standard of excellence in environmental, health and safety
management practices as an integral part of our total quality
management system.

Employees

As of October 30, 2004, we employed
approximately 8,900 individuals worldwide. Our future success
depends in large part on the continued service of our key
technical and senior management personnel, and on our ability to
continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees,
particularly those highly-skilled design, process, test and
applications engineers involved in the manufacture of existing
products and the development of new products and processes. We
believe that relations with our employees are good, however the
competition for such personnel is intense, and the loss of key
employees could have a material adverse effect on us.



ITEM 2.     PROPERTIES

Our corporate headquarters is located in Norwood,
Massachusetts. Manufacturing and other operations are conducted
in several locations worldwide. The following tables provide
certain information about our principal general offices and
manufacturing facilities:

In addition to the principal leased properties
listed in the previous table, we also lease sales offices and
other premises at 28 locations in the United States and 31
locations overseas under operating lease agreements. These
leases expire at various dates through the year 2015. We do not
anticipate experiencing significant difficulty in retaining
occupancy of any of our manufacturing, office or sales
facilities through lease renewals prior to expiration or through
month-to-month occupancy, or in replacing them with equivalent
facilities. For information concerning our obligations under all

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On June 17, 2002, we received a letter from
Plasma Physics Corporation attaching a courtesy copy of a
complaint it had filed against us in the Eastern District of New
York alleging infringement by certain of our products of two
patents held by Plasma Physics. In the letter, Plasma Physics
indicated that it would like to license the patents to us. The
letter further stated that Plasma Physics would forego service
of the complaint for a period of 120 days, provided that we
would agree to undertake negotiations over terms for licensing
the above-referenced patents. On October 17, 2002, Plasma
Physics served the complaint. We have answered the complaint
denying the allegations. The case is proceeding through
discovery and the ultimate outcome is unknown.

On March 4, 2003, Motorola, Inc. filed an
action in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Texas against us, alleging that we infringed five
patents owned by Motorola relating to semiconductor processing
and semiconductor chip design. On March 11, 2003, Motorola
filed a first amended complaint asserting the same five patents.
The first amended complaint sought injunctive relief and
unspecified damages. On April 17, 2003, we filed a motion
under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for a more definite
statement of Motorola’s allegations. Motorola opposed that
motion, and, by order dated July 18, 2003, the Court denied
our motion. On August 5, 2003, we filed an answer and also
counterclaimed against Motorola. In the counterclaim, we
asserted that Motorola infringed six of our patents relating to
semiconductor technology. Motorola responded to our
counterclaims on September 10, 2003. In 2004, a subsidiary
of Motorola, Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., joined the case as a
plaintiff and counterclaim-defendant. The parties have reached a
settlement of the case, and on September 1, 2004 all claims
and counterclaims were dismissed with prejudice. This settlement
did not have a material impact on our financial position or
results of operations.

On November 6, 2003, Enron Corporation
commenced a proceeding in the United States Bankruptcy Court for
the Southern District of New York. On December 1, 2003,
Enron filed an amended complaint to add us as a defendant in
such proceeding. The amended complaint alleges that transfers
made by Enron in satisfaction of obligations it had under
commercial paper are recoverable as preferential transfers and
fraudulent transfers and are subject to avoidance under the
United States Bankruptcy Code. It is alleged that payments made
in premature satisfaction of obligations under commercial paper
totaling approximately $20 million are recoverable from
J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc., Fleet Capital Markets, Fleet
National Bank and/or us. We sold $20 million of Enron
commercial paper to Fleet and did not enter into any direct
transactions with Enron. We filed a motion to dismiss the
adversary proceeding. The motion to dismiss was argued at a
hearing on September 21, 2004. The court took the matter
under advisement and we are awaiting a decision. We intend to
vigorously defend against these claims. Although we believe we
have meritorious defenses to the asserted claims, we are unable
at this time to predict the outcome of this proceeding.

We are currently under audit by the United States
Internal Revenue Service for fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003.
The audit has not been completed and the IRS has not issued a
report on its audit.

We have received notice that the SEC is
conducting an inquiry into our granting of stock options over
the last five years to officers and directors. We believe that
other companies have received similar inquiries. Each year, we
grant stock options to a broad base of employees (including
officers and directors) and in some years those grants have
occurred shortly before our issuance of favorable annual
financial results. The SEC has requested information regarding
our stock option grants and we intend to cooperate with the SEC.
We are unable to predict the outcome of the inquiry.

From time to time as a normal incidence of the
nature of our business, various claims, charges and litigation
are asserted or commenced against us arising from, or related
to, contractual matters, patents, trademarks, personal injury,
environmental matters, product liability, insurance coverage and
personnel and employment disputes. As to such claims and
litigation, including those items discussed above, we can give
no assurance that we will prevail. However, we do not believe
that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position, although an adverse outcome of
any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the quarter
or annual period in which one or more of these matters are
resolved.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
    FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (all tabular
    amounts in thousands except per share amounts and as
    noted)

Results of Operations

Overview

Fiscal years 2004 and 2003 were successful years
for Analog Devices. During these two fiscal years we experienced
a continuation of what we believe is a broad-based cyclical
improvement in the semiconductor industry that began for us in
the second quarter of fiscal 2002. We began fiscal year 2004
with a plan to increase net sales by approximately 25% and for
gross margins to continue to improve during the year. Net sales
increased by 29% to $2,634 million in fiscal 2004 up from
the $2,047 million recorded in the prior year. Our gross
margins improved by 410 basis points to 59% in fiscal 2004,
up from 54.9% recorded in fiscal 2003. For fiscal 2004 we had
anticipated that operating expenses would grow at a rate
significantly less than that of our revenue growth rate.
Operating expenses for the fiscal year increased 14%
year-to-year, or slightly less than half the growth rate of net
sales for the year. Diluted earnings per share improved to
$1.45 per share in fiscal 2004, up 86% from the
$0.78 per share recorded in fiscal 2003. Net cash provided
by operations was $778 million, or 29.5% of net sales, in
fiscal 2004.

Sales

Net sales recorded in fiscal 2004 were
$2,634 million, an increase of 29% over net sales of
$2,047 million recorded in fiscal 2003. The
$587 million increase in net sales in fiscal 2004 was a
result of what we believe was a broad-based increase in demand
for our products used in every end market we serve. Increased
demand for our products used in industrial products and
communications products accounted for approximately 77% of this
year-to-year increase and increased demand for our products used
in consumer and computer end markets accounted for the remaining
increase in net sales. Increased demand for our products used in
wireless handsets and infrastructure was the main reason for our
increased sales in the communications end market.

For fiscal 2003, net sales of $2,047 million
increased by 20% from the $1,708 million recorded in fiscal
2002. During fiscal 2003, demand was very strong for our
products used in consumer products, while demand was relatively
flat for our products used in applications that depend on
industrial, enterprise or carrier capital spending. As a result,
demand for analog and DSP products used in wireless handsets,
desktop and laptop computers, consumer products such as digital
cameras and flat panel displays increased in fiscal 2003 above
the levels experienced in fiscal 2002.

In fiscal 2004, analog product sales increased
31% from the levels recorded in fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2003,
analog product sales increased 16% from the levels recorded in
fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2004, DSP product sales increased by 21%
from the levels recorded in fiscal 2003 after increasing 35%
from the levels recorded in fiscal 2002. Over the last three
fiscal years, net sales from analog products were in the range
of 78% to 80% of net sales and sales of DSP products represented
the remaining 20% to 22% of net sales.

Sales of new products, which we define as sales
of products introduced in the prior six quarters, were 21% of
net sales in fiscal 2004 as compared to 19% in fiscal 2003 and
21% in fiscal 2002. The year-over-year dollar increase in sales
of new products was 45% in fiscal 2004 and was attributable to
increased demand and design wins for some of our products used
in communications, industrial, consumer and computer
applications. This increase followed a year-to-year dollar
increase in sales of new products of 8% in fiscal 2003 and a
year-to-year



decline of sales of new products of 17% in fiscal
2002 as we went through a down-turn in the semiconductor
industry.

The percentage of sales by geographic region,
based upon point of sale, for the last three years is as follows:

The decrease in North American and European sales
and the increase in sales in Asia and Japan as a percentage of
total net sales for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 were
attributable to the ongoing transfer of customer manufacturing
activity to Asia and increased demand for our products in Japan
and in Asia, particularly in China. The increase in sales in
dollar terms in Japan was 36% and 29%, respectively, for fiscal
2004 and fiscal 2003, and was the result of a general recovery
in demand for our products in Japan and in particular an
increase in demand for our products used in the manufacture of
automatic test equipment and consumer products. Sales in dollars
increased in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 by 73% and 75%,
respectively, in China and by 16% and 27%, respectively, in the
Rest of Asia as a result of increased demand for products used
in communications, industrial, consumer, and computer products.
In fiscal 2004, sales in dollar terms increased by 20% in Europe
and 24% in North America because of the broad-based improvement
in demand for our products used in industrial, communications,
consumer and computer products. Sales in dollars in fiscal 2003
increased by 12% as compared to fiscal 2002 in Europe as a
result of the steady improvement in demand for our products
during the year. The slight increase in fiscal 2003 North
America sales in dollars as compared to fiscal 2002 was
attributable to increased demand for our products that was
largely offset by the transfer of customer manufacturing
activity to locations in Asia.

Gross Margin

Gross margin improved in fiscal 2004 to
$1,554 million, or 59% of net sales, up 410 basis
points from the gross margin of $1,124 million, or 54.9% of
net sales, recorded in fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2002, gross
margins were $905 million, or 53% of net sales. The
improvement in gross margins for both fiscal 2003 and fiscal
2004 was primarily the result of spreading fixed manufacturing
costs over an increasing sales level and, to a lesser extent,
the impact of restructuring actions taken in recent years as
well as continued tight cost control at our manufacturing
operations.

Research and Development

R&D expenses for fiscal 2004 increased by
$62 million, or 14%, to $512 million from the
$450 million recorded in fiscal 2003. R&D expenses
increased $26 million, or 6%, to $450 million in
fiscal 2003 from the $424 million recorded in fiscal 2002.
R&D expenses declined as a percentage of net sales to 19.4%
in fiscal 2004 from 22% in fiscal 2003 and from 24.8% in fiscal
2002 as a result of the 29% and 20% year-to-year increase in
revenue for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively. R&D
expenses increased by 14% year-to-year in fiscal 2004 primarily
as a result of additional salary and benefit costs associated
with a 5% increase in engineering headcount during the year.
These expenses also increased as a result of annual salary
increases and increased bonus payments and, to a lesser extent,
an increase in other engineering expenses reflecting the
increased R&D activity during the year. For fiscal 2003, the
year-to-year increase in R&D expenses was



limited to 6% as a result of acquisition-related
expenses declining year-to-year by $5.6 million and the
company limiting discretionary expenses including salary
increases for higher paid employees and curtailing hiring to
strategically important new hires and college hires. The
reduction in acquisition-related expenses to $8.2 million
in fiscal 2003 from $13.8 million in fiscal 2002 arose
primarily because fiscal 2002 costs included additional expenses
related to fixed-value contingent compensation and the
achievement of final performance-based criteria that did not
recur in fiscal 2003.

R&D expense as a percentage of net sales will
fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of net sales
and the success of new product development efforts, which we
view as critical to our future growth. At any point in time we
have hundreds of R&D projects underway, and we believe that
none of these projects is material on an individual basis. We
expect to continue the development of innovative technologies
and processes for new products and we believe that a continued
commitment to R&D is essential in order to maintain product
leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative
new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to
make significant R&D investments in the future.

Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative
    (SMG&A)

SMG&A expenses increased in fiscal 2004 by
$52 million, or 18%, from the levels recorded in fiscal
2003. In fiscal 2003, the increase in SMG&A expenses was
$31 million, or 12%, from the $257 million recorded in
fiscal 2002. As a percentage of net sales, SMG&A declined
over the past two fiscal years primarily due to the increases in
net sales for each of those years. For fiscal 2004, the increase
in SMG&A expenses over the levels recorded in fiscal 2003
was primarily a result of increased salary and employee benefit
costs and bonus payments to employees, increased commission
payments as a result of the 29% year-to-year increase in net
sales and, to a lesser extent, increased legal costs associated
with patent and intellectual property activity and other expense
increases associated with selling and marketing activities. The
increase in SMG&A expenses in fiscal 2003 over fiscal 2002
was primarily the result of increased commission amounts paid
due to the 20% year-to-year increase in net sales, the decision
to add additional field application engineers to assist existing
and potential customers to design products that incorporate ADI
technology to address their specific requirements, as well as
initiatives to publicize new products. These increases were
offset by limitations on discretionary expenses including salary
increases for higher paid employees.

Amortization of Intangibles

Amortization of intangibles was $3 million
for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 compared with $57 million
for fiscal 2002. The decrease in amortization expense in fiscal
2003 from the levels recorded in fiscal 2002 was the result of
our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 142, or FAS 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,

effective November 3, 2002, which results in
goodwill no longer being amortized.

Special Charges

During fiscal 2003, we recorded special charges
of $9.5 million, and during fiscal 2002 we recorded special
charges totaling $48.5 million. Special charges recorded in
fiscal years 2003 and 2002 are more fully described under the
heading “Special Charges” below. There were no special
charges recorded in fiscal 2004.

Operating Income

Our operating income was $699 million, or
26.6% of net sales, in fiscal 2004, compared to
$374 million, or 18.3% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. The
improvement in operating income as a percentage of net sales in
fiscal 2004 over the levels recorded in fiscal 2003 was a result
of the 410 basis point year-to-year improvement in gross
margin combined with operating expense increases that were
limited to 14%, which was less than half



the 29% increase in net sales for the year.
Operating income was $118 million, or 6.9% of net sales, in
fiscal 2002.

Nonoperating Income and Expense

Interest expense was $0.2 million in fiscal
2004, $32 million in fiscal 2003 and $44 million in
fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2003 included interest expense for only
11 months and fiscal 2002 included interest expense for
12 months as we redeemed our $1,200 million
4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes, or notes, on
October 1, 2003. In addition, an interest rate swap
agreement we entered into in January 2002 had the effect of
swapping the 4.75% fixed rate of our notes into a LIBOR-based
floating rate that was 1.61% as of November 6, 2002 and was
1.14% at the time we redeemed our notes on October 1, 2003.
These two items resulted in the year-to-year decline in interest
expense from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003.

Interest income was $36 million in fiscal
2004 compared to $41 million in fiscal 2003 and
$65 million in fiscal 2002. The year-to-year decrease in
interest income in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was
attributable to lower average invested cash balances in fiscal
2004 due to the note redemption in 2003. This was partially
mitigated by our decision in fiscal 2004 to increase our
holdings of longer term, high-credit quality bonds, which offer
higher yields than shorter-term investments, and higher interest
rates later in fiscal 2004 as a result of actions taken by the
Federal Reserve Board. The year-to-year decrease in interest
income in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was
attributable to less income earned on our invested cash balances
due to the decline in interest rates during fiscal 2003 as a
result of actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board and our
decision to increase our holdings of higher credit quality yet
lower interest-bearing investments.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our effective income tax rate was 22% for fiscal
2004 and fiscal 2003 as compared to 25% for fiscal 2002. The
decrease in the effective rate from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003
was primarily the result of the discontinuance of non-deductible
goodwill amortization in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 as a
result of our adoption of FAS 142. Goodwill was treated as
a permanent difference in the fiscal 2002 tax provision, which
had the effect of increasing our effective income tax rate.

Net Income

Fiscal 2004 net income was
$571 million, or 21.7% of net sales, and diluted earnings
per share was $1.45 compared to net income in fiscal 2003 of
$298 million, or 14.6% of net sales, and diluted earnings
per share of $0.78. The fiscal 2004 increase in net income of
$272 million from the level recorded in fiscal 2003 was
primarily due to the year-to-year increase in net sales and, to
a lesser extent, the improvement in operating income as a
percentage of net sales from 18.3% recorded in fiscal 2003 to
26.6% recorded in fiscal 2004. For fiscal 2002 net income
was $105 million, or 6.2% of net sales. The improvement in
net income in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was the result
of an increase in net sales, the cessation of goodwill
amortization and reduced expenses related to special charges.

The impact of inflation on our business during
the past three fiscal years has not been significant.

Related Party Transactions

One of our directors, who has been a director
since 1988, became a director of Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, in fiscal 2002. We purchased
approximately $337 million, $232 million and
$206 million of products from TSMC in fiscal years 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively. We believe that the terms and
prices for the purchases of these products are at terms no less
favorable than those that could be



obtained from unaffiliated parties. Approximately
$15 million and $14 million was payable to TSMC as of
October 30, 2004 and November 1, 2003, respectively.
We anticipate that we will make significant purchases from TSMC
in fiscal year 2005.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

During fiscal 2004, net cash provided by
operations increased by $345 million from the amount
recorded in the prior year primarily due to the year-to-year
increase in net income of $272 million. During fiscal 2004
we received $124 million in proceeds from our various
employee stock programs. These cash inflows were partially
offset by the repurchase of approximately $137 million of
our common stock, additions to property, plant and equipment of
$146 million and our payment of cash dividends of
$75 million in fiscal 2004. Cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments increased by $568 million during
fiscal 2004 to $2,685 million at October 30, 2004.

During fiscal 2003, net cash from operations
increased by $207 million from the amount recorded in
fiscal 2002, primarily due to a year-to-year increase in net
income of $193 million. In fiscal 2003, we received
$71 million from our employee stock plans. Cash inflows in
fiscal 2003 were offset by additions to property, plant and
equipment of $68 million and by a net payment of
$1,198 million related to the redemption of all of our
outstanding notes together with the associated redemption
premium and the termination of the related interest rate swap
and loan agreement. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments decreased by $781 million during fiscal 2003 to
$2,117 million at November 1, 2003 from
$2,898 million at November 2, 2002, primarily as a
result of these activities.

Accounts receivable of $329 million at the
end of fiscal 2004 increased by $34 million, or 12%, from
$295 million at the end of fiscal 2003. This increase
resulted principally from a $75 million increase in net
sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 as compared to
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Accounts receivable of
$295 million at the end of fiscal 2003 increased
$67 million, or 29%, from $228 million at the end of
fiscal 2002. This increase resulted principally from a
$102 million increase in net sales during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003 as compared to the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2002. Days sales outstanding increased from 46 days
at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 to 48 days
at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004.
The year-to-year increase in days sales outstanding at the end
of fiscal 2003 was due to a higher level of sales in the latter
part of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 as compared to the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2002.

Inventories increased by $58 million, or
20%, from the end of fiscal 2003 to $346 million at the end
of fiscal 2004. Days cost of sales in inventory increased by
17 days to 123 days as of the end of the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2004. The increase in inventory in dollars was
the result of an increase in internal production and purchases
of fabricated wafers from external foundries in response to the
increases in demand for our products, particularly in the first
half of fiscal 2004, combined with the impact of a decline in
net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to the
levels recorded in the prior quarter. Net sales in the fourth
quarter of 2004 declined 12% from the levels recorded in the
prior quarter because incoming order rates from our customers
slowed as a result of what we believe is an inventory correction
at our customers. Inventories declined by $19 million, or
6%, from the end of fiscal 2002 to $288 million at the end
of fiscal 2003. Days cost of sales in inventory declined by
29 days to 106 days as of the end of the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003 as compared to the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2002. The decrease in inventory in dollars was
attributable to tight control of inventory levels as well as
increasing demand for our products as the fiscal year 2003
progressed.

Net additions to property, plant and equipment
were $146 million in fiscal 2004, $68 million in
fiscal 2003 and $57 million in fiscal 2002. The increase in
capital expenditures in fiscal 2004 compared to the prior year
was principally the result of additions to manufacturing
capacity at our facilities in response to the increased



demand levels for our products we experienced in
fiscal 2003 and 2004. Fiscal 2005 capital expenditures are
expected to be approximately $150 million.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we redeemed
all of our outstanding notes for cash. The redemption price was
101.90% of the principal amount of the notes, or
$1,223 million. A net pre-tax loss of $0.2 million was
recognized in other expense as a result of the redemption,
comprised of a $10.8 million gain on the redemption of the
notes that was offset by a write-off of $11 million of
deferred financing costs. The gain on the redemption of the
notes was due to the carrying value of the notes being greater
than the redemption value as a result of the mark-to-market of
the interest rate component of the notes to fair value. As a
result, apart from operating lease obligations, we had no debt
outstanding at the end of fiscal year 2003 or fiscal year 2004.

During fiscal 2004, our Board of Directors
declared cash dividends totaling $0.20 per outstanding
share of common stock, which were paid during the fiscal year.
These dividend payments amounted in total to approximately
$75 million. The payment of future dividends, if any, will
be based on our quarterly financial performance.

On August 11, 2004, our Board of Directors
authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate of
$500 million of our common stock. We may repurchase
outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time on the
open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Management
will determine the timing and amount of share repurchases.
During fiscal 2004, we repurchased approximately
$137 million of our common stock under this plan. Our
previous repurchase program announced on August 15, 2002
was terminated by resolution of our Board of Directors on
August 11, 2004.

The table below summarizes our significant
contractual obligations as of October 30, 2004:

(a)

Certain of our operating lease obligations
    include escalation clauses. These escalating payment
    requirements are reflected in the table.

(b)

Software licenses relate to contractual
    obligations we have to license electronic design automation
    software from third parties.

(c)

These payments relate to obligations under the
    Analog Devices, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, or the Deferred
    Compensation Plan. The Deferred Compensation Plan allows certain
    members of management and other highly-compensated employees and
    non-employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of
    their compensation and gains on stock options and restricted
    stock granted before July 23, 1997. The payment obligations
    reflected in the table include the planned distributions from
    the Deferred Compensation Plan for participants who have
    terminated employment prior to October 30, 2004 and elected
    to have their plan balance distributed in installments. The
    amount in the “More than 5 Years” column of the
    table represents the remaining total balance under the Deferred
    Compensation Plan to be paid to participants who have not
    terminated employment or elected to withdraw their balances
    prior to October 30, 2004. Since we cannot reasonably
    estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not
    yet terminated employment or elected to withdraw their balances,
    we have included the future obligation to these participants in
    the “More than 5 Years” column of the table.



(d)

Our funding policy for our foreign defined
    benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each
    country. The payment obligations in the table are estimates of
    our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2005.
    The actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented
    in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one
    year are not practical because of potential future changes in
    variables such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the
    rate of increase in compensation levels.

Purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials
and other goods and services are not included in the table
above. We are not able to determine the total amount of these
purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as
purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather
than binding agreements. In addition, our purchase orders
generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties.
We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw
materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set
prices that exceed our expected short term requirements.

The expected timing of payment and amounts of the
obligations discussed above are estimated based on current
information.

At October 30, 2004, our principal source of
liquidity was $2,685 million of cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments. We believe that our existing sources of
liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future
operations, together with anticipated available long-term
financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital
expenditures and research and development efforts for at least
the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.

Outlook

During fiscal years 2003 and 2004, we experienced
the continuation of what we believe is a broad-based cyclical
improvement in the semiconductor industry that started for us in
the second quarter of fiscal 2002. However, during the third
quarter of fiscal 2004, incoming order rates from our customers
slowed and order cancellations increased. We believe this is the
result of an inventory correction at our customers. The level of
incoming order rates remained low through the end of the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2004. As a result, net sales in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2004 declined 12% from the levels recorded in
the prior quarter. Net sales declined in all geographic regions
but especially in China and Japan where the effects of the
inventory correction and the economic constraints imposed by the
Chinese government impacted demand for our products used in
wireless handsets, wireless infrastructure, semiconductor
capital equipment, in particular automatic test equipment, and
to a lesser extent consumer and computer products.

We are entering fiscal 2005 with a cautious
outlook particularly for the first fiscal quarter of the year.
Much of the order rate decline we have experienced appears to be
related to inventory adjustments and we believe we have already
absorbed significant inventory reductions at our customers.
There continues to be much uncertainty about interest rate
levels and higher energy prices and their potential impact on
consumer spending and, as a result, our customers continue to be
cautious. Accordingly, we are entering fiscal 2005 with low
levels of backlog, which limits our visibility and makes it very
difficult to predict revenue levels for fiscal 2005.

Against this background, we are planning for
revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 to be in the range
of $575 million to $600 million and we expect gross
margins to remain at 58% to 59% and operating expenses to
decline sequentially by between 3% and 4%. Based on these
assumptions we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the
range of $0.28 to $0.31 for the first quarter of fiscal 2005.
While our current lack of visibility causes us to be cautious
about fiscal 2005, we are planning for demand for our products
to recover in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 and throughout
the fiscal year and for our financial results to reflect this
improvement in line with the expected recovery in demand. We
currently plan to make capital expenditures of approximately
$150 million in fiscal 2005. Depreciation expense is
expected to increase to approximately $160 million in
fiscal 2005 from $150 million in fiscal 2004. We anticipate
that our effective tax rate will remain relatively flat
year-to-year at approximately 22%.



Special Charges

Fiscal 2003 Special Charges

During the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we
recorded a special charge of $0.3 million. The charge
included a $2.0 million write-down of equipment to fair
value due to a decision to outsource the assembly of products in
plastic packages, which had been done internally at our facility
in the Philippines. This amount was the net book value of the
assets used in plastic assembly, net of proceeds received from
the sale in the third quarter of a portion of the assets. We
also decided to abandon efforts to develop a particular
expertise in optical communications that resulted in the
write-down of $2.7 million of equipment to its fair value.
During the quarter ended August 2, 2003, we determined that
costs remaining to be paid for certain restructuring charges
would be less than the amount originally recorded. Accordingly,
we recorded a change in estimate reducing the restructuring
accruals by $4.4 million related to prior restructuring
charges as more fully described below.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we
recorded a special charge of $9.2 million as a result of a
decision to close a small manufacturing facility in Belfast,
Northern Ireland that supplied foundry substrate services for
optical applications. The charge included $2.0 million of
severance and fringe benefit costs for approximately 57
manufacturing employees and 14 engineering and administrative
employees all of which had been paid by the end of the second
quarter of fiscal 2004. The charge also included $6 million
related to the write-down of property, plant and equipment to
its fair value and $1.2 million related to the write-down
of various other assets to their fair values. The closure was
completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2004.

Fiscal 2002 Special Charges

During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we
recorded special charges of approximately $27.2 million.
The second quarter charge was comprised of $25.7 million
related to the planned transfer of production from our three
older four-inch wafer fabrication facilities to our three
six-inch and one eight-inch wafer fabrication facilities, and
$3 million primarily related to the impairment of an
investment, which was partially offset by an adjustment of
$1.5 million related to equipment cancelation fees recorded
in fiscal year 2001. The investment impairment, which was
related to an equity investment in a private company, was due to
our decision to abandon the product strategy for which the
investment was made. Included in the $25.7 million special
charge were severance and fringe benefit costs of
$15.3 million for 509 manufacturing employees in the United
States and Ireland, $2.3 million related to the write-down
of equipment to be abandoned and $8.1 million of other
charges, primarily related to lease termination and cleanup
costs. The write-down of equipment was principally due to a
decision to discontinue various product development strategies.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we reversed
$2.9 million of the accrual primarily due to lower than
previously expected severance costs. The lower severance costs
were the result of a reduction in the number of separated
employees and, to a lesser extent, the average tenure of
separated employees differing from estimates. The 509 employees
projected to be terminated at the time of the original charge
was adjusted down to 439 and, as of May 1, 2004, all of the
employees had been terminated. The reduction in the number of
employees to be terminated was due to the transfer of employees,
which primarily occurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, to
positions in our six-inch wafer fabrication facilities where we
experienced an unexpected increase in demand for our products.
All the planned closure and consolidation actions related to our
four-inch wafer fabrication facilities are now complete. Since
severance costs are paid as income continuance at some
locations, these amounts will be expended over time subsequent
to the final termination of employment.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we
recorded special charges of approximately $12.8 million.
The charges included severance and fringe benefit costs of
$3.7 million related to cost reduction actions taken in
several product groups and, to a lesser extent, in
manufacturing, $3.8 million related to the impairment of an
investment, $3.4 million related to the impairment of
goodwill associated with the closing of an Austrian design
center acquired in fiscal 2001 and $1.9 million primarily
related to the abandonment of equipment and lease cancelation
fees. The investment impairment, which was related to an equity
investment in a private company, was due to our decision to
abandon the product strategy for which the investment was made.
The severance and fringe benefit costs were for approximately 70
engineering employees in the United States,



Europe and Canada, and approximately 30
manufacturing employees in the United States, all of whom had
been terminated as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal
2004.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we
recorded special charges of approximately $8.4 million. The
charges included severance and fringe benefit costs of
$2.5 million related to cost reduction actions taken in the
sales group, several product groups and our manufacturing test
operations for approximately 65 employees in the United States
and Europe, all of whom had been terminated as of
November 1, 2003. The charges also included
$2.1 million related to the impairment of investments,
$1.8 million primarily related to the abandonment of
equipment and lease cancelation fees and a change in estimate of
$2.0 million for additional estimated cleanup costs
originally recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2002. The
investment impairment charges were related to the decline in
fair value of a publicly traded equity investment to less than
its cost basis that was determined to be other-than-temporary,
and to an equity investment in a private company. The private
company equity investment was part of a product strategy that we
decided to abandon.

Fiscal 2001 Special Charges

During fiscal 2001, we recorded special charges
of approximately $47 million related to cost reduction
actions taken in response to the economic climate at that time.
The actions consisted of workforce reductions in manufacturing
and, to a lesser extent, in selling, marketing and
administrative areas as well as a decision to consolidate
worldwide manufacturing operations and rationalize production
planning and quality activities. The cost reductions included
severance and fringe benefit costs of $29.6 million for
approximately 1,200 employees in the United States, Europe, Asia
and the Philippines, all of whom had been terminated as of
January 31, 2004. The special charges also included
$11.6 million related to the abandonment of equipment
resulting from the consolidation of worldwide manufacturing
operations and $5.8 million of other charges primarily
related to equipment and lease cancelation fees. Based on the
results of negotiations with vendors regarding purchase order
cancelation fees, the amount paid was $1.5 million less
than the amount recorded for such charges and, accordingly, we
adjusted the provision for purchase order cancelation fees by
$1.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 to
reflect this change in estimate. In the third quarter of fiscal
2003, we determined that the severance costs remaining to be
paid would be $1.3 million less than the amount originally
recorded for these charges and also determined that
$0.2 million originally reserved for the termination of two
leases would not be required. Therefore, we adjusted the
provision for these severance and other costs in the third
quarter of fiscal 2003 to reflect this change in estimate.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, or FASB, issued Financial Accounting Standards
Board Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46),

Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities,

and amended it by issuing
FIN 46R in December 2003. FIN 46R requires that
if an entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable
interest entity, the assets, liabilities and results of
activities of the variable interest entity should be included in
the consolidated financial statements of the entity. Because we
do not have any variable interest entities, the adoption of
FIN 46R in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 did not have
any effect on our financial position or results of operations.

In December 2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 132 (Revised 2003),

Employers’
Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement
Benefits,

which enhanced the required disclosures about
pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, but did
not change the measurement or recognition principles for those
plans. The statement requires additional interim and annual
disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows and net
periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other
defined benefit postretirement plans. The required interim
disclosures were effective for us in the second quarter of
fiscal year 2004, and the required annual disclosures are
included in Note 13 to our consolidated financial
statements contained in Item 8 of this annual report on
Form 10-K.

In December 2003, the SEC issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 104,

Revenue Recognition

(SAB 104). SAB 104 updates portions of the
interpretive guidance included in Topic 13 of the
codification of Staff



Accounting Bulletins in order to make the
interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative
accounting and auditing guidance and SEC rules and regulations.
We are following the guidance of SAB 104.

In March 2004, the FASB issued EITF Issue
No. 03-1,

The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment
and Its Application to Certain Investments

, which provides
new guidance for assessing impairment losses on debt and equity
investments. Additionally, EITF Issue No. 03-1 includes new
disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be
temporarily impaired. In September 2004, the FASB delayed
the accounting provisions of EITF Issue No. 03-1; however,
the disclosure requirements remain effective and have been
adopted for our fiscal year ended October 30, 2004. We will
evaluate the effect, if any, of EITF Issue No. 03-1 when
final guidance is released.

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of the
financial condition and results of operations is based upon the
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. The preparation of these financial statements
requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We
base our estimates and judgments on historical experience,
knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur
in the future given available information. We consider the
following accounting policies to be both those most important to
the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require
the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ
significantly from management’s estimates and projections,
there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We
also have other policies that we consider key accounting
policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including
the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the
products are sold to the end user; however, the application of
these policies does not require us to make estimates or
judgments that are difficult or subjective.

Inventory Valuation

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost
(first-in, first-out method) or market. Because of the cyclical
nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory
levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we
write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a
variety of methodologies to determine the amount of inventory
reserves necessary. While a portion of the reserve is determined
via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or
market calculations, an element of the reserve is subject to
significant judgments made by us about future demand for our
inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our
estimates, additional reserves for existing inventories may need
to be recorded in future periods.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts,
when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from the
inability of our customers to make required payments. If the
financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our
actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional
allowances would be required.

Long-Lived Assets

We review property, plant, and equipment for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of
their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows the
assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic
life. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by
which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market
value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a
value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique.
Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments
related to our property, plant, and equipment during the past
three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with
restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the
future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future
periods. Evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires
estimates of future operating results that are used in the



preparation of the expected future undiscounted
cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining
economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the
estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets.
These differences could result in impairment charges, which
could have a material adverse impact on our results of
operations.

Goodwill

In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, or FAS 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

In the first
quarter of fiscal 2003, we adopted the new rules of FAS 142
for measuring and assessing goodwill for impairment. As required
by FAS 142, all remaining and future acquired goodwill is
subject to annual impairment tests, or earlier if indicators of
potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value
of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted
future cash flows. Because we have one reporting segment under
FAS 142, we utilize the entity-wide approach to assess
goodwill for impairment and compare our market value to our net
book value to determine if an impairment exists. These
impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have
a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Accounting for Income Taxes

We account for income taxes in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, or
FAS 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes,

which requires
that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using
enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences
between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and
liabilities. FAS 109 also requires that deferred tax assets
be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than
not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not
be realized. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax
assets quarterly. At October 30, 2004, we had gross
deferred tax assets of $144 million primarily resulting
from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of
assets and liabilities. We have conducted an assessment of the
likelihood of realization of those deferred tax assets and
concluded that a $33 million valuation allowance is needed
to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be
realized due to the expiration of state credit carryovers. In
reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria
including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be
used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior
carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses
and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding
future profitability may change due to future market conditions,
changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other
factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments
to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net
income or an increase in net loss in the period when such
determinations are made.

In addition, we have provided for potential
liabilities due in various jurisdictions. Judgment is required
in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision. In
the ordinary course of global business, there are many
transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is
uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of
cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities. Although
we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be
given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be
different than that which is reflected in our historical income
tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a
material impact on our income tax provision and operating
results in the period in which such determination is made.

Contingencies

From time to time, we receive notices that our
products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent
or intellectual property rights of others. We periodically
assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should
be recorded in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 5, or FAS 5,

Accounting for
Contingencies.

In making this determination, we may,
depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and
external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the
information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all
the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether
it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and
whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated.
Should a loss be probable and reasonably estimable, we record a
contingent loss in accordance with



FAS 5. In determining the amount of a
contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the
specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement
negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other
factors. Should the judgments and estimates made by us be
incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses
that could materially adversely impact our results of
operations. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains or
incorporates forward-looking statements within the meaning of
section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These
forward-looking statements are based on current expectations,
estimates, forecasts and projections about the industry and
markets in which we operate and management’s beliefs and
assumptions. In addition, other written or oral statements that
constitute forward-looking statements may be made by or on our
behalf. Words such as “expect,”
“anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,”
“believe,” “seek,” “estimate,”
variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to
identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are
not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks,
uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We
have included important factors in the cautionary statements
below under the heading “Factors That May Affect Future
Results” that we believe could cause our actual results to
differ materially from the forward-looking statements we make.
We do not intend to update publicly any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise.

Factors That May Affect Future
Results

Our future operating results are difficult to
predict and may materially fluctuate.

Our future operating results are difficult to
predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors,
including the timing of new product announcements or
introductions by us or our competitors, competitive pricing
pressures, fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate
availability of wafers and manufacturing capacity, the risk that
our backlog could decline significantly, our ability to hire,
retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other
qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers,
changes in product mix, and the effect of adverse changes in
economic conditions in the United States and international
markets. In addition, the semiconductor market has historically
been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns. Our
business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can
be no assurance, depending on the mix of future business, that
products stocked in inventory will not be rendered obsolete
before we ship them. As a result of these and other factors,
there can be no assurance that we will not experience material
fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or
annual basis.

Long-term contracts are not typical for us and
reductions, cancelations or delays in orders for our products
could adversely affect our operating results.

In certain markets where end-user demand may be
particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers
place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it
available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to
make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the
product. At any given time, this situation could affect a
portion of our backlog. As a result, we are subject to the risk
of cancelation of orders leading to a sharp fall-off of sales
and backlog. Further, those orders may be for products that meet
the customer’s unique requirements so that those canceled
orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable
products, resulting in potential inventory write-offs. As a
result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the
products subject to these uncertainties, the amount of
unsaleable product could be substantial. Reductions,
cancelations or delays in orders for our products could
adversely affect our operating results.

Our future success depends upon our ability to
develop and market new products and enter new markets.

Our success significantly depends on our
continued ability to develop and market new products. There can
be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce
new products in a timely manner or that new



products, if developed, will achieve market
acceptance. In addition, our growth is dependent on our
continued ability to penetrate new markets where we have limited
experience and competition is intense. There can be no assurance
that the markets we serve will grow in the future, that our
existing and new products will meet the requirements of these
markets, that our products will achieve customer acceptance in
these markets, that competitors will not force prices to an
unacceptably low level or take market share from us, or that we
can achieve or maintain profits in these markets. Furthermore, a
decline in demand in one or several of our end-user markets
could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our
products and our results of operations. Also, some of our
customers in these markets are less established, which could
subject us to increased credit risk.

We may not be able to compete successfully in
the semiconductor industry in the future.

Many other companies offer products that compete
with our products. Some have greater financial, manufacturing,
technical and marketing resources than we have. Additionally,
some formerly independent competitors have been purchased by
larger companies. Our competitors also include emerging
companies selling specialized products to markets we serve.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete
successfully in the future against existing or new competitors,
or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by
increased price competition.

We rely on third-party subcontractors and
manufacturers for some industry-standard wafers and
assembly/test services, and therefore cannot control their
availability or conditions of supply.

We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on
assembly and test subcontractors and on third-party wafer
fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be
manufactured using industry-standard submicron processes. This
reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over
delivery schedules, manufacturing yields and costs.
Additionally, we utilize third-party wafer fabricators as
sole-source suppliers, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company. These suppliers manufacture components in
accordance with our proprietary designs and specifications. We
have no written supply agreements with these sole-source
suppliers and purchase our custom components through individual
purchase orders. If these sole-source suppliers are unable or
unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of
components to us, on the time schedule and of the quality that
we require, we may be forced to seek to engage additional or
replacement suppliers, which could result in additional expenses
and delays in product development or shipment of product to our
customers.

We may not be able to satisfy increasing
demand for our products, and increased production may lead to
overcapacity and lower prices.

The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry
has resulted in sustained and short-term periods when demand for
our products has increased or decreased rapidly. During these
periods of rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may
not be sufficient to satisfy the available demand. We, and the
semiconductor industry generally, expand production facilities
and access to third-party foundries in response to these periods
of increased demand. These capacity expansions by us and other
semiconductor manufacturers could lead to overcapacity in our
target markets which could lead to price erosion that would
adversely impact our operating results.

Our revenue may not increase enough to offset
the expense of additional capacity.

We, and the semiconductor industry generally,
expand production facilities and access to third-party foundries
in response to periods of increased demand which can cause
operating expenses to increase. Should customer demand fail to
increase or should the semiconductor industry enter a period of
reduced customer demand, our financial position and results of
operations could be adversely impacted as a result of
underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges.



We may be unable to adequately protect our
proprietary rights, which may limit our ability to compete
effectively.

We rely primarily upon know-how, rather than on
patents, to develop and maintain our competitive position. There
can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent
similar technology or reverse engineer our products or that the
confidentiality agreements upon which we rely will be adequate
to protect our interests. Other companies have obtained patents
covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and
we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these
patents or be precluded from making and selling the infringing
products, if such patents are found to be valid. There can be no
assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses, if required,
upon commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Moreover, the
laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture and
market our products may afford little or no effective protection
of our proprietary technology.

We are involved in frequent litigation
regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly to
defend and could require us to redesign products or pay
significant royalties.

There can be no assurance that any patent will
issue on pending applications or that any patent issued will
provide substantive protection for the technology or product
covered by it. We believe that patent and mask set protection is
of less significance in our business than experience, innovation
and management skill. There also can be no assurance that others
will not develop or patent similar technology, or reverse
engineer our products, or that our confidentiality agreements
with employees, consultants, silicon foundries and other
suppliers and vendors will be adequate to protect our interests.

The semiconductor industry is characterized by
frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other
intellectual property rights, including claims arising under our
contractual indemnification of our customers. We have received
from time to time, and may receive in the future, claims from
third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe
their patents or other intellectual property rights. In the
event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim
against us and a license is not available to us on commercially
reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to
redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that
intellectual property, and our operating results could be
materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary
to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property
rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this
litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key
personnel. See Note 11 in the Notes to our Consolidated
Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K for information concerning pending
litigation that involves us. An adverse outcome in this or other
litigation could have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results
of operations or cash flows in the period in which the
litigation is resolved.

If we do not retain our key personnel, our
ability to execute our business strategy will be
limited.

Our success depends to a significant extent upon
the continued service of our executive officers and key
management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced
engineers, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain,
and motivate qualified personnel. The competition for these
employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or more of
our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our
operating results. In addition, there could be a material
adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and
other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable
to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do not maintain
any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or
employees.

We rely on manufacturing capacity located in
geologically unstable areas, which could affect the availability
of supplies and services.

We, and many companies in the semiconductor
industry, rely on internal manufacturing capacity located in
California as well as wafer fabrication foundries in Taiwan and
other sub-contractors in geologically unstable locations around
the world. This reliance involves risks associated with the
impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry,
including temporary loss of capacity, availability and cost of
key raw materials and equipment and availability of key services
including transport. In addition, California has



experienced intermittent interruption in the
availability of electricity. To date, the impact on us has been
negligible. However, electricity is a critical resource for us,
without which our products could not be manufactured at
factories exposed to continued lengthy power interruptions. Any
prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing
facilities as a result of fire, natural disaster, unavailability
of electric power or otherwise, would have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

We are exposed to economic, political and
other risks through our significant worldwide
operations.

During fiscal year 2004, approximately 75% of our
revenues were derived from customers in international markets.
Although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our
exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no
assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely
affected by changes in the exchange rate of the United States
dollar against other currencies. Potential interest rate
increases, particularly in the United States and China, as well
as high energy costs could have an adverse impact on industrial
and consumer spending patterns and could adversely impact demand
for our products. We have manufacturing facilities outside the
United States in Ireland and the Philippines. In addition to
being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the
semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic and
political risks inherent in international operations and their
impact on the United States economy in general, including the
risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and
economic instability in many countries around the world as well
as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism, and the
response to them by the United States and its allies. These
risks include air transportation disruptions, expropriation,
currency controls, currency exchange rate movement, and
additional costs related to tax, tariff and freight rate
increases.

Our future operating results are dependent on
the performance of independent distributors and sales
representatives.

A significant portion of our sales are through
independent distributors that are not under our control. These
independent distributors generally represent product lines
offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales
efforts applied to our products or terminate their
representation of us. We generally do not require letters of
credit from our distributors and are not protected against
accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors.
Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could
adversely affect our results of operations. Termination of a
significant distributor, whether at our initiative or the
distributor’s initiative, could disrupt our current
business. If we are unable to find suitable replacements in the
event of terminations by significant distributors or sales
representatives, our operating results could be adversely
affected.

Our manufacturing processes are highly complex
and may be interrupted.

We have manufacturing processes that utilize a
substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of
integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process.
Minute impurities, contaminants in the manufacturing
environment, difficulties in the fabrication process, defects in
the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process, manufacturing
equipment failures, wafer breakage or other factors can cause a
substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice
on each wafer to be nonfunctional. While we have significant
expertise in semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that
some processes could become unstable. This instability could
result in manufacturing delays and product shortages, which
could have a material adverse effect on our financial position
or results of operations.

ITEM
7A.     QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Exposure

Our annual interest income would change by
approximately $19 million in fiscal 2004 and
$29 million in fiscal 2003 for each 100 basis point
increase or decrease in interest rates. The fair values of our
investment portfolio at October 30, 2004 would change by
approximately $24 million for each 100 basis point
increase or decrease in rates. The fair values of our investment
portfolio at November 1, 2003 would not be significantly



impacted by either an increase or decrease in
interest rates primarily due to the short-term nature of a major
portion of our investment portfolio.

Foreign Currency Exposure

As more fully described in Note 2
(i) in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements
contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K, we regularly hedge our
non-U.S. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward
exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods
matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally
range from one month to six months. The short-term nature of
these contracts has resulted in these instruments having
insignificant fair values at October 30, 2004 and
November 1, 2003. Currently, our largest foreign currency
exposure is against the Euro, primarily because Europe has a
higher proportion of our local currency denominated expenses.
Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at
October 30, 2004 and November 1, 2003, a 10%
unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would
not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows or
significantly diminish the fair value of our foreign currency
financial instruments, primarily due to the short lives of the
affected financial instruments that effectively hedge
substantially all of our year-end exposures against fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates. The calculation assumes that
each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative
to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of
changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the
volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as
competitors’ products become more or less attractive. Our
sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign
currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in
sales levels or local currency selling prices.

Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

a.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and all of its wholly owned
subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all intercompany accounts and
transactions are eliminated. The Company’s fiscal year ends
on the 52-week or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest
to the last day in October. Fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002
were 52-week years.

Certain amounts reported in previous years have
been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2004 presentation.
Such reclassifications were immaterial.

b.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term
    Investments

Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid
investments with insignificant interest rate risk and maturities
of three months or less at the time of acquisition. Cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of
corporate obligations such as commercial paper and corporate
bonds, and Treasury and government agency notes and bonds. They
also include bank time deposits, institutional money market
funds and taxable municipal bonds.

The Company classifies its investments in readily
marketable debt and equity securities as
“held-to-maturity,” “available-for-sale” or
“trading” at the time of purchase. There were no
transfers between investment classifications in any of the
periods presented. Held-to-maturity securities, which are
carried at amortized cost, include only those securities the
Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity.
Securities, such as bank time deposits, which by their nature
are typically held to maturity, are classified as such. The
Company’s other readily marketable investments are
classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities
are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net
of related tax, if any, reported in accumulated other
comprehensive income, which is a separate component of
stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses, as well as
interest, and dividends on all securities, are included in
earnings.

The Company’s short-term investments are
adjusted to fair value at the end of each quarter. These
adjustments to fair value are recorded as an increase or
decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income. No realized
gains or losses were recorded during any period presented.



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company periodically evaluates these
investments for impairment in accordance with EITF Issue
No. 03-01,

The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments.

When
a decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary,
the Company records an impairment adjustment in the statement of
income. There were no other-than-temporary impairments of
short-term investments in any of the fiscal years presented.

Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale
marketable securities were as follows:

There were no unrealized gains and losses on
held-to-maturity investments in any of the fiscal years
presented.

There were no cash equivalents or short-term
investments classified as trading at October 30, 2004 and
November 1, 2003. All of the Company’s short-term
investments were classified as available-for-sale. The
components of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments as of October 30, 2004 and
November 1, 2003 were as follows:



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

c.     Supplemental
    Cash Flow Statement Information

The Company’s primary non-cash financing
activities in fiscal 2004 resulted from the Company’s 2001
acquisitions for which 1,462,066 shares of common stock
were issued (valued at approximately $81.8 million) and
unvested stock options with an intrinsic value of approximately
$11.9 million were assumed. As a result, the Company
recognized approximately $6.1 million of stock-based
compensation expense in both fiscal 2004 and 2003. The
Company’s primary non-cash financing activities in fiscal
2003 were the result of the restructuring of an interest rate
swap in October 2002 (see Note 2i.). At the time of the
restructuring of the swap, the fair value of the interest rate
component of the debt was greater than the related carrying
value. This difference was amortized over the remaining life of
the swap as an adjustment to interest expense. As a result, the
Company recognized $7.5 million of expense in fiscal year
2003. The Company’s primary non-cash financing activities
in fiscal 2002 were a result of fiscal 2001 acquisitions. The
Company recognized approximately $11.1 million of
stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2002.

d.     Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost
(first-in, first-out method) or market. Inventories at
October 30, 2004 and November 1, 2003 were as follows:

e.     Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost
less allowances for depreciation. The straight-line method of
depreciation is used for all classes of assets for financial
statement purposes; both straight-line and accelerated methods
are used for income tax purposes. Capitalized leases and
leasehold improvements are amortized based upon the lesser of
the term of the lease or the useful life of the asset.
Depreciation and amortization are based on the following useful
lives:

Buildings & Building Equipment

Up to 25 years

Machinery & Equipment

3-10 years

Office Equipment

3-8 years

Total depreciation of property, plant and
equipment was $150 million, $166 million, and
$181 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Property, plant and equipment included $73 million and
$77 million of capitalized leases in fiscal 2004 and fiscal
2003, net of $70 million and $72 million,
respectively, of accumulated depreciation. The Company did not
capitalize interest in fiscal 2003 or 2004. The Company recorded
$1.7 million of capitalized interest in fiscal 2002.

The Company reviews property, plant, and
equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may
not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured
by comparison of their carrying amount to the future
undiscounted cash flows the assets are



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

expected to generate over their remaining
economic life. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by
which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market
value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a
value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique.

f.

Goodwill and Other Acquisition-related
    Intangibles

Beginning in fiscal 2003, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142
(FAS 142),

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

As
a result, the Company discontinued amortizing the remaining
balances of goodwill effective November 3, 2002. Instead,
the Company annually evaluates goodwill for impairment as well
as whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable from estimated discounted
future cash flows. Because the Company has one reporting segment
under FAS 142, the Company utilizes the entity-wide
approach for assessing goodwill for impairment and compares its
market value to its net book value to determine if an impairment
exists. No impairment of goodwill resulted from the
Company’s evaluation of goodwill in any of the years
presented.

Other intangible assets, which will continue to
be amortized, consisted of the following:

Intangible assets’ lives range from five to
ten years and are amortized on the straight-line basis over
their useful lives. Amortization expense relating to goodwill
and other acquisition-related intangibles was:

The Company expects annual amortization expense
for these intangible assets to be:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following table provides a reconciliation of
reported net income to adjusted net income had FAS 142 been
applied as of the beginning of fiscal 2002:

g.

Grant Accounting

The Company’s manufacturing facility in
Limerick, Ireland has received various grants from the
Industrial Development Authority of the Republic of Ireland.
These grants include capital, employment and research and
development grants. Capital grants for the acquisition of
property and equipment are netted against the related capital
expenditures and amortized as a credit to depreciation expense
over the useful life of the related asset. Employment grants,
which relate to employee hiring and training, and research and
development grants are recognized in earnings in the period in
which the related expenditures are incurred by the Company.

h.

Translation of Foreign
    Currencies

The functional currency for the Company’s
foreign sales operations is the applicable local currency. Gains
and losses resulting from translation of these foreign
currencies into U.S. dollars are recorded in accumulated
other comprehensive income. Transaction gains and losses and
remeasurement of foreign currency denominated assets and
liabilities are included in income currently, including those at
the Company’s principal foreign manufacturing operations
where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Foreign
currency transaction gains or losses included in other expenses,
net, were not material in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002.

i.     Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Agreements

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange
contracts to offset certain operational and balance sheet
exposures from the impact of changes in foreign currency
exchange rates. Such exposures result from the portion of the
Company’s operations, assets and liabilities that are
denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar,
primarily Japanese Yen, Euro, and British Pounds Sterling. These
foreign exchange contracts are entered into to support product
sales, purchases and financing transactions made in the normal
course of business, and accordingly, are not speculative in
nature.

The Company records all derivative financial
instruments in the consolidated financial statements at fair
value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the
instrument. Changes in the fair value of the derivative
financial instruments are either recognized periodically in
earnings or in stockholders’ equity as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) depending on
whether the derivative financial instrument



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

qualifies for hedge accounting as defined by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133
(FAS 133),

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities.

Changes in fair values of derivatives
not qualifying for hedge accounting are reported in earnings as
they occur.

Foreign Exchange Exposure
Management

— The Company has
significant international sales and purchase transactions in
foreign currencies and has a policy of hedging forecasted and
actual foreign currency risk with forward foreign exchange
contracts. The Company’s forward foreign exchange contracts
are denominated in Japanese Yen, British Pounds Sterling and the
Euro and are for periods consistent with the terms of the
underlying transactions, generally one year or less. Derivative
instruments are employed to eliminate or minimize certain
foreign currency exposures that can be confidently identified
and quantified. In accordance with FAS 133, hedges related
to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the
inception of the respective hedges as cash flow hedges and are
evaluated for effectiveness monthly. As the terms of the
contract and the underlying transaction are matched at
inception, forward contract effectiveness is calculated by
comparing the change in fair value of the contract to the change
in the forward value of the anticipated transaction, with the
effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative
instrument reported as a component of OCI in stockholders’
equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period during
which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any residual
change in fair value of the instruments, or ineffectiveness, is
recognized immediately in other income/expense. No
ineffectiveness was recognized in fiscal 2004, 2003 or 2002.

Additionally, the Company enters into forward
foreign currency contracts that economically hedge the gains and
losses generated by the remeasurement of certain recorded assets
and liabilities in a non-functional currency. Changes in the
fair value of these undesignated hedges are recognized in other
income/expense immediately as an offset to the changes in the
fair value of the asset or liability being hedged.

Interest Rate Exposure
Management

— In the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company terminated a swap agreement
that had the effect of swapping the 4.75% fixed rate of the
Company’s Convertible Subordinated Notes (the
“Notes”) into a LIBOR-based floating rate. The swap
was terminated due to the Company’s decision to call for
the redemption of the Notes (see Note 8). The terminated
swap was originally entered into in January 2002 and hedged the
benchmark interest rate of the $1,200 million Notes. The
swap was a derivative instrument as defined by FAS 133 and
was designated as a fair value hedge at inception. As the
critical terms of the interest rate swap and the underlying
interest component of the Company’s Notes were matched at
inception, effectiveness was calculated by comparing the change
in the fair value of the contract to the change in the fair
value of the interest rate component, with the effective portion
of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument reported in
other income/expense. The Company evaluated this fair value
hedge for effectiveness quarterly, and restructured certain
terms in October 2002 to provide for an even more highly
effective hedge relationship with the Notes. The restructuring
resulted in an interest rate swap with terms more favorable to
the Company, offset by a promise to pay a fixed amount over time
to the counterparty regardless of when the swap was terminated.
The restructuring, which had no impact on earnings, increased
the interest rate swap asset by $27 million, with an
offsetting debt liability of an equal amount. The fair value
hedge was determined to be highly effective during each quarter,
and a minor amount of ineffectiveness was recorded in other
income/expense during fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2002.

Derivative financial instruments involve, to a
varying degree, elements of market and credit risk not
recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The market
risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency
exchange rate or interest rate movements is expected to offset
the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and
liabilities being hedged. The counterparties to the agreements
relating to the Company’s foreign exchange and interest
rate instruments consist of a number of major international
financial institutions with high credit ratings. The Company
does not believe that there is significant risk of
nonperformance by these counterparties because the Company
continually monitors the credit ratings of such counterparties,
and limits the financial exposure with any one financial
institution. While the contract or



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

notional amounts of derivative financial
instruments provide one measure of the volume of these
transactions, they do not represent the amount of the
Company’s exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially
subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of
counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are
generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the
counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed the
obligations of the Company to the counterparties.

Accumulated Derivative Gains or
Losses

The following table summarizes activity in other
comprehensive income related to derivatives classified as cash
flow hedges held by the Company during the period of
November 3, 2002 through October 30, 2004:

All of the accumulated gain will be reclassified
into earnings over the next twelve months.

j.

Fair Values of Financial
    Instruments

The following estimated fair value amounts have
been determined by the Company using available market
information and appropriate valuation methodologies. The
estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the
amounts that the Company could realize in a current market
exchange.

The following methods and assumptions were used
by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for
financial instruments:

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments

— These
investments, except those classified as held-to-maturity, which
are carried at amortized cost, are adjusted to fair value based
on quoted market values.

Deferred compensation plan investments and
other investments

— The
fair value of these investments is based on quoted market
values, with the exception of private-company equity investments
that are carried at cost.



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Interest rate swap and cap
agreements

— The fair
value of interest rate swap and cap agreements is obtained from
dealer quotes. These values represent the estimated amount the
Company would receive or pay to terminate the agreements taking
into consideration current interest rates.

Forward foreign currency exchange
contracts

— The
estimated fair value of forward foreign currency exchange
contracts is based on the estimated amount at which they could
be settled based on forward market exchange rates.

k.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates relate to
the useful lives of fixed assets, allowances for doubtful
accounts and customer returns, the net realizable value of
inventory, potential reserves relating to litigation matters,
accrued liabilities, accrued taxes, deferred tax valuation
allowances and other reserves. Actual results could differ from
those estimates, and such differences may be material to the
financial statements.

l.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally
of investments and trade accounts receivable.

The Company maintains cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments and long-term investments with high
credit quality financial institutions and monitors the amount of
credit exposure to any one financial institution.

The Company sells its products to distributors
and original equipment manufacturers involved in a variety of
industries including industrial process automation,
instrumentation, defense/aerospace, automotive, communications,
computers and computer peripherals and consumer electronics. The
Company has adopted credit policies and standards to accommodate
growth in these markets. The Company performs continuing credit
evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and
although the Company generally does not require collateral,
letters of credit may be required from its customers in certain
circumstances. Reserves are provided for estimated amounts of
accounts receivable that may not be collected.

m.

Concentration of Other Risks

The semiconductor industry is characterized by
rapid technological change, competitive pricing pressures and
cyclical market patterns. The Company’s financial results
are affected by a wide variety of factors, including general
economic conditions worldwide, economic conditions specific to
the semiconductor industry, the timely implementation of new
manufacturing technologies, the ability to safeguard patents and
intellectual property in a rapidly evolving market and reliance
on assembly and test subcontractors, third-party wafer
fabricators and independent distributors. In addition, the
semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject
to significant economic downturns at various times. The Company
is exposed to the risk of obsolescence of its inventory
depending on the mix of future business. As a result, the
Company may experience significant period-to-period fluctuations
in future operating results due to the factors mentioned above
or other factors.

n.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue and the related cost of sales on
shipments to distributors are deferred until the distributors
resell the products to end-users. Deferred amounts are presented
net and included as “Deferred income on



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

shipments to distributors” in the
Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Revenue from product
sales to end-users is recognized when title passes, which for
shipments to certain foreign countries is subsequent to product
shipment. Title for these shipments ordinarily passes within a
week of shipment. A reserve for sales returns and allowances for
customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific
identification of an event necessitating a reserve.

Shipping costs are charged to cost of sales as
incurred.

The Company generally offers a 12-month warranty
for its products. The Company’s warranty policy provides
for replacement of the defective product. Specific accruals are
recorded for known product warranty issues. Product warranty
expenses during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 were not material.

o.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive
    Income

Other comprehensive income includes certain
transactions that have generally been reported in the
consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity. Accumulated
other comprehensive income is comprised of currency translation
adjustments, minimum pension liability adjustments, unrealized
gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities, and net gain or
loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges.

The components of accumulated other comprehensive
income at October 30, 2004 and November 1, 2003
consisted of the following:

p.

Advertising Expense

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
Advertising expense was $11.9 million in fiscal 2004,
$12.1 million in fiscal 2003 and $9.0 million in
fiscal 2002.

q.

Income Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on the differences between financial reporting
and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using
the enacted income tax rates and laws that are expected to be in
effect when the temporary differences are expected to reverse.
Additionally, deferred tax assets and liabilities are separated
into current and noncurrent amounts based on the classification
of the related assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes.

r.

Earnings Per Share of Common
    Stock

Basic earnings per share is computed based only
on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period, plus the dilutive effect of potential future
issuances of common stock relating to stock option programs and
other potentially dilutive securities. In calculating diluted
earnings per share, the dilutive effect of stock options is
computed using the average market price for the respective
period. Potential shares related to convertible debt and certain
of the Company’s outstanding stock options were excluded
because they were anti-dilutive. Those potential shares related
to the Company’s outstanding



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

stock options could be dilutive in the future.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and
diluted earnings per share:

s.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company adopted the disclosure requirements
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148
(FAS 148),

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure

effective
November 3, 2002. FAS 148 amends Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (FAS 123),

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,

to provide
alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the
fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation and
also amends the disclosure requirements of FAS 123 to
require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim
financial statements about the methods of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method
used on reported results. As permitted by FAS 148 and
FAS 123, the Company continues to apply the accounting
provisions of Accounting Principle Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,

and related
interpretations, with regard to the measurement of compensation
cost for options granted under the Company’s equity
compensation plans, consisting of the 2001 Broad-Based Stock
Option Plan, the 1998 Stock Option Plan, the Restated
1994 Director Option Plan, the Restated 1988 Stock Option
Plan, the 1992 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the 1998
International Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

Pro forma information regarding net income and
earnings per share is required by FAS 123 for awards
granted after October 28, 1995 as if the Company had
accounted for its stock-based awards to employees under the fair
value method of FAS 123. The fair value of the
Company’s stock-based awards to employees was estimated
using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting
restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option
valuation models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility.
Because the Company’s stock-based awards to employees have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions
can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
management’s opinion, the existing models do not
necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value
of its stock-based awards to employees. The fair

value of the Company’s stock-based awards to
employees was estimated using the following weighted average
assumptions.

The following is a summary of weighted average
grant date values generated by application of the Black-Scholes
model:

Had expense been recognized using the fair value
method described in FAS 123, using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model, the Company would have reported the
following results of operations:

The effects of applying FAS 123 on pro forma
disclosures are not likely to be representative of the effects
on pro forma disclosures of future years.

New Accounting Standards

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, or FASB, issued Financial Accounting Standards
Board Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46),

Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities,

and amended it by issuing
FIN 46R in December 2003. FIN 46R requires that if an
entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable
interest entity, the assets, liabilities and results of
activities of the variable interest entity should be included in
the consolidated financial statements of the entity. Because the
Company does not have any variable interest entities, the
adoption of FIN 46R in the second quarter of fiscal 2004
did not have any effect on the Company’s financial position
or results of operations.

In December 2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 132 (Revised 2003),

Employers’
Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement
Benefits,

which enhanced the required disclosures about
pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, but did
not change the measurement or recognition principles for those
plans. The statement requires additional interim and annual
disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flow, and net
periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other
defined benefit postretirement plans. The required interim
disclosures were effective for the Company in the second quarter
of fiscal year 2004, and the required annual disclosures are
included in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

In December 2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 104,

Revenue Recognition

(SAB 104). SAB 104 updates portions of the
interpretive guidance included in Topic 13 of the codification
of Staff Accounting Bulletins in order to make the interpretive
guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and
auditing guidance and SEC rules and regulations. The Company
follows the guidance of SAB 104.

In March 2004, the FASB issued EITF Issue
No. 03-1,

The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment
and Its Application to Certain Investments,

which provides
new guidance for assessing impairment losses on debt and equity
investments. Additionally, EITF Issue No. 03-1 includes new
disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be
temporarily impaired. In September 2004, the FASB delayed the
accounting provisions of EITF Issue No. 03-1; however, the
disclosure requirements remain effective and have been adopted
for the Company’s fiscal year ended October 30, 2004.
The Company will evaluate the effect, if any, of EITF Issue
No. 03-1 when final guidance is released.

A summary of the activity in accrued
restructuring is as follows:

Fiscal 2003
Special Charges

During the third quarter of fiscal 2003, the
Company recorded a special charge of $0.3 million. The
charge included a $2.0 million write-down of equipment to
fair value due to a decision to outsource the assembly of
products in plastic packages, which had been done internally at
the Company’s facility in the Philippines. This amount was
the net book value of the assets used in plastic assembly, net
of proceeds received from the sale in the third quarter of a
portion of the assets. The Company also decided to abandon
efforts to develop a particular expertise in optical
communications that resulted in the write-down of
$2.7 million of equipment to its fair value. During the
quarter ended August 2, 2003, the Company determined that
costs remaining to be paid for certain restructuring charges
would be less than the amount originally recorded. Accordingly,
the Company recorded a change in estimate reducing the
restructuring accruals by $4.4 million related to prior
restructuring charges as more fully described below.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, the
Company recorded a special charge of $9.2 million as a
result of a decision to close a small manufacturing facility in
Belfast, Northern Ireland that supplied foundry substrate
services for optical applications. The charge included
$2.0 million of severance and fringe benefit costs for
approximately 57 manufacturing employees and 14 engineering
and administrative employees all of which had been paid by the
end of the second quarter of fiscal 2004. The charge also
included $6 million related to the write-down of property,
plant and equipment to its fair value and $1.2 million
related to the write-down of various other assets to their fair
values. The closure was completed during the second quarter of
fiscal 2004.



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Fiscal 2002
Special Charges

During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, the
Company recorded special charges of approximately
$27.2 million. The second quarter charge was comprised of
$25.7 million related to the planned transfer of production
from the Company’s three older four-inch wafer fabrication
facilities to the Company’s three six-inch and one
eight-inch wafer fabrication facilities, and $3 million
primarily related to the impairment of an investment, which was
partially offset by an adjustment of $1.5 million related
to equipment cancelation fees recorded in fiscal year 2001. The
investment impairment, which was related to an equity investment
in a private company, was due to the Company’s decision to
abandon the product strategy for which the investment was made.
Included in the $25.7 million special charge were severance
and fringe benefit costs of $15.3 million for 509
manufacturing employees in the United States and Ireland,
$2.3 million related to the write-down of equipment to be
abandoned and $8.1 million of other charges, primarily
related to lease termination and cleanup costs. The write-down
of equipment was principally due to a decision to discontinue
various product development strategies. In the third quarter of
fiscal 2003, the Company reversed $2.9 million of the
accrual primarily due to lower than previously expected
severance costs. The lower severance costs were the result of a
reduction in the number of separated employees and, to a lesser
extent, the average tenure of separated employees differing from
estimates. The 509 employees projected to be terminated at the
time of the original charge was adjusted down to 439 and, as of
May 1, 2004, all of the employees had been terminated. The
reduction in the number of employees to be terminated was due to
the transfer of employees, which primarily occurred in the third
quarter of fiscal 2003, to positions in the Company’s
six-inch wafer fabrication facilities where the Company
experienced an unexpected increase in demand for its products.
All the planned closure and consolidation actions related to the
Company’s four-inch wafer fabrication facilities are now
complete. Since severance costs are paid as income continuance
at some locations, these amounts will be expended over time
subsequent to the final termination of employment.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, the
Company recorded special charges of approximately
$12.8 million. The charges included severance and fringe
benefit costs of $3.7 million related to cost reduction
actions taken in several product groups and, to a lesser extent,
in manufacturing, $3.8 million related to the impairment of
an investment, $3.4 million related to the impairment of
goodwill associated with the closing of an Austrian design
center acquired in fiscal 2001 and $1.9 million primarily
related to the abandonment of equipment and lease cancelation
fees. The investment impairment, which was related to an equity
investment in a private company, was due to the Company’s
decision to abandon the product strategy for which the
investment was made. The severance and fringe benefit costs were
for approximately 70 engineering employees in the United
States, Europe and Canada, and approximately
30 manufacturing employees in the United States, all of
whom had been terminated as of the end of the second quarter of
fiscal 2004.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, the
Company recorded special charges of approximately
$8.4 million. The charges included severance and fringe
benefit costs of $2.5 million related to cost reduction
actions taken in the sales group, several product groups and the
Company’s manufacturing test operations for approximately
65 employees in the United States and Europe, all of whom had
been terminated as of November 1, 2003. The charges also
included $2.1 million related to the impairment of
investments, $1.8 million primarily related to the
abandonment of equipment and lease cancelation fees and a change
in estimate of $2.0 million for additional estimated
cleanup costs originally recorded in the second quarter of
fiscal 2002. The investment impairment charges were related to
the decline in fair value of a publicly traded equity investment
to less than its cost basis that was determined to be
other-than-temporary, and to an equity investment in a private
company. The private company equity investment was part of a
product strategy that the Company decided to abandon.

Fiscal 2001 Special Charges

During fiscal 2001, the Company recorded special
charges of approximately $47 million related to cost
reduction actions taken in response to the economic climate at
that time. The actions consisted of workforce reductions in
manufacturing and, to a lesser extent, in selling, marketing and
administrative areas as well as a decision to consolidate
worldwide manufacturing operations and rationalize production
planning and quality activities. The cost reductions included
severance and fringe benefit costs of $29.6 million for
approximately 1,200 employees in the United States, Europe, Asia
and the Philippines, all of whom had been terminated as of
January 31, 2004. The special charges also included
$11.6 million related to the abandonment of equipment
resulting from the consolidation of worldwide manufacturing
operations and $5.8 million of other charges primarily
related to equipment and lease cancelation fees. Based on the
results of negotiations with vendors regarding purchase order
cancelation fees, the amount paid was $1.5 million less
than the amount recorded for such charges and, accordingly, the
Company adjusted the provision for purchase order cancelation
fees by $1.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2002
to reflect this change in estimate. In the third quarter of
fiscal 2003, the Company determined that the severance costs
remaining to be paid would be $1.3 million less than the
amount originally recorded for these charges and also determined
that $0.2 million originally reserved for the termination
of two leases would not be required. Therefore, the Company
adjusted the provision for these severance and other costs in
the third quarter of fiscal 2003 to reflect this change in
estimate.

Deferred Compensation Plan
    Investments

Deferred compensation plan investments are
classified as trading and the components of the investments as
of October 30, 2004 and November 1, 2003 were as
follows:

The fair values of these investments are based on
published market quotes on October 30, 2004 and
November 1, 2003, respectively. Adjustments to fair value
of, and income pertaining to, deferred compensation plan
investments are recorded in operating income/expense. Gross
realized and unrealized gains and losses from trading securities
were not material in fiscal 2004, fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002.

Investments are offset by a corresponding
noncurrent liability to the plan participants (see Note 9).
These investments are specifically designated as available to
the Company solely for the purpose of paying benefits under the
Company’s deferred compensation plan. However, in the event
the Company became insolvent, the investments would be available
to all unsecured general creditors.

6.

Other Investments

Other investments consist of equity securities
and other long-term investments. Investments are stated at fair
value, which is based on market quotes, interest rates or
management estimates, as appropriate. Adjustments to fair value
of investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded as
an increase or decrease in accumulated other comprehensive
income, unless the adjustment is considered an
other-than-temporary impairment, in which case the adjustment is
expensed in the statement of income.

Realized losses of $1.7 million were
recorded in fiscal 2004. There were no realized gains or losses
recorded in fiscal 2003. Realized losses of $6.9 million
were recorded in fiscal 2002.



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Unrealized gains of $1.8 million
($1.2 million net of tax) were recorded in fiscal 2004,
unrealized gains of $4.2 million ($2.7 million net of
tax) were recorded in fiscal 2003 and unrealized losses of
$1.1 million ($0.7 million net of tax) were recorded
in fiscal 2002. The unrealized loss recorded in fiscal 2002
related to an other-than-temporary impairment, therefore, this
adjustment was included in other expense in fiscal 2002.

Long-term investments classified as
available-for-sale were approximately $3.9 million and
$37.6 million at October 30, 2004 and November 1,
2003, respectively.

7.

Accrued Liabilities

Accrued liabilities at October 30, 2004 and
November 1, 2003 consisted of the following:

8.

Debt and Credit Facilities

The Company had no debt or short-term borrowings
outstanding at October 30, 2004 and November 1, 2003.

On October 1, 2003, the Company redeemed its
$1,200 million 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes
(Notes), which were due in October 2005 but allowed for early
redemption. The redemption price was 101.90% of the principal
amount of the Notes or $1,223 million. The Company
recognized a net loss on debt extinguishment of
$0.2 million in fiscal 2003, which was comprised of a gain
on the Notes redemption of $10.8 million due to the
carrying value of the Notes being greater than the redemption
value as a result of the mark-to-market of the interest rate
component, which was being hedged by an interest rate swap
agreement, of the Notes to fair value. This gain was offset by a
write-off of $11.0 million of deferred financing fees. This
net loss is included in fiscal 2003 in Other, net in the
consolidated statements of income.

9.

Deferred Compensation Plan Liability and Other
    Noncurrent Liabilities

The deferred compensation plan liability relates
to obligations due under the Analog Devices, Inc. Deferred
Compensation Plan (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”).
The Deferred Compensation Plan allows certain members of
management and other highly-compensated employees and
non-employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of
their compensation and gains on stock options and restricted
stock granted before July 23, 1997. The balance represents
Deferred Compensation Plan participant accumulated deferrals,
and earnings thereon, since the inception of the Deferred
Compensation Plan, net of withdrawals. The total expense to the
Company of the Deferred Compensation Plan was $15.9 million
in fiscal 2004, $17.8 million in fiscal 2003 and
$20.1 million in fiscal 2002. The Company’s liability
under the Deferred Compensation Plan is an unsecured general
obligation of the Company. The other items included in other
noncurrent liabilities primarily relate to pension liabilities.

10.

Lease Commitments

The Company leases certain of its facilities and
equipment under various operating leases that expire at various
dates through 2015. The lease agreements frequently include
renewal and escalation clauses and require the Company to pay
taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. Total rental expense
under operating leases was approximately $20 million in
fiscal 2004, and $21 million in both fiscal 2003 and fiscal
2002.

Commitments and Contingencies

Litigation

On June 17, 2002, the Company received a
letter from Plasma Physics Corporation (“Plasma
Physics”) attaching a courtesy copy of a complaint it had
filed against the Company in the Eastern District of New York
alleging infringement by certain of the Company’s products
of two patents held by Plasma Physics. In the letter, Plasma
Physics indicated that it would like to license the patents to
the Company. The letter further stated that Plasma Physics would
forego service of the complaint for a period of 120 days,
provided that the Company would agree to undertake negotiations
over terms for licensing the above-referenced patents. On
October 17, 2002, Plasma Physics served the complaint.
Analog has answered the complaint denying the allegations. The
case is proceeding through discovery and the ultimate outcome is
unknown.

On March 4, 2003, Motorola, Inc. filed an
action in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Texas against the Company, alleging that the Company
infringed five patents owned by Motorola relating to
semiconductor processing and semiconductor chip design. On
March 11, 2003, Motorola filed a first amended complaint
asserting the same five patents. The first amended complaint
sought injunctive relief and unspecified damages. On
April 17, 2003, the Company filed a motion under the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for a more definite statement
of Motorola’s allegations. Motorola opposed that motion,
and, by order dated July 18, 2003, the Court denied the
Company’s motion. On August 5, 2003, the Company filed
an answer and also counterclaimed against Motorola. In the
counterclaim, the Company asserted that Motorola infringed six
of the Company’s patents relating to semiconductor
technology. Motorola responded to the Company’s
counterclaims on September 10, 2003. In 2004, a subsidiary
of Motorola, Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., joined the case as a
plaintiff and counterclaim-defendant. The parties have reached a
settlement of the case, and on September 1, 2004 all claims
and counterclaims were dismissed with prejudice. This settlement
did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial
position or results of operations.

On November 6, 2003, Enron Corporation
commenced a proceeding in the United States Bankruptcy Court for
the Southern District of New York. On December 1, 2003,
Enron filed an amended complaint to add the Company as a
defendant in such proceeding. The amended complaint alleges that
transfers made by Enron in satisfaction of obligations it had
under commercial paper are recoverable as preferential transfers
and fraudulent transfers and are subject to avoidance under the
United States Bankruptcy Code. It is alleged that payments made
in premature satisfaction of obligations under commercial paper
totaling approximately $20 million are recoverable from
J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc., Fleet Capital Markets, Fleet
National Bank and/or the Company. The Company sold
$20 million of Enron commercial paper to Fleet and did not
enter into any direct transactions with Enron. The Company filed
a motion to dismiss the adversary proceeding. The motion to
dismiss was argued at a hearing on September 21, 2004. The
court took the matter under

advisement and the Company is awaiting a
decision. The Company intends to vigorously defend against these
claims. Although the Company believes it has meritorious
defenses to the asserted claims, it is unable at this time to
predict the outcome of this proceeding.

The Company is currently under audit by the
United States Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) for
fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003. The audit has not been
completed and the IRS has not issued a report on its audit.

The Company has received notice that the SEC is
conducting an inquiry into the Company’s granting of stock
options over the last five years to officers and directors. The
Company believes that other companies have received similar
inquiries. Each year, the Company grants stock options to a
broad base of employees (including officers and directors) and
in some years those grants have occurred shortly before
Analog’s issuance of favorable annual financial results.
The SEC has requested information regarding Analog’s stock
option grants and the Company intends to cooperate with the SEC.
The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the inquiry.

From time to time as a normal incidence of the
nature of the Company’s business, various claims, charges
and litigation are asserted or commenced against the Company
arising from, or related to, contractual matters, patents,
trademarks, personal injury, environmental matters, product
liability, insurance coverage and personnel and employment
disputes. As to such claims and litigation, including those
items discussed above, the Company can give no assurance that it
will prevail. However, the Company does not believe that these
matters will have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s consolidated financial position, although an
adverse outcome of any of these matters could have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of
operations or cash flows in the quarter or annual period in
which one or more of these matters are resolved.

Stockholders’ Equity

Stock Plans

On December 5, 2001, the Board of Directors
approved the 2001 Broad-Based Stock Option Plan (2001 Plan),
which provides for the issuance of stock options to purchase up
to 50 million shares of common stock. The 2001 Plan
provides for the issuance of stock options to non-officer
employees, consultants and advisors at a price not less than
100% of the fair market value of the common stock at the time
the option is granted. The Company cannot grant options under
the 2001 Plan to directors or officers.

In fiscal 1998, the stockholders approved the
1998 Stock Option Plan (1998 Plan), which provides for the
issuance of nonstatutory and incentive stock options to purchase
up to 30 million shares of common stock. In March 2000, the
stockholders approved an amendment to the 1998 Plan to increase
the shares reserved for issuance by an additional
34 million shares. Officers, employees, directors,
consultants and advisors of the Company and its subsidiaries are
eligible to be granted options under this plan at a price not
less than 100% (110% in the case of incentive stock options
granted to 10% or greater stockholders) of the fair market value
of the common stock on the date the option is granted. The
Company’s 1988 Stock Option Plan (1988 Plan) was terminated
upon adoption of the 1998 Plan; however, options to purchase
common stock remain outstanding under the 1988 Plan.

While the Company may grant to employees options
that become exercisable at different times or within different
periods, the Company has generally granted to employees options
that are exercisable on a cumulative basis in annual
installments of 33 1/3% on each of the third, fourth and
fifth anniversaries of the date of grant or in annual
installments of 25% on each of the second, third, fourth and
fifth anniversaries of the date of grant.

directors will be granted under the 1998 Plan, under which each
non-employee director is granted annually a non-statutory stock
option to purchase 18,000 shares of common stock at an
exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of
grant. The options granted to directors under the 1998 Plan are
exercisable on a cumulative basis in annual installments of
33 1/3% on each of the first, second and third
anniversaries of the date of grant. The Company’s
1994 Director Option Plan, which was restated in 1998, was
terminated effective March 14, 2000; however, options to
purchase shares of common stock remain outstanding under the
1994 Director Option Plan.

The Company has an employee stock purchase plan
(ESPP) that allows eligible employees to purchase, through
payroll deductions, shares of the Company’s common stock at
85% of the fair market value at specified dates. Employees
purchased a total of 411,355 shares of common stock under
this plan in fiscal 2004 (414,382 shares and
436,885 shares in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002,
respectively) for a total purchase price of $13.1 million
($12.9 million and $13.6 million in fiscal 2003 and
fiscal 2002, respectively). At October 30, 2004, a total of
1,728,245 common shares remained available for issuance under
the ESPP.

Under the 1991 Restricted Stock Plan, which
expired in December 2000, a maximum of 5,400,000 shares of
common stock were authorized for awards by the Company to key
employees for nominal consideration. Shares awarded under the
plan were restricted as to transfer, usually for a period of
five years and, under certain conditions, were subject to
repurchase by the Company at the original purchase price per
share. During fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, $0 million,
$0.4 million and $0.9 million, respectively, of
compensation expense was recorded in connection with grants made
under this plan. As of October 30, 2004, 4,000 common
shares remained subject to forfeiture under the 1991 Restricted
Stock Plan.

As of October 30, 2004, a total of
115,853,685 common shares were reserved for issuance under the
Company’s stock plans.

Common Stock Repurchase

In August 2004, the Company’s Board of
Directors approved the repurchase of up to $500 million of
the Company’s common stock. Under the repurchase program,
the Company may repurchase outstanding shares of its common
stock from time to time in the open market and through privately
negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution
of the Company’s Board of Directors, the repurchase program
will expire when the Company has repurchased all shares
authorized for repurchase under the repurchase program. As of
October 30, 2004, the Company had repurchased
3,863,900 shares of its common stock under this plan for
approximately $137 million at an average purchase price of
$35.48 per share. The Company’s previous repurchase
plan, publicly announced on August 15, 2002, was terminated
by resolution of the Company’s Board of Directors on
August 11, 2004

Effective July 1, 2004, companies
incorporated in Massachusetts became subject to
Chapter 156D of the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act.
Chapter 156D eliminates the concept of treasury shares and
provides that shares reacquired by a company are to be treated
as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. As a result
of this change, the Company has reclassified, for the balance
sheets presented, shares previously classified as treasury
shares as authorized, but unissued shares of common stock. At
November 1, 2003, the Company had 4,040,414 shares at
a cost of $91.4 million that was classified as treasury
stock and has been reclassified to common stock and capital in
excess of par value.

Preferred Stock

The Company has 471,934 authorized shares of
$1.00 par value preferred stock, none of which is issued or
outstanding. The Board of Directors is authorized to fix
designations, relative rights, preferences and limitations on
the preferred stock at the time of issuance. An aggregate of
300,000 shares of preferred stock have been designated as
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock for issuance
in connection with the Company’s Stockholder Rights Plan.

Common Stock Purchase Rights

In March 1998, the Board of Directors adopted a
Stockholder Rights Plan (the Stockholder Rights Plan) that
replaced a plan adopted by the Board in 1988. Pursuant to the
Stockholder Rights Plan, after giving effect to the
Company’s two-for-one stock split effected on
March 15, 2000, each share of the Company’s common
stock currently has an associated one-half of a right. Under
certain circumstances, each whole right would

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

entitle the registered holder to purchase from
the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $180
in cash, subject to adjustment.

The rights are not exercisable and cannot be
transferred separately from the common stock until ten business
days (or such later date as may be determined by the Board of
Directors) after (i) the public announcement that a person
or group of affiliated or associated persons has acquired (or
obtained rights to acquire) beneficial ownership of 15% or more
of common stock or (ii) the commencement of a tender offer
or exchange offer that would result in a person or group
beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding common stock.
If and when the rights become exercisable, each holder of a
right shall have the right to receive, upon exercise, that
number of shares of common stock (or in certain circumstances,
cash, property or other securities of the Company) that equals
the exercise price of the right divided by 50% of the current
market price (as defined in the Stockholder Rights Plan) per
share of common stock at the date of the occurrence of such
event. In the event that at any time after any person becomes an
acquiring person, (i) the Company is consolidated with, or
merged with and into, another entity and the Company is not the
surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or if the
Company is the surviving entity, but shares of its outstanding
common stock are changed or exchanged for stock or securities or
cash or any other property, or (ii) 50% or more of the
Company’s assets or earning power is sold or transferred,
each holder of a right shall thereafter have the right to
receive upon exercise, that number of shares of common stock of
the acquiring company that equals the exercise price of the
right divided by 50% of the current market price of such common
stock at the date of the occurrence of the event.

The rights have certain anti-takeover effects, in
that they would cause substantial dilution to a person or group
that attempts to acquire a significant interest in the Company
on terms not approved by the Board of Directors. The rights
expire on March 17, 2008 but may be redeemed by the Company
for $.001 per right at any time prior to the tenth day
following a person’s acquisition of 15% or more of the
Company’s common stock. So long as the rights are not
separately transferable, each new share of common stock issued
will have one-half of a right associated with it.

Retirement Plans

The Company and its subsidiaries have various
savings and retirement plans covering substantially all
employees. The Company maintains a defined contribution plan for
the benefit of its eligible United States employees. This plan
provides for Company contributions of up to 5% of each
participant’s total eligible compensation. In addition, the
Company contributes an amount equal to each participant’s
pre-tax contribution, if any, up to a maximum of 3% of each
participant’s total eligible compensation. The total
expense related to the defined contribution plan was
$22.1 million in fiscal 2004, $21.6 million in fiscal
2003 and $21.3 million in fiscal 2002. The Company also has
various defined benefit pension and other retirement plans for
certain non-U.S. employees that are consistent with local
statutory requirements and practices. The total expense related
to the various defined benefit pension and other retirement
plans for certain non-U.S. employees was $10.2 million
in fiscal 2004, $8.9 million in fiscal 2003 and
$6.3 million in fiscal 2002.

Non-U.S. Plan Disclosures

The Company’s funding policy for its foreign
defined benefit pension plans is consistent with the local
requirements of each country. The plans’ assets consist
primarily of U.S. and non-U.S. equity securities, bonds,
property and cash. The benefit obligations and related assets
under these plans have been measured at September 30, 2004
and September 30, 2003.

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated
benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for
non-U.S. pension plans with accumulated benefit obligation
in excess of plan assets were $34.2 million,
$28.8 million, and $12.8 million respectively, at
September 30, 2004 and $28.7 million,
$24.2 million and $12.0 million, respectively, at
September 30, 2003.

The range of assumptions used for the
non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflects the different
economic environments within the various countries. The
projected benefit obligation was determined using the following
weighted average assumptions:

The expected long-term rate of return on assets
is a weighted average of the long-term rates of return selected
for the various countries where the Company has funded pension
plans. The expected long-term rate of return on assets
assumption is selected based on the facts and circumstances that
exist as of the measurement date, and the specific portfolio mix
of plan assets. Management, in conjunction with its actuaries,
reviewed anticipated future long-term performance of individual
asset categories and considered the asset allocation strategy
adopted by the Company and or the trustees of the plans. While
the review considered recent fund performance and historical
returns, the assumption is primarily a long-term, prospective
rate.

Expected fiscal 2005 Company contributions and
estimated future benefit payments are as follows:

The Company’s year-end pension plan weighted
average asset allocations by category were:



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The fundamental goal underlying the pension
plans’ investment policy is to achieve a total rate of
return that exceeds inflation over the long-term by using a
certain mix of assets depending on the profile of the specific
plan. Investment practices must comply with applicable laws and
regulations.

The Company’s investment strategy is based
on an expectation that equity securities will outperform debt
securities over the long term. Accordingly, in order to maximize
the return on assets, a majority of assets are invested in
equities. Investments within each asset class are diversified to
reduce the impact of losses in single investments. The use of
derivative instruments is permitted where appropriate and
necessary to achieve overall investment policy objectives and
asset class targets.

The Company establishes strategic asset
allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for
each significant asset class to obtain a prudent balance between
return and risk. The interaction between plan assets and benefit
obligations is periodically studied by the Company and its
actuaries to assist in the establishment of strategic asset
allocation targets.

Income Taxes

The reconciliation of income tax computed at the
U.S. federal statutory rates to income tax expense is as
follows:

For financial reporting purposes, income before
income taxes includes the following components:

The components of the provision for income taxes
are as follows:

The Company continues to intend to reinvest
certain of its foreign earnings indefinitely. Accordingly, no US
income taxes have been provided for approximately
$1,675 million of unremitted earnings of international
subsidiaries. As of October 30, 2004, the amount of
unrecognized deferred tax liability on these earnings was
$351 million.

At October 30, 2004, the Company has
provided a full valuation allowance for its state credit
carryovers of approximately $32.8 million due to the
expiration of the state credit carryovers beginning in 2007.

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 (“AJCA”) was signed into law. The
AJCA creates a temporary incentive for US multinational
corporations to repatriate accumulated income abroad by
providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain
dividends from controlled foreign corporations. The US Treasury
Department is expected to issue regulations with regards to the
AJCA’s repatriation provision. The maximum amount of
dividend distribution of foreign earnings that could potentially
be subject to the provisions of the AJCA would be
$1,055 million, which is the amount reported as
indefinitely reinvested earnings on the Company’s 2002
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The significant components of the Company’s
deferred tax assets and liabilities for the fiscal years ended
October 30, 2004 and November 1, 2003 are as follows:

The Company has provided for potential
liabilities due in various jurisdictions. Judgment is required
in determining the worldwide income tax expense provision. In
the ordinary course of global business, there are many
transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is
uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of
cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities. Although
the Company believes its estimates are reasonable, no assurance
can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will
not be different than that which is reflected in the historical
income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have
a material impact on the Company’s income tax provision and
operating results in the period in which such determination is
made.

The Company is currently under audit by the
United States Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) for
fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003. The audit has not been
completed and the IRS has not issued a report on its audit.

Related Party Transactions

Certain of the Company’s directors are
affiliated with companies that sell products to the Company.
Management believes the terms and prices for the purchases of
these products are no less favorable than those that could be
obtained from unaffiliated parties. One of the Company’s
directors became a director of Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company (TSMC) during fiscal 2002. The
Company purchased approximately $337 million,
$232 million and $206 million of product from TSMC in
fiscal year 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and approximately
$15 million and $14 million was payable to TSMC as of
October 30, 2004 and November 1, 2003, respectively.
Management anticipates that the Company will make significant
purchases from TSMC in fiscal year 2005.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP,
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED

PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Analog Devices, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Analog Devices, Inc. as of October 30,
2004 and November 1, 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders’ equity, comprehensive
income and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended October 30, 2004. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
Item 15(c). These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Analog Devices,
Inc. at October 30, 2004 and November 1, 2003, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended October 30,
2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

financial statements, effective November 3, 2002, the
Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
