ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Company
    Overview

We are a world leader in the design, manufacture and marketing
    of high-performance analog, mixed-signal and digital signal
    processing integrated circuits used in industrial,
    communication, computer and consumer applications. Since our
    inception in 1965, we have focused on solving the engineering
    challenges associated with signal processing in electronic
    equipment. Our signal processing products translate real-world
    phenomena such as light, sound, temperature, motion and pressure
    into electrical signals to be used in a wide array of electronic
    equipment. Used by over 60,000 customers worldwide, our products
    are embedded inside many types of electronic equipment including
    industrial process controls, factory automation systems, defense
    electronics, portable wireless communications devices, cellular
    basestations, central office networking equipment, computers,
    automobiles, medical imaging equipment, digital cameras and
    digital televisions. Signal processing technology is a critical
    element of high-speed communications, digital entertainment, and
    other consumer, computer and industrial applications. As new
    generations of digital applications evolve, they generate new
    needs for high-performance analog signal processing and digital
    signal processing, or DSP, technology. We produce a wide range
    of products that are designed to meet the signal processing
    technology needs of a broad base of customers.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we completed the sale
    of our baseband chipset business and related support operations,
    or Baseband Chipset Business, to MediaTek Inc. and the sale of
    our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to
    certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation.
    Accordingly, these operations have been presented as
    discontinued operations within the consolidated financial
    statements in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or
    Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (SFAS 144)

    as products used for high-speed access to the Internet,
    including central office networking equipment.

Revenue from our products used in high-performance consumer
    electronics represented approximately 21% of our product revenue
    for fiscal 2008. Applications in this market include digital
    cameras and camcorders, flat-panel digital televisions, video
    game applications and surround sound audio systems.

We also serve the personal computer and network server markets
    with products that enable high-quality audio and products that
    monitor and manage power usage. In fiscal 2008, the computer
    market represented approximately 5% of our product revenue.

We sell our products worldwide through a direct sales force,
    third-party distributors and independent sales representatives
    and through our website. We have direct sales offices in 17
    countries, including the United States.

We are headquartered near Boston, in Norwood, Massachusetts, and
    have manufacturing facilities in Massachusetts, Ireland and the
    Philippines. We were founded in 1965 and are incorporated in
    Massachusetts. As of November 1, 2008, we employed
    approximately 9,000 individuals worldwide. Our common stock is

Industry
    Background

All electronic signals fall into one of two categories, analog
    or digital. Analog, also known as linear, signals represent
    real-world phenomena, such as temperature, pressure, sound,
    speed and motion. This information can be detected and measured
    using analog sensors by generating continuously-varying voltages
    and currents. The signals from these sensors are initially
    processed using analog methods, such as amplification, filtering
    and shaping. They are then usually converted to digital form for
    storage or further manipulation. The further manipulation of the
    signals after conversion to digital form is called “digital
    signal processing.” Digital signals represent the
    “ones” and “zeros” of binary arithmetic and
    are either on or off. Digital signals are frequently converted
    back to analog form for functions such as video display, audio
    output or control. We refer to these manipulations and
    transformations as “real-world signal processing.”

Significant developments in semiconductor technology in recent
    years have substantially increased the performance and
    functionality of integrated circuits, or ICs, used in signal
    processing applications. These developments include: the ability
    to combine analog and digital signal processing capability on a
    single chip, thereby making possible more highly-integrated
    solutions; and the widespread application of low-cost,
    high-performance microprocessor-based systems, which motivate
    customers to convert analog information into digital information
    that can be managed by these microprocessors. At the same time,
    the ongoing transition to digital media for communications,
    music, photography, and video has increased the need for
    precise, high-speed signal conditioning interfaces between the
    analog world and digital electronics. The convergence of
    computing, communications, and consumer electronics has resulted
    in end products that incorporate

state-of-the-art

signal processing capability onto fewer chips and with less
    power consumption. Our products are designed to be used within
    electronic equipment to achieve higher performance, including
    greater speed, improved accuracy, more efficient signal
    processing and minimized power consumption.

Principal
    Products

We design, manufacture and market a broad line of
    high-performance ICs that incorporate analog, mixed-signal and
    digital signal processing technologies. Our ICs are designed to
    address a wide range of real-world signal processing
    applications. Across the entire range of our product portfolio
    are both general-purpose products used by a broad range of
    customers and applications as well as application-specific
    products designed for specific clusters of customers in key
    target markets. By using readily available, high-performance,
    general-purpose products in their systems, our customers can
    reduce the time they need to bring new products to market. Given
    the high cost of developing more customized ICs, our standard
    products often provide the most cost-effective solution for many
    low to medium volume applications. However, in some
    communications, computer and consumer products, we focus on
    working with leading customers to design application-specific
    solutions. We begin with our existing core technologies in data
    conversion, amplification, power management, radio frequency and
    DSP, and devise a solution to more closely meet the needs of a
    specific customer or group of customers. Because we have already
    developed the core technology for our general-purpose products,
    we can create application-specific solutions quickly.

We produce and market several thousand products and operate in
    one reporting segment. Our ten highest revenue products, in the
    aggregate, accounted for approximately 10% of our revenue for
    fiscal 2008. The majority of our products are proprietary,
    meaning equivalent products are not available from competitors.
    A limited number of other companies may provide products with
    similar functions.



Analog
    Products

Our analog IC technology has been the foundation of our business
    for over four decades, and we believe we are one of the
    world’s largest suppliers of high-performance analog ICs.
    Our analog signal processing ICs are primarily high-performance
    devices, generally defined as devices that support a minimum of
    10-bits of accuracy and a minimum of 50 megahertz of speed. The
    principal advantages these products have versus
    competitors’ products include higher accuracy, lower cost
    per function, smaller size, lower power consumption and fewer
    components resulting in improved reliability. The majority of
    our analog IC products are proprietary to us in their design and
    our product portfolio addresses a wide range of applications.
    Our product portfolio includes several thousand analog ICs, any
    one of which can have as many as several hundred customers. Our
    analog ICs typically have long product life cycles. Our analog
    IC customers include both original equipment manufacturers, or
    OEMs, and customers who build electronic subsystems for
    integration into larger systems.

We derive the majority of our analog signal processing IC
    product revenue from sales of data converters and amplifiers. We
    are the industry’s leading supplier of data converter
    products. Data converters translate real-world analog signals
    into digital data and also translate digital data into analog
    signals. Amplifiers are used to condition analog signals and
    minimize noise. The data converter and amplifier product
    categories represented approximately 69% of our fiscal 2008
    revenue, with converters representing 46% and amplifiers
    representing 23%.

Over the past several years we have been expanding our analog IC
    product offerings along the entire signal chain and into areas
    such as micro-electromechanical systems, or MEMS, radio
    frequency integrated circuits, or RF ICs, and power management.

Our analog technology base also includes products using an
    advanced IC technology known in the industry as surface
    micromachining, which is used to produce semiconductor products
    known as micro-electromechanical systems, or MEMS. This
    technology enables us to build extremely small mechanical
    sensing elements on the surface of a chip along with supporting
    circuitry. In addition to incorporating an electro-mechanical
    structure, these devices also have analog circuitry for
    conditioning signals obtained from the sensing element. The
    integration of signal conditioning and MEMS is a unique feature
    of our products which we call
    iMEMS

®

.

    Our iMEMS product portfolio includes accelerometers used to
    sense acceleration, and gyroscopes used to sense position. The
    majority of our current revenue from MEMS products is derived
    from accelerometers used by automotive manufacturers in airbag
    applications and in video game applications. However,
    opportunities from consumer and industrial customers are
    increasing as we develop products using this technology for
    applications in these end markets.

Our MEMS and RF products as well as other analog signal
    processing products such as high-speed clock ICs, are included
    in our “Other Analog” product category, which
    collectively represented 15% of our total revenue in fiscal 2008.

Power management and reference products contributed 6% of our
    total revenue in fiscal 2008. Whether the product is plugged
    into the wall or runs on batteries, every electronic device
    requires some form of power management, which can include
    converters, battery chargers, charge pumps, and regulators. We
    leverage our leading analog signal technology to devise
    innovative high-performance power management ICs,
    high-reliability infrastructure equipment and battery-operated
    portable medical, communications and consumer devices.

Digital
    Signal Processing Products

Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) are optimized for high-speed
    numeric calculations, which are essential for instantaneous, or
    real-time, processing of digital data generated, in most cases,
    from analog to digital signal conversion. DSP product revenue
    represented 10% of our fiscal 2008 revenue. Our DSP products are
    designed to be fully programmable and to efficiently execute
    specialized software programs, or algorithms, associated with
    processing digitized real-time, real-world data. Programmable
    DSPs provide the flexibility to modify the device’s
    function quickly and inexpensively using software. Our
    general-purpose DSP IC customers typically write their own
    algorithms using software development tools that we provide and
    software development tools they obtain from third-party
    suppliers. Our DSPs are designed in families of products that
    share a common architecture and therefore can execute the same
    software. We support these products with easy-to-use, low-cost
    development tools, which are designed to reduce our
    customers’ product development costs and

time-to-market.



Markets
    and Applications

The following describes some of the characteristics of, and
    customer products within, our major markets:

Industrial

— Our industrial market
    includes the following areas:

Industrial Process Automation

— Our industrial
    process automation market includes applications, such as factory
    automation systems, automatic process control systems, robotics,
    environmental control systems and automatic test equipment.
    These applications generally require ICs that offer performance
    greater than that available from commodity-level ICs but
    generally do not have production volumes that warrant custom or
    application-specific ICs. Combinations of analog, mixed-signal
    and DSP ICs are usually employed to achieve the necessary
    functionality.

Instrumentation

— Our instrumentation market
    includes engineering, medical and scientific instruments. These
    applications are usually designed using the highest performance
    analog and mixed-signal ICs available. Customer products include
    oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, CT scanners, MRI equipment,
    blood analyzers and microscopes.

Defense/Aerospace

— The defense, commercial
    avionics and space markets all require high-performance ICs that
    meet rigorous environmental and reliability specifications. Many
    of our analog ICs can be supplied in versions that meet these
    standards. In addition, many products can be supplied to meet
    the standards required for broadcast satellites and other
    commercial space applications. Most of our products sold in this
    market are specifically tested versions of products derived from
    our standard product offering. Customer products include
    navigation systems, flight simulators, radar systems and
    security devices.

Automotive

— Although the automotive market has
    historically been served with low-cost, low-performance ICs,
    demand has emerged for higher performance devices for a wide
    range of safety and entertainment applications, as well as for
    powertrain electronics. In response, we have developed products
    specifically for the automotive market. We supply a MEMS IC used
    as a crash sensor in airbag systems, roll-over sensing, global
    positioning satellite, or GPS, automotive navigation systems,
    anti-lock brakes and “smart” suspension systems. We
    offer a wide portfolio of analog ICs used in powertrain and body
    electronics applications to help improve fuel efficiency and
    lower emissions. In addition, our analog and DSP ICs have
    application in engine control, in-cabin electronics, audio and
    collision avoidance systems.

Communications

— The development of
    broadband, wireless and Internet infrastructures around the
    world has created an important market for our communications
    products. Communications technology involves the acquisition of
    analog signals that are converted from analog to digital and
    digital to analog form during the process of transmitting and
    receiving data. The need for higher speed and reduced power
    consumption, coupled with more reliable, bandwidth-efficient
    communications, has been creating demand for our products. Our
    products are used in the full spectrum of signal processing for
    audio, data, image and video communication. In wireless and
    broadband communication applications, our products are
    incorporated into cellular handsets, cellular basestation
    equipment, portable media devices, PBX switches, routers and
    remote access servers.

Consumer

— Market demand for digital
    entertainment systems and the consumer demand for high quality
    voice, music, movies and photographs have allowed us to combine
    analog and digital design capability to provide solutions that
    meet the rigorous cost requirements of the consumer electronics
    market. The emergence of high-performance, feature-rich consumer
    products, such as digital camcorders and cameras, home theater
    systems, LCD digital televisions, video projectors, video game
    applications and high-definition DVD recorders/players, has
    created a market for our high-performance ICs with a high level
    of specific functionality.

Computer

— We currently supply ICs used
    for high fidelity audio in desktop and notebook computers and
    for power management in server computers. Our products are also
    used in computer peripherals such as displays, printers and
    scanners.

Research
    and Development

Our markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and
    advances. Accordingly, we make substantial investments in the
    design and development of new products and manufacturing
    processes, and the improvement of



existing products and manufacturing processes. We spent
    approximately $533 million during fiscal 2008 on the
    design, development and improvement of new and existing products
    and manufacturing processes, compared to approximately
    $510 million during fiscal 2007 and approximately
    $460 million during fiscal 2006.

Our research and development strategy focuses on building
    technical leadership in core technologies for signal sensing,
    conditioning, conversion and processing. In addition, we have
    been increasing our investment in analog products used for power
    management. In support of our research and development
    activities, we employ thousands of engineers involved in product
    and manufacturing process development at 40 design centers and
    manufacturing sites located throughout the world.

Patents
    and Other Intellectual Property Rights

We seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our
    technology and products through the use of patents, copyrights,
    trademarks and trade secret laws. We have a program to file
    applications for and obtain patents, copyrights and trademarks
    in the United States and in selected foreign countries where we
    believe filing for such protection is appropriate. We also seek
    to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by
    nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate
    confidentiality agreements. We have obtained a substantial
    number of patents and trademarks in the United States and in
    other countries. As of November 1, 2008, we held
    approximately 1,400 U.S. patents and approximately 550
    non-provisional pending U.S. patent applications. There can
    be no assurance, however, that the rights obtained can be
    successfully enforced against infringing products in every
    jurisdiction. While our patents, copyrights, trademarks and
    trade secrets provide some advantage and protection, we believe
    our competitive position and future success is largely
    determined by such factors as the system and application
    knowledge, innovative skills, technological expertise and
    management ability and experience of our personnel; the range
    and success of new products being developed by us; our market
    brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts; customer
    service and technical support. It is generally our policy to
    seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be
    patented, though we may elect, in certain cases, not to seek
    patent protection even for significant inventions, if we
    determine other protection, such as maintaining the invention as
    a trade secret, to be more advantageous. We also have trademarks
    that are used in the conduct of our business to distinguish
    genuine Analog Devices products and we maintain cooperative
    advertising programs to promote our brands and identify products
    containing genuine Analog Devices components. In addition, we
    have registered certain of our mask sets, which are akin to the
    blueprint for building an IC, under the Semiconductor Chip
    Protection Act of 1984.

Sales
    Channels

We sell our products in North America and internationally
    through a direct sales force, third-party distributors,
    independent sales representatives and via our worldwide website
    on the Internet.

We derived approximately 53% of our fiscal 2008 product revenue
    from sales made through distributors. These distributors
    typically maintain an inventory of our products. Some of them
    also sell products competitive with our products, including
    those for which we are an alternate source. In all regions of
    the world, we defer revenue and the related cost of sales on
    shipments to distributors until the distributors resell the
    products to their customers. We make sales to distributors under
    agreements that allow distributors to receive price adjustment
    credits and to return qualifying products for credit, as
    determined by us, in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving,
    discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. These
    agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of our
    shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter. In
    addition, distributors are allowed to return unsold products if
    we terminate the relationship with the distributor. Additional
    information relating to our sales to distributors is set forth
    in Note 2n. in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

The categorization of sales into geographic regions is based
    upon the location of the customer.

We derived approximately 20% of our fiscal 2008 revenue from
    customers in the United States and approximately 4% from
    customers elsewhere in North and South America. As of
    November 1, 2008, we had 12 direct sales offices in the
    United States.



We derived approximately 26% of our fiscal 2008 revenue from
    customers in Europe. As of November 1, 2008, we had direct
    sales offices in Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Israel,
    Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

We derived approximately 19% of our fiscal 2008 revenue from
    customers in Japan.

We derived approximately 16% of our fiscal 2008 revenue from
    customers in China and approximately 15% from customers
    elsewhere in Asia, principally Taiwan and Korea. As of
    November 1, 2008, we had direct sales offices in the Asia
    region in China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Singapore, and
    Taiwan.

We also have sales representatives

and/or

distributors in over 40 countries outside North America,
    including countries where we also have direct sales offices. For
    further detail regarding revenue and financial information about
    our industry, segment and geographic areas, see our Consolidated
    Financial Statements and Note 4 in the related Notes
    contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

We support our worldwide technical direct field sales efforts by
    an extensive promotional program that includes editorial
    coverage and paid advertising in trade publications, direct mail
    programs, promotional brochures, technical seminars and
    participation in trade shows. We publish and distribute product
    catalogs, applications guides, technical handbooks and detailed
    data sheets for individual products. We also provide this
    information and sell products via our worldwide website on the
    Internet. We maintain a staff of field application engineers who
    aid customers in incorporating our products into their products.

We have tens of thousands of customers worldwide. Our largest
    single customer, excluding distributors, represented
    approximately 4% of our fiscal 2008 revenue. Our 20 largest
    customers, excluding distributors, accounted for approximately
    32% of our fiscal 2008 revenue. These customers used hundreds of
    different types of our products in a wide range of applications
    spanning the industrial, computer, communication and consumer
    markets.

Seasonality

Sales to customers during our first fiscal quarter may be lower
    than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our
    customers during the holiday season. In general, the seasonality
    for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on
    our results of operations. In addition, as explained in our risk
    factors included elsewhere in this report, our revenue is more
    likely to be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by
    cyclicality in the semiconductor industry.

Foreign
    Operations

Through subsidiaries and affiliates, we conduct business in
    numerous countries outside the United States. During fiscal
    2008, we derived approximately 80% of our revenue from customers
    in international markets. Our international business is subject
    to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations,
    including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and
    controls, import and export controls, and other laws, policies
    and regulations of foreign governments. Although we engage in
    hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange
    rate fluctuations, our competitive position may be adversely
    affected by changes in the exchange rate of the United States
    dollar against other currencies.

Production
    and Raw Materials

Monolithic integrated circuit components are manufactured in a
    sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer
    fabrication, wafer testing, cutting the wafer into individual
    “chips,” or dice, assembly of the dice into packages
    and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form.
    The raw materials used to manufacture these devices include
    silicon wafers, processing chemicals (including liquefied
    gases), precious metals and ceramic and plastic used for
    packaging.

We develop and employ a wide variety of proprietary
    manufacturing processes that are specifically tailored for use
    in fabricating high-performance analog, DSP, mixed-signal and
    MEMS ICs. We also use bipolar and complementary metal-oxide
    semiconductor, or CMOS, wafer fabrication processes.



Our IC products are fabricated both at our production facilities
    and by third-party wafer fabricators. Most of our analog
    products are manufactured in our own wafer fabrication
    facilities using proprietary processes. Our DSP products, and a
    portion of our analog products, are manufactured at third-party
    wafer-fabrication foundries using

sub-micron

digital CMOS processes. Approximately 44%, 43% and 41% of our
    revenue in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, was from
    products fabricated at third-party wafer-fabrication facilities,
    primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). We
    operate wafer fabrication facilities in Wilmington and
    Cambridge, Massachusetts and Limerick, Ireland. We also operate
    test facilities located in the Philippines and use third-party
    subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products.

Capital spending was $157.4 million in fiscal 2008,
    compared with $141.8 million in fiscal 2007. We currently
    plan to make capital expenditures of approximately
    $55 million in fiscal 2009.

Our products require a wide variety of components, raw materials
    and external foundry services, most of which we purchase from
    third-party suppliers. We have multiple sources for many of the
    components and materials that we purchase and incorporate into
    our products. However, a large portion of our external wafer
    purchases and foundry services are from a limited number of
    suppliers, primarily TSMC. If TSMC or any of our other key
    suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver
    sufficient quantities of components to us, on the time schedule
    and of the quality that we require, we may be forced to seek to
    engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result
    in significant expenses and disruptions or delays in
    manufacturing, product development and shipment of product to
    our customers. Although we have experienced shortages of
    components, materials and external foundry services from time to
    time, these items have generally been available to us as needed.

Backlog

Backlog at the end of fiscal 2008 was approximately
    $333 million, down from approximately $396 million at
    the end of fiscal 2007. We define backlog as of a particular
    date to mean firm orders with a customer or distributor with a
    requested delivery date within thirteen weeks. Backlog is
    impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead
    times available from suppliers, including us, in periods of
    depressed demand. In periods of increased demand, there is a
    tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of
    increasing backlog and, in some instances, we may not have
    manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders. As is
    customary in the semiconductor industry, we allow most orders to
    be cancelled or deliveries to be delayed by customers without
    significant penalty. Accordingly, we believe that our backlog at
    any time should not be used as an indication of our future
    revenue.

We typically do not have long-term sales contracts with our
    customers. In some of our markets where end-user demand may be
    particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers
    place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it
    available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to
    make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the
    product. In other instances, we manufacture product based on
    forecasts of customer demands. As a result, we may incur
    inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated
    sales and are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders
    leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. Further,
    those orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the
    customer’s unique requirements so that those cancelled
    orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable
    products, resulting in potential inventory write-offs. As a
    result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for some of our products
    that are subject to these uncertainties, the amount of
    unsaleable product could be substantial.

Government
    Contracts

We estimate that approximately 3% of our fiscal 2008 product
    revenue was attributable to sales to the U.S. government
    and U.S. government contractors and subcontractors. Our
    government contract business is predominantly in the form of
    negotiated, firm fixed-price subcontracts. All such contracts
    and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to
    termination at the election of the U.S. government.

Acquisitions,
    Divestitures and Investments

An element of our business strategy involves expansion through
    the acquisition of businesses, assets, products or technologies
    that allow us to complement our existing product offerings,
    expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce
    or enhance our technological capabilities. From time to time, we
    consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen our
    business.



Additional information relating to our acquisition and
    divestiture activities during fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and
    fiscal 2006 is set forth in Note 2u., Note 6 and
    Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Competition

We compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets
    that are highly competitive. Our competitors include Broadcom
    Corporation, Cirrus Logic, Inc., Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.,
    Infineon Technologies, Intersil Corporation, Linear Technology
    Corporation, Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., Microchip
    Technology Inc., National Semiconductor Corporation, NXP
    Semiconductors, ST Microelectronics, Silicon Laboratories, Inc.
    and Texas Instruments, Inc.

We believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for
    real-world signal processing components depends upon several
    factors, including design and quality of products, product
    performance, features and functionality, and product pricing,
    availability and capacity, with the relative importance of these
    factors varying among products, markets and customers. We
    believe our technical innovation emphasizing product performance
    and reliability, supported by our commitment to strong customer
    service and technical support, enables us to compete in our
    chosen markets against both foreign and domestic semiconductor
    manufacturers.

Many other companies offer products that compete with our
    products, and some have greater financial, manufacturing,
    technical and marketing resources than we have. Some of our
    competitors may have better established supply or development
    relationships with our current and potential customers.
    Additionally, some formerly independent competitors have been
    purchased by larger companies. Our competitors also include
    emerging companies selling specialized products into markets we
    serve. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete
    successfully in the future against existing or new competitors,
    or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by
    increased price competition.

Environment

We are committed to protecting the environment and the health
    and safety of our employees, customers and the public. We
    endeavor to adhere to the most stringent standards across all of
    our facilities, to encourage pollution prevention, to reduce our
    energy consumption and to strive towards continual improvement.
    We strive to achieve a standard of excellence in environmental,
    health and safety management practices as an integral part of
    our total quality management system.

In fiscal 2008, we became an applicant member of the Electronic
    Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC).

Our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous and
    increasingly strict environmental laws and regulations,
    particularly with respect to the transportation, storage,
    handling, use, emission, discharge and disposal of certain
    chemicals, gases and other substances used or produced in the
    semiconductor manufacturing process. Contracts with many of our
    customers reflect these and additional environmental compliance
    obligations. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not
    had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings,
    financial condition or competitive position. There can be no
    assurance, however, that current or future environmental laws
    and regulations will not impose costly requirements upon us. Any
    failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws,
    regulations and contractual obligations could result in fines,
    suspension of production, alteration of fabrication processes
    and legal liability.

Employees

As of November 1, 2008, we employed approximately 9,000
    individuals worldwide. Our future success depends in large part
    on the continued service of our key technical and senior
    management personnel, and on our ability to continue to attract,
    retain and motivate qualified employees, particularly those
    highly-skilled design, process, test and applications engineers
    involved in the design, support and manufacture of new and
    existing products and processes. We believe that relations with
    our employees are good; however, the competition for such
    personnel is intense, and the loss of key personnel could have a
    material adverse impact on our results of operations and
    financial condition.



ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other
    documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and
    uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ
    materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking
    statements contained in this report.

Our
    future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income
    are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate.

Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net
    income are difficult to predict and may be materially affected
    by a number of factors, including:

•

the effects of adverse economic conditions in the United States
    and international markets, including the current crisis in
    global credit and financial markets;

•

changes in customer demand for our products and for end products
    that incorporate our products;

•

the effectiveness of our efforts to refocus our operations and
    reduce our cost structure;

•

the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us,
    our customers or our competitors;

•

competitive pricing pressures;

•

fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of
    wafers and other raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and
    test capacity;

•

any significant decline in our backlog;

•

the timing, delay or cancellation of significant customer orders
    and our ability to manage inventory;

•

our ability to hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of
    engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of
    our customers;

•

changes in geographic, product or customer mix;

•

our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient
    levels;

•

potential significant litigation-related costs;

•

the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating
    expense levels, including with respect to costs associated with
    labor, utilities, transportation and raw materials;

•

the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide
    environmental regulations;

•

changes in our effective tax rates in the United States, Ireland
    or worldwide; and

•

the effects of public health emergencies, natural disasters,
    security risks, terrorist activities, international conflicts
    and other events beyond our control.

In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been
    cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and
    downturns. Our business is subject to rapid technological
    changes and there can be no assurance, depending on the mix of
    future business, that products stocked in our inventory will not
    be rendered obsolete before we ship them. As a result of these
    and other factors, there can be no assurance that we will not
    experience material fluctuations in future revenue, gross
    margins, operating results and net income on a quarterly or
    annual basis. In addition, if our revenue, gross margins,
    operating results and net income do not meet the expectations of
    securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common
    stock may decline.

Long-term
    contracts are not typical for us and reductions, cancellations
    or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our
    operating results.

We typically do not have long-term sales contracts with our
    customers. In certain markets where end-user demand may be
    particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers
    place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it
    available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to
    make a binding



commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. In
    other instances, we manufacture product based on forecasts of
    customer demands. As a result, we may incur inventory and
    manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are
    subject to the risk of cancellations of orders, leading to a
    sharp reduction of sales and backlog. Further, orders or
    forecasts may be for products that meet the customer’s
    unique requirements so that those cancelled or unrealized orders
    would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable
    products, resulting in potential inventory write-offs. As a
    result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the
    products that are subject to these uncertainties, the amount of
    unsaleable product could be substantial. Incorrect forecasts, or
    reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products
    could adversely affect our operating results.

The
    current crisis in global credit and financial markets could
    materially and adversely affect our business and results of
    operations.

As widely reported, global credit and financial markets have
    been experiencing extreme disruptions in recent months,
    including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability,
    declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth,
    increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about economic
    stability. There can be no assurance that there will not be
    further deterioration in credit and financial markets and
    confidence in economic conditions. These economic uncertainties
    affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it
    difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business
    activities. The current tightening of credit in financial
    markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending,
    which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their
    existing and future orders with us. In addition, financial
    difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could
    result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults
    and inventory challenges. The volatility in the credit markets
    has severely diminished liquidity and capital availability. We
    are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the
    current disruptions in the credit and financial markets and
    adverse global economic conditions, and if the current uncertain
    economic conditions continue or further deteriorate, our
    business and results of operations could be materially and
    adversely affected.

Our
    future success depends upon our ability to continue to innovate,
    improve our products, develop and market new products, and
    identify and enter new markets.

Our success significantly depends on our continued ability to
    improve our products and develop and market innovative new
    products. Product development, innovation and enhancement is
    often a complex, time-consuming and costly process involving
    significant investment in research and development, with no
    assurance of return on investment. There can be no assurance
    that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved
    products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and
    improved products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance.
    Our products generally must conform to various evolving and
    sometimes competing industry standards, which may adversely
    affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us
    to incur significant costs. In addition, our customers generally
    impose very high quality and reliability standards on our
    products, which often change and may be difficult or costly to
    satisfy. Any inability to satisfy such customer quality
    standards or comply with industry standards and technical
    requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and
    our results of operations. In addition, our growth is dependent
    on our continued ability to identify and penetrate new markets
    where we have limited experience and competition is intense.
    Also, some of our customers in these markets are less
    established, which could subject us to increased credit risk.
    There can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in
    the future, that our existing and new products will meet the
    requirements of these markets, that our products will achieve
    customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not
    force price reductions or take market share from us, or that we
    can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in
    these markets. Furthermore, a decline in demand in one or
    several of our end-user markets could have a material adverse
    effect on the demand for our products and our results of
    operations.

We may
    not be able to compete successfully in markets within the
    semiconductor industry in the future.

We face intense technological and pricing competition in the
    semiconductor industry, and we expect such competition to
    increase in the future. Many other companies offer products that
    compete with our products. Some have greater financial,
    manufacturing, technical and marketing resources than we have.
    Some of our competitors may have better established supply or
    development relationships with our current and potential
    customers or



suppliers. Our competitors also include emerging companies
    selling specialized products in markets we serve. Competition is
    generally based on design and quality of products, product
    performance, features and functionality, and product pricing,
    availability and capacity, with the relative importance of these
    factors varying among products, markets and customers. Existing
    or new competitors may develop products or technologies that
    more effectively address the demands of our customers and
    markets with enhanced performance, features and functionality,
    lower power requirements, greater levels of integration or lower
    cost. Increased competition in certain markets has resulted in
    and may continue to result in declining average selling prices,
    reduced gross margins and loss of market share in such markets.
    There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete
    successfully in the future against existing or new competitors,
    or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by
    increased competition.

We rely
    on third-party subcontractors and manufacturers for some
    industry-standard wafers and assembly and test services, and
    generally cannot control their availability or conditions of
    supply.

We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on assembly and test
    subcontractors and on third-party wafer fabricators to supply
    most of our wafers that can be manufactured using
    industry-standard submicron processes. This reliance involves
    several risks, including reduced control over availability,
    capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields,
    quality assurance and costs. Additionally, we utilize a limited
    number of third-party wafer fabricators, primarily Taiwan
    Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. These suppliers manufacture
    components in accordance with our proprietary designs and
    specifications. In addition, these suppliers often provide
    manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods
    of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints.
    If these suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and
    deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time
    schedule and of the quality that we require, we may be forced to
    seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could
    result in additional expenses and delays in product development
    or shipment of product to our customers. Approximately 44% of
    our fiscal 2008 revenue was from products fabricated at
    third-party wafer-fabrication facilities, primarily TSMC.

The
    markets for semiconductor products are cyclical, and we may not
    be able to satisfy sufficiently the demand for our products,
    while increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower
    prices.

The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted
    in periods when demand for our products has increased or
    decreased rapidly. During periods of rapid increases in demand,
    our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the
    demand. In addition, we may not be able to expand our workforce
    and operations in a sufficiently timely manner, procure adequate
    resources, or locate suitable third-party suppliers, to respond
    effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to
    the demand for new products requested by our customers, and our
    current or future business could be materially and adversely
    affected. Conversely, if we expand our operations and workforce
    too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of
    increased demand for our products, and such demand does not
    materialize at the pace at which we expect, or declines, our
    operating results may be adversely affected as a result of
    increased operating expenses, reduced margins, underutilization
    of capacity or asset impairment charges. These capacity
    expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could
    also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead
    to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating
    results.

Our
    semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to
    product warranty and indemnity claims, which could result in
    significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely
    affect the market acceptance of our products.

Semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain
    defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are
    developed. We generally warrant our products to our customers
    for one year from the date title passes from us. We invest
    significant resources in the testing of our products; however,
    if any of our products contain defects, we may be required to
    incur additional development and remediation costs, pursuant to
    warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer
    contracts and purchase orders. These problems may divert our
    technical and other resources from other product development
    efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers
    or others, including liability for costs associated with product
    recalls, which may adversely impact our operating results. We
    may also be subject to customer indemnity claims. Our customers
    have on occasion been sued, and may



in the future be sued by third parties with respect to
    infringement or other product matters, and those customers may
    seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of
    our sales contracts with them. In certain cases, our potential
    indemnification liability may be significant. There can be no
    assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all
    claims and potential liabilities. If any of our products
    contains defects, or has reliability, quality or compatibility
    problems, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it
    more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and
    prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating
    results.

We have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial
    amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits
    is a highly complex and precise process. Minute impurities,
    contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in
    the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer
    manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer
    breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of
    wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be
    nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in
    semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes
    could become unstable. This instability could result in
    manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a
    material adverse effect on our operating results.

We may be
    unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which may
    limit our ability to compete effectively.

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our
    intellectual property. We primarily rely on patent, mask work,
    copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as
    nondisclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our
    proprietary technologies and processes. Despite our efforts to
    protect our proprietary technologies and processes, it is
    possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties
    may obtain, copy, use or disclose our technologies and
    processes. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we
    design, manufacture, market and sell our products may afford
    little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology.

There can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued
    patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In
    addition, any of our existing or future patents may be
    challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As such, any rights
    granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful
    protection. We may not have foreign patents or pending
    applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and
    applications. Even if foreign patents are granted, effective
    enforcement in foreign countries may not be available. If our
    patents do not adequately protect our technology, our
    competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours. Our
    competitors may also be able to develop similar technology
    independently or design around our patents. Other companies or
    individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of
    semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to
    obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from
    making and selling the infringing products, if such patents are
    found to be valid. There can be no assurance that we would be
    able to obtain licenses, if required, upon commercially
    reasonable terms, or at all.

We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our
    employees, consultants and strategic partners. We also try to
    control access to and distribution of our technologies,
    documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these
    efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy,
    disclose, obtain or use our products or technology without our
    authorization. Also, former employees may seek employment with
    our business partners, customers or competitors, and there can
    be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary
    information will be maintained in the course of such future
    employment.

We are
    involved in frequent litigation, including regarding
    intellectual property rights, which could be costly to bring or
    defend and could require us to redesign products or pay
    significant royalties.

The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims
    and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property
    rights, including claims arising under our contractual
    obligations to indemnify our customers. From time to time, we
    receive claims from third parties asserting that our products or
    processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property
    rights. In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual
    property claim against us and a license is not available to us
    on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced
    either to redesign or to stop production of products
    incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating
    results could be materially and adversely affected. Litigation
    may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our
    intellectual



property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement,
    and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of
    our key personnel. We could be subject to warranty or product
    liability claims that could lead to significant costs and
    expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards. There
    can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect
    against all claims and potential liabilities. We may incur costs
    and expenses relating to a recall of our customers’
    products due to an alleged failure of components we supply. See
    Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for information concerning certain litigation that involves us.
    An adverse outcome in litigation could have a material adverse
    effect on our financial position or on our operating results or
    cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved.

If we do
    not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our
    business strategy will be adversely affected.

Our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the
    recruitment, retention and effective succession of our executive
    officers and key management and technical personnel,
    particularly our experienced engineers. The competition for
    these employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or
    more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect
    on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material
    adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for
    engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if
    we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do
    not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our
    officers or employees.

To remain
    competitive, we may need to acquire other companies, purchase or
    license technology from third parties, or enter into other
    strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or
    enhance our existing products.

An element of our business strategy involves expansion through
    the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies
    that allow us to complement our existing product offerings,
    expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce
    or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to
    find businesses that have the technology or resources we need
    and, if we find such businesses, we may not be able to purchase
    or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable
    terms or at all. Acquisitions and technology licenses are
    difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons,
    including the cost of potential transactions, competition among
    prospective buyers and licensees, the need for regulatory
    approvals, and difficulties related to integration efforts. In
    order to finance a potential transaction, we may need to raise
    additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money. We
    may not be able to find financing on favorable terms, and the
    sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing
    shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are
    superior to the rights of our common shareholders. Our current
    credit facility imposes restrictions on our ability to undertake
    certain transactions, to create certain liens on our assets and
    to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness, and requires us to
    maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. If we
    breach any of the covenants under our credit facility and do not
    obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable
    cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be
    declared immediately due and payable.

Acquisitions also involve a number of risks, including:

•

difficulty integrating acquired technologies, operations and
    personnel with our existing businesses;

•

diversion of management attention in connection with both
    negotiating the acquisitions and integrating the assets;

•

strain on managerial and operational resources as management
    tries to oversee larger operations;

•

the future funding requirements for acquired companies, which
    may be significant;

•

potential loss of key employees;

•

exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired
    companies; and

•

increased risk of costly and time-consuming litigation.



If we are unable to successfully address these risks, we may not
    realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition,
    which may have an adverse effect on our business plans and
    operating results.

We rely
    on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable
    areas, which could affect the availability of supplies and
    services.

We, like many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on
    internal manufacturing capacity, wafer fabrication foundries and
    other

sub-contractors

in geologically unstable locations around the world. This
    reliance involves risks associated with the impact of
    earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry, including
    temporary loss of capacity, availability and cost of key raw
    materials, utilities and equipment and availability of key
    services, including transport of our products worldwide. Any
    prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing
    facilities, or those of our subcontractors or third-party wafer
    fabrication foundries, as a result of fire, natural disaster,
    unavailability of utilities or otherwise, would have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
    condition.

We are
    exposed to business, economic, political, legal and other risks
    through our significant worldwide operations.

We have significant operations and manufacturing facilities
    outside the United States, including in Ireland and the
    Philippines. During fiscal 2008, approximately 80% of our
    product revenue was derived from customers in international
    markets. Although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce
    our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can
    be no assurance that our competitive position will not be
    adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the United
    States dollar against other currencies. Potential interest rate
    increases, as well as high energy costs, could have an adverse
    impact on industrial and consumer spending patterns and could
    adversely impact demand for our products. While a majority of
    our cash is generated outside the United States, we require a
    substantial amount of cash in the United Sates for operating
    requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends and
    acquisitions. If we are unable to address our U.S. cash
    requirements through operations, by efficient and timely
    repatriations of overseas cash, through borrowings under our
    current credit facility or from other sources of cash obtained
    at an acceptable cost, our business strategies and operating
    results could be adversely affected.

In addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in
    the semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic,
    political and legal risks inherent in international operations,
    including the risks associated with the current crisis in global
    credit and financial markets, ongoing uncertainties and
    political and economic instability in many countries around the
    world, as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism
    and the response to them by the United States and its allies.
    Other business risks associated with international operations
    include increased managerial complexities, air transportation
    disruptions, expropriation, currency controls, currency exchange
    rate movement, additional costs related to foreign taxes,
    tariffs and freight rate increases, exposure to different
    business practices and legal standards, particularly with
    respect to price protection, intellectual property and
    environmental compliance, trade and travel restrictions,
    pandemics, import and export license requirements and
    restrictions, difficulties in staffing and managing worldwide
    operations, and accounts receivable collections.

We expect to continue to expand our business and operations in
    China. Our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely
    affected by China’s continuously evolving laws and
    regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and
    export tariffs, currency controls, environmental regulations,
    and property rights. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements
    may be inconsistent, as there exists a high degree of
    fragmentation among regulatory authorities resulting in
    uncertainties as to which authorities have jurisdiction over
    particular parties or transactions. In addition, changes in the
    political environment, governmental policies or

U.S.-China

relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or
    their interpretation and enforcement, increased taxation,
    restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations,
    which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and
    operating results.

Our
    operating results are dependent on the performance of
    independent distributors.

A significant portion of our sales are through independent
    distributors that are not under our control. These independent
    distributors generally represent product lines offered by
    several companies and thus could reduce their



sales efforts applied to our products or terminate their
    representation of us. We generally do not require letters of
    credit from our distributors and are not protected against
    accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors.
    Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could
    adversely affect our operating results. Termination of a
    significant distributor, whether at our initiative or the
    distributor’s initiative, could disrupt our current
    business, and if we are unable to find suitable replacements,
    our operating results could be adversely affected.

We are
    subject to increasingly strict environmental regulations, which
    could increase our expenses and affect our operating
    results.

Our industry is subject to increasingly strict environmental
    regulations that control and restrict the use, transportation,
    emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals,
    gases and other substances used or produced in the semiconductor
    manufacturing process. Public attention on environmental
    controls has increased, and our customers routinely include
    stringent environmental standards in their contracts with us.
    Changes in environmental regulations may require us to invest in
    potentially costly remediation equipment or alter the way our
    products are made. In addition, we use hazardous and other
    regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability
    for damages caused by accidental releases, regardless of fault.
    Any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply
    with regulatory restrictions or contractual obligations could
    increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results.

New climate change regulations could require us to change our
    manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may
    cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations.
    In addition, new restrictions on carbon dioxide or other
    greenhouse gas emissions could result in significant costs for
    us. Greenhouse gas legislation has been introduced in
    Massachusetts and the United States legislatures and we expect
    increased worldwide regulatory activity in the future. The cost
    of complying, or of failing to comply, with these and other
    climate change and emissions regulations could have an adverse
    effect on our business plans and operating results.

Our stock
    price may be volatile.

The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the
    past and may be volatile in the future, as it may be
    significantly affected by the following factors:

•

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating
    results;

•

the current crisis in global credit and financial markets;

•

changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our
    failure to perform in line with such estimates or our published
    guidance;

•

changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies;

•

announcements by us or our competitors of significant new
    products, technical innovations, acquisitions or dispositions,
    litigation or capital commitments;

•

departures of key personnel;

•

actual or perceived noncompliance with corporate responsibility
    or ethics standards by us or any of our employees, officers or
    directors; and

•

negative media publicity targeting us or our competitors.

The stock market has historically experienced volatility,
    especially within the semiconductor industry, that often has
    been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. These
    market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless
    of our operating results.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

Settlement
    of the SEC’s Previously Announced Stock Option
    Investigation

On May 30, 2008, we and our President and CEO,
    Mr. Jerald G. Fishman, reached a settlement with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission, thereby concluding the
    Commission’s investigation into our stock option granting
    practices. Neither we nor Mr. Fishman admitted or denied
    any of the Commission’s allegations or findings.

As previously disclosed, the Commission concluded that: the
    appropriate grant date for the September 4, 1998 options
    should have been September 8, 1998 (which is one trading
    day later than the date that was used to price the options); the
    appropriate grant date for the November 30, 1999 options
    should have been November 29, 1999 (which is one trading
    day earlier than the date that was used to price the options);
    and the appropriate grant date for the July 18, 2001
    options should have been July 26, 2001 (which is five
    trading days later than the date that was used to price the
    options).

In connection with the settlement, we consented to a

cease-and-desist

order under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act
    and

Rule 10b-5

thereunder, paid a civil money penalty of $3 million, and
    repriced options granted to Mr. Fishman in 1999 and 2001.
    No other options granted by us were affected by the settlement.
    Mr. Fishman consented to a

cease-and-desist

order under Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the
    Securities Act, paid a civil money penalty of $1 million,
    and made a disgorgement payment of $450,000 (plus interest) with
    respect to options granted in 1998.

We determined that no restatement of our historical financial
    results is necessary due to the settlement.

Other
    Legal Proceedings

On October 13, 2006, a purported class action complaint was
    filed in the United States District Court for the District of
    Massachusetts on behalf of participants in our Investment
    Partnership Plan from October 5, 2000 to the present. The
    complaint named us, certain of our officers and directors, and
    our Investment Partnership Plan Administration Committee as
    defendants. The complaint alleged purported violations of
    federal law in connection with our option granting practices
    during the years 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001, including breaches
    of fiduciary duties owed to participants and beneficiaries of
    our Investment Partnership Plan under the Employee Retirement
    Income Security Act. The complaint sought unspecified monetary
    damages, as well as equitable and injunctive relief. On
    October 22, 2008, the parties filed a stipulation of
    dismissal with prejudice of this matter and each party agreed to
    dismiss its claims against the other party, thereby concluding
    this matter without any payment by us to the other party.

From time to time in the ordinary course of our business,
    various claims, charges and litigation are asserted or commenced
    against us arising from, or related to, contractual matters,
    patents, trademarks, personal injury, environmental matters,
    product liability, insurance coverage and personnel and
    employment disputes. As to such claims and litigation, we can
    give no assurance that we will prevail.

While we do not believe that any current legal matters will have
    a material adverse effect on our financial position, an adverse
    outcome of any of these matters is possible and could have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated results of
    operations or cash flows in the quarter or annual period in
    which one or more of these matters are resolved.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS (all tabular amounts in thousands except per share
    amounts)

This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations, including in particular the
    section entitled “Outlook” contains forward-looking
    statements regarding future events and our future results that
    are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act
    of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). These
    statements are based on current expectations, estimates,
    forecasts, and projections about the industries in which we
    operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Words
    such as “expects,” “anticipates,”
    “targets,” “goals,” “projects,”
    “intends,” “plans,” “believes,”
    “seeks,” “estimates,” “continues,”
    “may,” variations of such words and similar
    expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking
    statements. In addition, any statements that refer to

During the first quarter of fiscal 2008 we sold our baseband
    chipset business and related support operations, or Baseband
    Chipset Business, to MediaTek Inc. and sold our CPU voltage
    regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to certain
    subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation. The financial
    results of these businesses are presented as discontinued
    operations in the consolidated statements of income for all
    periods presented. The assets and liabilities related to these
    businesses are reflected as assets and liabilities of
    discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets as of
    November 1, 2008 and November 3, 2007. The historical
    results of operations of these businesses have been segregated
    from our consolidated financial statements and are included in
    income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the
    consolidated statements of income. Unless otherwise noted, this
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis relates only to
    financial results from continuing operations.

The year-to-year revenue changes by end market and product
    category are more fully outlined below under

Revenue Trends
    by End Market

and

Revenue Trends by Product

.

In fiscal year 2008, our product revenue increased 6% from
    fiscal 2007 and our diluted earnings per share from continuing
    operations increased by 17%. We sold two businesses during the
    year that resulted in net cash proceeds of $403 million and
    a $248 million net gain in fiscal 2008. We report these two
    businesses below as discontinued operations. Our fiscal 2008
    cash flow from operations was $669 million, or 26% of
    revenue, and we had $1,310 million of cash and short-term
    investments and no debt as of November 1, 2008.



While we achieved good operating results for fiscal 2008, the
    global credit crisis and deteriorating economic conditions have
    resulted in more cautious customer spending behavior and
    generally lower demand for our products. We cannot predict the
    severity, duration or precise impact of the economic downturn on
    our future financial results. Consequently, our reported results
    for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2008 may not be
    indicative of our future results.

Order rates slowed in late September 2008, and backlog declined
    significantly from the prior quarter, which limits our
    short-term visibility. Forecasting revenue in this environment
    is difficult. Therefore, as more fully described in the Outlook
    section below, our operating plan is for revenues to decline
    approximately 20% in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 from the
    amount recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.

Revenue
    Trends by End Market

The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using
    a variety of data points including the technical characteristics
    of the product, the “sold to” customer information,
    the “ship to” customer information and the end
    customer product or application into which our product will be
    incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this
    data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end
    market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify
    revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications
    typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the
    underlying trends of results within, each end market.

The year ended November 3, 2007 was a 53-week year. We
    follow a 52-week, or

364-day

fiscal calendar that results in a 53-week year approximately
    every seventh year, as occurred in fiscal 2007.

Industrial —

The year-to-year increase from
    fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of revenue
    growth in products sold into the instrumentation and automotive
    sectors and, to a lesser extent, the defense sector. These
    increases were partially offset by a decline in revenue from
    automatic test equipment. The year-to-year increase from fiscal
    2006 to fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of revenue growth
    in products sold into the automotive area and to a lesser extent
    the instrumentation portion of the industrial end market. These
    sales increases were partially offset by a decline in sales to
    automatic test equipment customers.

Communications —

The year-to-year increases
    from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 and from fiscal 2006 to fiscal
    2007 were primarily the result of revenue growth in sales of
    analog products used in basestations and wireless handsets. The
    increase in sales from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was partially
    offset by a decrease in sales to networking customers.

Consumer —

The year-to-year decrease from
    fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of an
    increase in revenue from advanced television and digital camera
    applications that was offset by a decline in revenue from other
    consumer applications, consistent with the global slowdown in
    consumer spending. The year-to-year increase from fiscal 2006 to
    fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of increased sales of our
    products used in video game applications, advanced television
    systems and digital home applications.



Computer —

The year-to-year decreases from
    fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 and from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007
    were primarily the result of broad-based declines in sales of
    our products into this end market.

Revenue from One-Time IP License —

During the
    first quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded revenue of
    $35 million received in exchange for licensing of certain
    intellectual property rights to a third party.

Revenue
    Trends by Product

The following table summarizes revenue by product categories.
    The categorization of our products into broad categories is
    based on the characteristics of the individual products, the
    specification of the products and in some cases the specific
    uses that certain products have within applications. The
    categorization of products into categories is therefore subject
    to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances
    where products move between product categories we reclassify the
    amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such
    reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing
    of, or the underlying trends of results within, each product
    category.

The year ended November 3, 2007 was a 53-week year. We
    follow a 52-week, or

364-day

fiscal calendar that results in a 53-week year approximately
    every seventh year, as occurred in fiscal 2007.

The increase in sales from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 was the
    result of a broad-based increase in sales across many of our
    product categories. The increase in sales of converters and
    amplifiers was primarily attributable to an increase in demand
    for our products used in the industrial and communications end
    markets.

The significant changes in our revenue trends by product type
    from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 were the year-to-year increases
    in our converters and amplifiers. In addition the other analog
    product category increased primarily as a result of increased
    sales of products used in video game applications. The
    year-to-year decrease from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 in the
    other DSP product category was primarily attributable to the
    loss of revenue from our DSP-based DSL ASIC and network
    processor product line that we sold in fiscal 2006. This
    decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenues from
    our general purpose DSP products.

Revenue in the United States declined from 24% to 20% of total
    revenue over the past three fiscal years. This geographic shift
    of revenue reflects the increased manufacturing activity of our
    customers in locations outside the United States, primarily
    China and our success in markets located outside of the United
    States.

Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2008 was lower by
    10 basis points from the gross margin recorded in fiscal
    2007. Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2007 was higher
    primarily as a result of recording revenue of $35 million
    we received in exchange for the licensing of certain
    intellectual property rights to a third party with no associated
    cost of sales.

Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2007 decreased by
    70 basis points from the gross margin recorded in fiscal
    2006. This decrease was primarily the result of higher sales of
    products used in consumer electronics in fiscal 2007, which were
    primarily manufactured at external foundries where we earned
    lower gross margins compared to our average gross margin. This
    gross margin percentage decrease in fiscal 2007 was partially
    offset by the $35 million in revenue recorded in the first
    quarter of fiscal 2007 in exchange for licensing of certain
    intellectual property rights to a third party with no associated
    cost of sales. Fiscal year 2006 cost of sales also included
    approximately $20.3 million of restructuring-related
    expenses, of which $18.3 million was accelerated
    depreciation.

Stock-based
    Compensation Expense

During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, on October 30,
    2005, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS,
    No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment,

or
    SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective transition
    method. We calculate compensation cost on the date of grant
    using the fair value of stock options as calculated using the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model. As of November 1, 2008,
    the total compensation cost related to unvested awards not yet
    recognized in the statement of income was approximately
    $116.7 million (before tax consideration), which will be
    recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years. See
    Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for further information regarding our adoption of SFAS 123R.

R&D expenses in fiscal 2008 increased by
    $23.9 million, or 5%, from the amount recorded in fiscal
    2007. This increase was primarily the result of higher employee
    salary, benefit and bonus expenses, which were partially offset
    by one fewer week of operations in fiscal 2008 than in fiscal
    2007 and lower employee stock option expenses.

R&D expenses in fiscal 2007 increased by
    $49.7 million, or 11%, from the amount recorded in fiscal
    2006. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily the result
    of an increase in employee salary and benefit expense in fiscal
    2007, primarily as a result of an increase in our employee
    population and to a lesser extent the impact of the extra week
    of operations in fiscal 2007. These increases were partially
    offset by lower employee bonus expenses during fiscal 2007 as
    compared to fiscal 2006.

R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from
    year-to-year depending on the amount of revenue and the success
    of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to
    our future growth. At any point in time we have hundreds of
    R&D projects underway, and we believe that none of these
    projects is material on an individual basis. We expect to
    continue the development of innovative technologies and
    processes for new products, and we believe that a continued
    commitment to R&D is essential in order to maintain product
    leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative
    new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to
    make significant R&D investments in the future.

    regarding these acquisitions.

Special
    Charges

Closure
    of Wafer Fabrication Facility in Sunnyvale

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we recorded a special
    charge of $20.3 million as a result of a decision to close
    our California wafer fabrication operations and transfer
    virtually all of the production of products manufactured there
    to our facility in Wilmington, Massachusetts. The charge was for
    severance and fringe benefit costs that we recorded pursuant to
    SFAS 88,

Employers’ Accounting for Settlements and
    Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for
    Termination Benefits

, or SFAS 88, under our ongoing
    benefit plan for 339 manufacturing employees and 28 general and
    administrative employees. The severance benefit is based on the
    length of past service, and employees had to continue to be
    employed until their employment was involuntarily terminated in
    order to receive the severance benefit. We completed the final
    cleanup and closure activities associated with this action
    during the second quarter of fiscal 2007.

In addition we recorded additional expense during fiscal 2006
    related to the Sunnyvale facility closure, which consisted of
    $18.3 million of non-cash cost of sales expenses for
    additional depreciation due to shortened useful lives of certain
    manufacturing equipment and $2.0 million for stay-on
    bonuses for certain employees critical to facilitating the
    closure of this facility. We reversed approximately
    $2.0 million of the severance accrual during fiscal 2006
    because some employees voluntarily left the company and other
    employees found alternative employment within the company. In
    addition, there was an over-accrual related to fringe benefits
    because severance payments, normally paid as income continuance,
    were paid in lump sum payments, which reduced the benefit costs
    associated with these payments. We have terminated the
    employment of all of the employees included in this action.

We ceased production at the wafer fabrication facility on
    November 9, 2006. During the first quarter of fiscal 2007,
    we recorded additional expense, in accordance with
    SFAS 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
    Disposal Activities

or, SFAS 146, which consisted of
    $3.2 million for

clean-up

and
    closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred and
    $0.4 million for lease obligation costs for a warehouse
    facility we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal
    2007. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a
    special charge, in accordance with SFAS 146, which included
    $5.0 million of expense for future lease obligation costs
    for the wafer fabrication facility that we ceased using during
    the second quarter of fiscal 2007. The lease obligation costs
    are being paid out on a monthly basis over the remaining lease
    term, which expires in 2010. Also included in this special
    charge was $1.7 million for facility

clean-up

and
    closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred. We
    completed the

clean-up

activity during the second quarter of fiscal 2007, and we do not
    expect to incur any additional charges related to this action.

The closure of this facility has resulted in annual cost savings
    of approximately $50 million per year beginning in fiscal
    2007. These annual savings include: approximately
    $49 million in cost of sales, of which approximately
    $7 million relates to non-cash depreciation savings, and
    approximately $1 million in SMG&A expenses. At current
    demand levels, if this facility were still in operation, the
    capacity of the facility would be largely underutilized
    resulting in significant adverse manufacturing variances
    associated with the underutilization of our wafer fabrication
    facilities.

Reorganization
    of Product Development and Support Programs

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we recorded a special
    charge of $11.2 million as a result of our decision to
    reorganize our product development and support programs with the
    goal of providing greater focus on our analog and digital signal
    processing product programs. The charge was for severance and
    fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our
    ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign
    locations for 60 manufacturing employees and 154 engineering and
    selling, marketing, general and administrative employees
    associated with these programs.

During fiscal 2006, we recorded an additional special charge of
    $3.8 million related to this reorganization action.
    Approximately $1.5 million of this charge was for lease
    obligation costs for a facility that we ceased using



during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and the write-off of
    property, plant and equipment and other items at this facility.
    The remaining $2.3 million related to the severance and
    fringe benefit costs recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal
    2006 pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or
    statutory requirements at foreign locations for
    46 engineering and selling, marketing, general and
    administrative employees associated with these programs.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded an
    additional special charge of $1.6 million related to this
    reorganization action. Approximately $0.6 million of this
    charge was for contract termination costs. The remaining
    $1.0 million relates to severance and fringe benefit costs
    recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan
    for six engineering employees associated with these programs.
    During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded an
    additional special charge of $3.4 million related to this
    reorganization action. Approximately $3.2 million related
    to the severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to
    SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or minimum statutory
    requirements at foreign locations for 20 engineering and
    selling, marketing, general and administrative employees. The
    remaining $0.2 million of this charge was for lease
    obligation costs for a facility that we ceased using during the
    second quarter of fiscal 2007. During the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2007, we reversed approximately $0.9 million of our
    severance accrual because some employees voluntarily left the
    company and other employees found alternative employment within
    the company, and were therefore no longer entitled to severance
    payments.

The employment of all employees associated with these programs
    has been terminated and amounts owed to employees for severance
    are being paid out as income continuance. We do not expect to
    incur any further charges related to this reorganization action.
    These organizational changes, which were fully implemented in
    the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, have resulted in savings of
    approximately $30 million per year. These annual savings
    include: approximately $17 million in R&D expenses,
    approximately $10 million in SMG&A expenses and
    approximately $3 million in cost of sales. As this action
    was completed during fiscal 2007, a portion of these annual
    savings is reflected in our results for fiscal 2007 and all of
    the annual savings are reflected in our fiscal 2008 results.

Fourth
    Quarter of Fiscal 2007 Special Charges

Consolidation
    of a Wafer Fabrication Facility in Limerick

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a special
    charge of $13.7 million as a result of our decision to only
    use eight-inch technology at our wafer fabrication facility in
    Limerick. Certain manufacturing processes and products produced
    on the Limerick facility’s six-inch production line will
    transition to our existing eight-inch production line in
    Limerick while others will transition to external foundries. The
    charge is for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded
    pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan for 150
    manufacturing employees associated with these action. As of
    November 1, 2008, 126 of the 150 employees included in
    this cost reduction action were still employed by us. We expect
    production to cease in the six-inch wafer fabrication facility
    during the first half of 2009, at which time the employment of
    the remaining affected employees will be terminated. These
    employees must continue to be employed by us until their
    employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the
    severance benefit. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we
    recorded an additional charge of $1.5 million related to
    this action, of which $1.2 million was an adjustment to our
    original estimate of the severance costs and $0.3 million
    was for

clean-up

and
    closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred. We
    expect to incur additional

clean-up

and
    closure costs related to this action over the next three
    quarters totaling approximately $1.5 million. In accordance
    with SFAS 146, we will expense these costs as incurred. We
    estimate that the closure of this facility will result in annual
    cost savings of approximately $25 million per year,
    expected to start during the second quarter of fiscal 2009. We
    expect these annual savings will be in cost of sales, of which
    approximately $1 million relates to non-cash depreciation
    savings.

Reduction
    of Overhead Infrastructure Costs

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we decided to either
    deemphasize or exit certain businesses or products and focus
    investments in products and end markets where we have better
    opportunities for profitable growth. In September 2007, we
    entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Baseband Chipset
    Business. As a result, we decided to reduce the support
    infrastructure in manufacturing, engineering and SMG&A to
    more appropriately reflect our required overhead structure.
    Consequently, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we



recorded a special charge of $12.3 million, of which
    $10.7 million was for severance and fringe benefit costs
    recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan
    or statutory requirements at foreign locations for
    25 manufacturing employees and 127 engineering and selling,
    marketing, general and administrative employees associated with
    this action. The remaining $1.6 million was for contract
    termination costs related to a license agreement associated with
    products we will no longer develop and for which there is no
    future alternative use. As of November 1, 2008, we still
    employed 6 of the 152 employees included in this cost
    reduction action. These employees must continue to be employed
    by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in
    order to receive the severance benefit. We expect these cost
    reduction actions, which were substantially completed in the
    second quarter of fiscal 2008, to result in savings of
    approximately $15 million per year. We expect these savings
    to be realized as follows: approximately $7 million in
    R&D expenses, approximately $6 million in SMG&A
    expenses and approximately $2 million in cost of sales. A
    portion of these savings is reflected in our results for fiscal
    2008.

Fourth
    Quarter of 2008 Special Charge

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we decided to further
    reduce the operating cost structure of our company.
    Consequently, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we
    recorded a special charge of $1.6 million for severance and
    fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our
    ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign
    locations for 19 engineering and SMG&A employees. As of
    November 1, 2008 we still employed, 14 of the
    19 employees included in this cost reduction action. These
    employees must continue to be employed by us until their
    employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the
    severance benefit. We expect this cost reduction action, which
    we expect to complete during the first quarter of fiscal 2009,
    to result in savings of approximately $2.1 million per
    year. We expect these savings to be realized as follows:
    approximately $0.5 million in R&D expenses and
    approximately $1.6 million in SMG&A expenses.

The $56.3 million, or 10%, increase in operating income in
    fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily the result
    of an increase in total revenue of $118.2 million and, to a
    lesser extent, a decrease in special charges of
    $37.4 million. This increase in operating income from
    continuing operations was partially offset by a 10 basis
    point decrease in gross margin percentage, an increase in
    operating expenses as more fully described above under the
    headings

Research and Development

and

    Marketing, General and Administrative

, and the fact that
    fiscal 2007 included $35 million in non-product revenue
    that we received in exchange for the licensing of certain
    intellectual property rights to a third party with no associated
    cost of sales.

Operating income increased by $42.5 million, or 8%, in
    fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. This increase was the
    result of a $214.6 million increase in revenue, which was
    partially offset by a 70 basis point decrease in gross
    margin percentage and a $72.2 million increase in operating
    expenses as more fully described above under the headings

Nonoperating income in fiscal 2008 was lower by
    $51.7 million as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily as a
    result of lower average invested cash balances and, to a lesser
    extent, lower interest rates in fiscal 2008 as compared



to fiscal 2007. In addition, other income in fiscal 2007
    included $10.5 million we received as part of a litigation
    settlement and a $7.9 million gain from the sale of an
    investment.

The $17.9 million decrease in nonoperating income in fiscal
    2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was a result of lower invested
    cash balances that were partially offset by the higher interest
    rates in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. This decrease
    in interest income was partially offset by a $7.9 million
    gain from the sale of an investment and a $10.5 million
    settlement we received in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2006, we also
    recognized a $13.0 million gain on the sale of our
    DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product line.

Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in
    effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where
    our income is earned.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was lower by
    290 basis points compared to our effective tax rate for
    fiscal 2007. The 2007 tax rate included the following
    transactions, which were taxed at the higher U.S. tax rate:
    the one-time receipt of $35 million associated with the
    licensing of intellectual property to a third party,
    $19 million we received from a settlement of litigation and
    the $7.9 million gain on the sale of an investment. In
    addition, the 2007 tax rate included tax expense related to the
    finalization of the accounting for a 2006 acquisition. These
    items, which had the effect of increasing the 2007 tax rate,
    were partially offset by a higher R&D credit in fiscal 2007
    than in fiscal 2008. In addition to these isolated transactions
    that impacted our tax rate, a larger percentage of our profits
    were earned in lower tax jurisdictions during fiscal 2008, as
    compared to fiscal 2007 causing a decrease in our tax rate.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 was higher by
    550 basis points compared to our effective tax rate for
    fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily attributable to the
    recording of tax benefits of $35.2 million associated with
    the completion of an Internal Revenue Service, or IRS,
    examination during fiscal 2006, including the reversal of
    penalty accruals and the filing of refund claims in other
    jurisdictions associated with the completion of the IRS audit.
    The increase was also attributable to the following fiscal 2007
    transactions, which were taxed at the higher U.S. tax rate:
    the one-time receipt of $35 million associated with the
    licensing of intellectual property to a third party, the gain on
    the sale of an investment of $7.9 million and
    $19 million received from the settlement of litigation. In
    addition, we recorded an additional $4.4 million of taxes
    and penalties in fiscal 2007 for proposed adjustments related to
    the IRS examination of fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 and a
    $5.6 million tax adjustment related to the finalization of
    the accounting associated with a fiscal 2006 acquisition. These
    items were partially offset by a tax benefit of
    $4.7 million from the reinstatement of the
    U.S. federal research and development tax credit in fiscal
    2007 and a $9.9 million cumulative adjustment recorded in
    fiscal 2007 related to the application of this credit to a
    portion of our fiscal 2006 results.

Income from continuing operations, net of tax, in fiscal 2008
    was higher than in fiscal 2007 by approximately
    $23.1 million primarily as a result of the
    $56.3 million increase in operating income from continuing
    operations that was partially offset by a $51.7 million
    decrease in nonoperating income and a lower provision for income
    taxes in fiscal 2008.



Income from continuing operations, net of tax, was lower in
    fiscal 2007 than in fiscal 2006 by approximately
    $17.1 million primarily as a result of the
    $17.9 million decrease in nonoperating income and the
    impact of a higher effective income tax rate in fiscal 2007.
    These items, which had the impact of decreasing 2007 income from
    continuing operations, net of tax, were partially offset by the
    $42.5 million increase in operating income from continuing
    operations.

The impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate
    movement on our results of operations during the past three
    fiscal years has not been significant.

We sold our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc. and our
    CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to
    certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation during the
    first quarter of fiscal 2008. Accordingly, the results of the
    operations of these businesses have been presented as
    discontinued operations within the consolidated financial
    statements in accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets

.

Acquisitions

In fiscal 2006, we completed a transaction with TTPCom Limited
    (TTPCom), whereby TTPCom transferred to us intellectual
    property, engineering resources, and related assets associated
    with the support and customization of TTPCom’s
    GSM/GPRS/EDGE modem software for use on our existing and future
    generations of
    SoftFone

®

baseband processors. We also acquired development rights for
    AJAR, TTPCom’s advanced applications platform. As a result
    of this transaction, we became the single point of contact for
    both hardware and software support for our new and existing
    wireless handset customers, thus improving our ability to
    service the needs of individual customers. We paid TTPCom
    $11.9 million in initial cash payments. We allocated the
    purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired
    based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.
    The estimated fair values of the assets exceeded the initial
    payments by $7.8 million, resulting in negative goodwill.
    Pursuant to SFAS No. 141,

Business
    Combinations

, we recorded a liability for the contingent
    consideration that was accounted for as additional purchase
    price, up to the amount of the negative goodwill. As contingent
    payments became due, we applied the payments against the
    contingent liability. As of October 28, 2006, we had paid
    $6 million of contingent payments and the remaining
    contingent liability was $1.8 million. The purchase price
    included $5.5 million of

in-process

technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility,
    had no alternative future use and was charged to operations
    during fiscal 2006. The in-process technology related to
    software code developed for use in our semiconductor chipsets
    manufactured for devices that use both the 2G and 2.5G cellular
    wireless technology standards. We determined the fair value of
    the in-process technology with the assistance of a third party
    using the income approach. At the time of the acquisition, the
    in-process technology was approximately 56% complete. We
    completed the in-process research and development projects
    during fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2007, we paid an additional
    $6.1 million of contingent consideration, which resulted in
    reducing the $1.8 million liability and recording
    additional goodwill of $4.3 million. All technological
    milestones have been met and no additional payments will be
    made. The acquisition also included $13.2 million of
    intangible assets that we were amortizing over their estimated
    useful lives of five years using an accelerated amortization
    method that reflects the estimated pattern of economic use. As a
    result of the sale of our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek
    Inc., we reclassified $7.9 million of net intangible assets
    to assets of discontinued operations at November 3, 2007
    and transferred them to MediaTek Inc. during the first quarter
    of fiscal 2008. See Note 2u. in the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

for additional information on assets of discontinued operations.



In fiscal 2006, we acquired substantially all the outstanding
    stock of privately-held Integrant Technologies, Inc. (Integrant)
    of Seoul, Korea. The acquisition enabled us to enter the mobile
    TV market and strengthened our presence in the Asian region. We
    paid $127.2 million in initial cash payments at closing and
    were obligated to make additional cash payments of up to an
    aggregate of $33 million upon the satisfaction of certain
    conditions. The initial cash payments included $4.2 million
    held in escrow for the purchase of the remaining non-founder
    outstanding shares. We purchased these shares during fiscal 2007
    and recorded them as additional goodwill. We allocated the
    purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired
    based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.
    We completed the final purchase accounting for this transaction
    during fiscal 2007, which resulted in an additional
    $5.6 million of goodwill. The $33 million of potential
    cash payments is comprised of $25 million for the
    achievement of revenue-based milestones during the period from
    July 2006 through December 2007, none of which were met, and
    $8.4 million related to the purchase of shares from the
    founder of Integrant during the period from July 2007 through
    July 2009. We recorded or will record these payments as
    additional purchase price. We have paid $6.3 million to
    repurchase founder shares through November 1, 2008 and will
    make the remaining $2.1 million payment during fiscal 2009.
    The purchase price included $11.1 million of in-process
    technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility,
    had no alternative future use and was charged to operations
    during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The in-process
    technology related to technologies currently in development for
    Dual DAB,

T-DMB,

DVB-H, RFID and WiBro applications. We determined the
    fair value of the in-process technology with the assistance of a
    third party using the income forecast approach. At the time of
    the acquisition, the in-process technology was approximately 74%
    complete. We completed the in-process research and development
    projects during fiscal 2007. The acquisition also included
    $21.6 million of intangible assets that we are amortizing
    over their estimated useful lives of two to five years using an
    accelerated amortization method that reflects the estimated
    pattern of economic use.

In fiscal 2006, we acquired all the outstanding stock of
    privately-held AudioAsics A/S (AudioAsics) of Roskilde, Denmark.
    The acquisition of AudioAsics allows us to continue developing
    low-power audio solutions, while expanding our presence in the
    Nordic and Eastern European regions. We paid $19.3 million
    in initial cash payments at closing and may be obligated to make
    additional cash payments of up to an aggregate of
    $8 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. We
    allocated the purchase price to the tangible and intangible
    assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date
    of acquisition. The $8 million of potential cash payments
    is comprised of $4.8 million for the achievement of
    revenue-based milestones that may be payable during the period
    from October 2006 through January 2009 and $3.2 million
    based on the achievement of technological milestones during the
    period from October 2006 through January 2009. If the
    revenue-based milestone is met by January 2009, it will be
    recorded as additional goodwill. The technological milestones
    required post-acquisition services to be rendered and, as such,
    we recorded them as compensation expense in fiscal 2008. These
    technological milestones were achieved during fiscal 2008 and
    will be paid during fiscal 2009. The purchase price included
    $5.1 million of in-process technology that had not yet
    reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use
    and was charged to operations during the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2006. The in-process technology related to technologies
    currently in development for analog and digital microphone

pre-amplifiers.

We determined the fair value of the

in-process

technology with the assistance of a third party using the income
    approach. At the time of the acquisition, the in-process
    technology was approximately 69% complete. We completed the
    in-process research and development projects during fiscal 2007.
    The acquisition also included $8.3 million of intangible
    assets that we are amortizing over their estimated useful lives
    of five years using an accelerated amortization method that
    reflects the estimated pattern of economic use.

We have not provided pro forma results of operations for TTPCom,
    Integrant and AudioAsics herein as they were not material to us
    on either an individual or an aggregate basis. We included the
    results of operations of each acquisition in our consolidated
    statement of income from the date of such acquisition.

At November 1, 2008, cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments totaled $1,309.7 million, an increase of
    $228.5 million from the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal
    2007. The primary sources of funds for fiscal 2008 were net cash
    generated from operating activities of $669.4 million,
    $403.2 million received from the sale of two businesses and
    proceeds of $94.2 million from the exercise of stock
    options. The principal uses of funds during fiscal 2008 were the
    repurchase of approximately 19.4 million shares of our
    common stock for an aggregate of $569.9 million, dividend
    payments of $222.5 million, and capital expenditures of
    $157.4 million. Included in the cash flow from operations
    is $110.4 million of tax payments related to the sale of
    the two businesses. Under SFAS No. 95,

Statement of
    Cash Flows,

all income tax payments are included in
    determining net cash flow from operating activities, but the
    cash received from the sale of the businesses must be reported
    as an investing cash inflow.

We sold our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc. and our
    CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to
    certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation during the
    first quarter of fiscal 2008. The cash flows from these
    discontinued operations have been combined with the operating,
    investing and financing cash flows from continuing operations
    (i.e. no separate classification of cash flows from discontinued
    operations) for all periods presented. We believe the absence of
    the cash flows from these discontinued operations will not have
    a material impact on our future liquidity and financial
    position. Additionally, as a result of these dispositions, we
    reclassified certain assets and liabilities related to these
    businesses to assets or liabilities of discontinued operations.
    See Note 2u. in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for further information regarding these discontinued operations.

We use the annualized fourth quarter revenue in our calculation
    of days sales outstanding and we use the annualized fourth
    quarter cost of sales in our calculation of days cost of sales
    in inventory.

Accounts receivable at the end of fiscal 2008 decreased by
    $8.5 million, or 3%, from the amount at the end of fiscal
    2007. This decrease was the result of lower product shipments in
    the last month of fiscal 2008 as compared to the last month of
    fiscal 2007.

Inventories at the end of fiscal 2008 decreased by
    $9.7 million, or 3%, from the amount at the end of fiscal
    2007 and days cost of sales in inventory at the end of fiscal
    2008 decreased by 7 days from the amount at the end of
    fiscal 2007. This decrease in inventory is primarily the result
    of lower revenue forecasted for the first quarter of fiscal 2009
    as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2008.

Current liabilities increased to $569.1 million at
    November 1, 2008, an increase of $21.0 million, or 4%,
    from $548.1 million at the end of fiscal 2007. This
    increase was primarily the result of an increase in accrued
    liabilities as a result of increases in compensation and benefit
    accruals and to a lesser extent an increase in deferred income
    on shipments to distributors as a result of our shipments to
    distributors in fiscal 2008 exceeding the distributors’
    sales to their end customers. These increases were partially
    offset by a decrease in accounts payable.

Net additions to property, plant and equipment including
    discontinued operations, were $157.4 million in fiscal
    2008, $141.8 million in fiscal 2007 and $129.3 million
    in fiscal 2006. We expect fiscal 2009 capital expenditures to
    total approximately $55 million.

During fiscal 2008, our Board of Directors declared cash
    dividends totaling $0.76 per outstanding share of common stock
    resulting in dividend payments of $222.5 million. The
    payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several
    factors, including our financial performance, outlook and
    liquidity. After the end of the fiscal year, on
    November 20, 2008, our Board of Directors declared a cash
    dividend of $0.20 per outstanding share of our common stock. The
    dividend is payable on December 24, 2008 to shareholders of
    record on December 5, 2008 and is expected to total
    approximately $58.2 million.



Our common stock repurchase program has been in place since
    August 2004. In the aggregate, the Board of Directors has
    authorized us to repurchase $4 billion of our common stock
    under the program. Under the program, we may repurchase
    outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the
    open market and through privately negotiated transactions.
    Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of
    Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have
    repurchased all shares authorized under the program. We
    repurchased approximately 19.4 million shares for
    approximately $569.9 million during fiscal 2008. As of
    November 1, 2008, we had repurchased a total of
    approximately 114.5 million shares of our common stock for
    approximately $3,904.7 million under this program and an
    additional $95.4 million remains under the current
    authorized program. The repurchased shares are held as
    authorized but unissued shares of common stock. We also from
    time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax
    withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock
    or restricted stock units or the exercise of stock options. Any
    future common stock repurchases will be dependent upon the
    amount of cash we have available to us in the United States.

At November 1, 2008, our principal source of liquidity was
    $1,309.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and
    short-term investments. As of November 1, 2008,
    approximately $89.0 million of our cash and cash
    equivalents and short-term investments were held in the United
    States. The balance of our cash and cash equivalents and
    short-term investments was held outside the United States in
    various foreign subsidiaries. As we intend to reinvest certain
    of our foreign earnings indefinitely, this cash is not available
    to meet certain of our cash requirements in the
    United States, including for cash dividends and common
    stock repurchases. As a result, we entered into a five-year $165
    million unsecured revolving credit facility in May 2008 in order
    to supplement our occasional cash requirements in the United
    States. To date, we have not borrowed under this credit facility
    but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for support
    of commercial paper issuance, stock repurchases, dividend
    payments, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital
    and other lawful corporate purposes.

The volatility in the credit markets has generally diminished
    liquidity and capital availability in worldwide markets. We are
    unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the
    current disruptions in the credit and financial markets and
    adverse global economic conditions. However, we believe that our
    existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated
    from future operations, together with existing and anticipated
    available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund
    operations, capital expenditures, research and development
    efforts, dividend payments (if any) and purchases of stock (if
    any) under our stock repurchase program for at least the next
    twelve months.

The table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the

(a)

Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation
    clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in
    the table.

(b)

These payments relate to obligations under our deferred
    compensation plan. The deferred compensation plan allows certain
    members of management and other highly-compensated employees and
    non-employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of
    their compensation. Prior to January 1, 2005, participants
    could also defer gains on stock options and restricted stock
    granted before July 23, 1997. The amount in the “More
    than 5 Years” column of the table represents the
    remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to
    be paid to participants who have not terminated employment.
    Since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals
    for participants who have not yet terminated employment we have
    included the future obligation



to these participants in the “More than 5 Years”
    column of the table. All other columns represent installment
    payments to be made to those employees who have retired or are
    on long-term disability.

(c)

Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is
    consistent with the local requirements of each country. The
    payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected
    contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2009. The actual
    future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the
    table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are
    not practical because of potential future changes in variables
    such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of
    increase in compensation levels.

Purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other
    goods and services are not included in the table above. We are
    not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders
    that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may
    represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding
    agreements. In addition, our purchase orders generally allow for
    cancellation without significant penalties. We do not have
    significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or
    other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that
    exceed our expected short-term requirements.

As of November 1, 2008, our total liabilities associated
    with uncertain tax positions under FIN 48 was
    $20.2 million, which are included in “Other
    non-current liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet
    contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

as a result of our adoption of FIN 48. Due to the
    complexity associated with our tax uncertainties, we cannot make
    a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect
    to settle the non-current liabilities associated with these
    uncertain tax positions. Therefore, we have not included these
    uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations
    table.

The expected timing of payments and the amounts of the
    obligations discussed above are estimated based on current
    information.

Off-balance
    Sheet Financing

As of November 1, 2008, we had no off-balance sheet
    financing arrangements.

Outlook

The following statements are based on current expectations.
    These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may
    differ materially. Unless specifically mentioned, these
    statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any
    mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or business combinations
    that may be announced or closed after the date of filing this
    report. These statements supersede all prior statements
    regarding business outlook made by us.

The global credit crisis and deteriorating economic conditions
    have resulted in more cautious customer spending behavior and
    generally lower demand. Order rates slowed in late September
    2008, and backlog declined significantly from the prior quarter,
    which limits our short-term visibility into future revenues.
    Forecasting revenue in this environment is difficult. Our
    operating plan is for revenue to decline approximately 20% in
    the first quarter of fiscal 2009 from revenue in the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2008. We are planning to take steps to avoid a
    large inventory buildup by significantly reducing manufacturing
    output, which we expect will temporarily impact our gross margin
    by approximately 3 to 4 percentage points. We are therefore
    planning for gross margin to be approximately 57% to 58% in the
    first quarter of fiscal 2009, depending on the actual product
    mix and level of sales we achieve. Further, we are planning to
    take actions in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 that we expect
    will result in operating expense reductions from fourth quarter
    levels of approximately 10%, or $25 million. We expect to
    realize over half of that savings in the first quarter of fiscal
    2009 and the balance in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. As a
    result of these anticipated actions, we plan to record a
    restructuring charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are
    currently in the process of finalizing our plans to reduce costs
    and are unable to determine the amount of the restructuring
    charge at this point. Assuming these levels of sales and
    resulting gross margin, anticipated cost reductions, and an
    effective tax rate of 22%, we expect diluted earnings per share
    from continuing operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2009
    to be approximately $0.22 to $0.23, excluding restructuring
    charges.

We are responding to the current economic environment by taking
    actions that we expect will reduce expenses in the short-term
    while strengthening our position for the long-term. We
    anticipate that our variable and discretionary cost reductions
    will fluctuate with general economic conditions, while the
    actions related to realigning our product



portfolio and streamlining our manufacturing infrastructure will
    result in short-term savings as well as a lower cost structure.
    While we believe that we have taken steps to mitigate the
    short-term reduction in our earnings and position ourselves for
    significant earnings leverage when growth resumes, there can be
    no assurances that market conditions will improve or that our
    actions will be sufficient to counteract those market conditions.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities

In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (SFAS) No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities — an amendment of
    FASB Statement No. 133

(SFAS 161). SFAS 161
    changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments
    and hedging activities. SFAS 161 requires entities to
    provide enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses
    derivative instruments; how derivative instruments and related
    hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133 and its
    related interpretations; and how derivative instruments and
    related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position,
    financial performance and cash flows. This statement is
    effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and
    interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. We are
    currently evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 161 may
    have on our financial condition and results of operations. The
    adoption of SFAS 161 will change our disclosures for
    derivative instruments and hedging activities beginning in the
    second quarter of fiscal year 2009.

Business
    Combinations

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007),

Business Combinations

(SFAS 141R).
    SFAS 141R requires an acquiring entity in a business
    combination to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities
    assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their
    fair value on the acquisition date. It further requires that
    acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs be recognized
    separately from the acquisition. SFAS 141R is effective for
    fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, which is
    our fiscal year 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact, if
    any, that SFAS 141R may have on our financial condition and
    results of operations. The adoption of SFAS 141R will
    change our accounting treatment for business combinations on a
    prospective basis beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year
    2010.

Noncontrolling
    Interests

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements

(SFAS 160). SFAS 160 clarifies that a
    noncontrolling or minority interest in a subsidiary is
    considered an ownership interest and, accordingly, requires all
    entities to report such interests in subsidiaries as equity in
    the consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008, which is our fiscal year 2010. We are currently evaluating
    the impact, if any, that SFAS 160 may have on our financial
    condition and results of operations.

Accounting
    for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

In February 2007, the FASB, issued SFAS No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115

(SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits entities
    to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain
    other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial
    reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate
    volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related
    assets and liabilities differently without having to apply
    complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective
    for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, which
    is our fiscal year 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact,
    if any, that SFAS 159 may have on our financial condition
    and results of operations.

Fair
    Value Measurements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(SFAS 157). SFAS 157
    provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure
    assets and liabilities. The standard also provides for expanded
    information about the extent to which companies measure assets
    and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure
    fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on
    earnings. SFAS 157 applies



whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities
    to be measured at fair value. This standard does not expand the
    use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS 157 is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2007, which is our fiscal year 2009. The adoption of
    SFAS 157 in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 will not
    materially impact our financial condition and results of
    operations. The adoption of SFAS 157 will expand our
    disclosures pertaining to the measurement of assets and
    liabilities beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of the financial
    condition and results of operations is based upon the
    consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
    accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles. The preparation of these financial statements
    requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
    reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses,
    and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We
    base our estimates and judgments on historical experience,
    knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur
    in the future based on available information. We consider the
    following accounting policies to be both those most important to
    the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require
    the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ
    significantly from management’s estimates and projections,
    there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We
    also have other policies that we consider key accounting
    policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including
    the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the
    products are sold to the end user; however, the application of
    these policies does not require us to make significant estimates
    or judgments that are difficult or subjective.

Inventory
    Valuation

We value inventories at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of
    the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels,
    obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write
    down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of
    methodologies to determine the net realizable value of
    inventory. While a portion of the calculation is determined via
    reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market
    calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to
    significant judgments made by us about future demand for our
    inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our
    estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may
    need to be recorded in future periods. To date our actual
    results have not been materially different than our estimates,
    and we do not expect them to be materially different in the
    future.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate,
    for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our
    customers to make required payments. If the financial condition
    of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may
    exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be
    required. To date our actual results have not been materially
    different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be
    materially different in the future.

Long-Lived
    Assets

We review property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets
    for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be
    recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by
    comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash
    flows that the assets are expected to generate over their
    remaining economic lives. If such assets are considered to be
    impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the
    amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their
    fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any,
    or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow
    technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment
    adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and
    identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years,
    except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions,
    deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such
    impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of
    impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future
    operating results that are used in the preparation of the
    expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating
    results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived
    assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the
    recoverability of these assets. These differences could result
    in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse
    impact on our



results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets
    may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have
    decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net
    book values over the revised useful lives.

Goodwill

In accordance with SFAS 142,

Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets

, goodwill is subject to annual impairment
    tests, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist
    and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be
    recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. Because
    we have one reporting segment under SFAS 142, we utilize
    the entity-wide approach to assess goodwill for impairment and
    compare our market value to our net book value to determine if
    an impairment exists. These impairment tests may result in
    impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on
    our results of operations.

Accounting
    for Income Taxes

We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining
    income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These
    estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits,
    benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax
    assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the
    timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and
    financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and
    penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. We assessed
    the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and
    concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the
    amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due
    to the expiration of certain state credit carryovers. In
    reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria
    including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be
    used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior
    carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be
    used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future
    years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change
    due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or
    international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any,
    may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets,
    resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net
    loss in the period when such determinations are made, which in
    turn, may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision
    in a subsequent period.

On November 4, 2007 (the first day of our 2008 fiscal
    year), we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting
    for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109

(FIN 48). FIN 48
    differs from the prior standards in that it requires companies
    to determine that it is “more likely than not” that a
    tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing
    authorities before any benefit can be recorded in the financial
    statements. An uncertain income tax position is not recognized
    if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. For
    those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax
    benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount
    of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of
    being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority
    that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those
    income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a
    tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been
    recognized in the financial statements. We reevaluate these
    uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is
    based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in known
    facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled
    issues under audit, and new audit activity. A change in these
    factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an
    additional charge to the tax provision.

In the ordinary course of global business, there are many
    transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is
    uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of
    cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related
    entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no
    assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these
    matters will not be different than that which is reflected in
    our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In the event
    our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a
    material impact on our income tax provision and operating
    results in the period in which such determination is made.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The adoption of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of fiscal
    2006 required that stock-based compensation expense associated
    with stock options and related awards be recognized in the
    statement of income, rather than being disclosed in a pro forma
    footnote to the consolidated financial statements. Determining
    the amount of stock-based



compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to
    be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock
    options. We calculate the grant-date fair values using the
    Black-Scholes valuation model. The use of valuation models
    requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions:

Expected volatility

— We are responsible for
    estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors,
    including third-party estimates, when estimating volatility. We
    currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility
    results in the best estimate of the grant-date fair value of
    employee stock options because it reflects the market’s
    current expectations of future volatility. In evaluating the
    appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility, we
    concluded that: (1) options in the Company’s common
    stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on several
    exchanges; (2) the market prices of both the traded options
    and the underlying shares are measured at a similar point in
    time to each other and on a date close to the grant date of the
    employee share options; (3) the traded options have
    exercise prices that are both

near-the-money

and close to the exercise price of the employee share options;
    and (4) the maturities of the traded options used to
    estimate volatility are at least one year.

Expected term

— We use historical employee
    exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected
    term assumption for the Black-Scholes grant-date valuation. We
    believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate
    of the expected term of a new option, and that generally, all of
    our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior. In general, the
    longer the expected term used in the Black-Scholes valuation
    model, the higher the grant-date fair value of the option.

Risk-free interest rate

— The yield on
    zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is
    commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the
    risk-free interest rate.

Expected dividend yield

— Expected dividend
    yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by
    our Board of Directors for the current quarter and dividing that
    result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the
    option. Until such time as our Board of Directors declares a
    cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current
    quarter’s cash dividend, the current dividend will be used
    in deriving this assumption. Cash dividends are not paid on
    options, restricted stock or restricted stock units.

The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized during
    a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that
    are ultimately expected to vest. SFAS 123R requires
    forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if
    necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ
    from those estimates. The term “forfeitures” is
    distinct from “cancellations” or
    “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion
    of the surrendered option. Based on an analysis of our
    historical forfeitures, we have applied an annual forfeiture
    rate of 4.3% to all unvested stock-based awards as of
    November 1, 2008. The rate of 4.3% represents the portion
    that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting
    period. This analysis is re-evaluated quarterly and the
    forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the actual
    expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for
    those awards that vest.

Contingencies

From time to time, we receive notices that our products or
    manufacturing processes allegedly infringe the patent or
    intellectual property rights of others. We periodically assess
    each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be
    recorded in accordance with SFAS 5,

Accounting for
    Contingencies

. In making this determination, we may,
    depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and
    external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the
    information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all
    the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether
    it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and
    whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. If
    a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a
    contingent loss in accordance with SFAS 5. In determining
    the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received
    from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal
    proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior
    case history and other factors. If the judgments and estimates
    made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional
    contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our
    results of operations. See Note 12 in the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for additional information regarding our commitments and
    contingencies.



ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest
    Rate Exposure

Based on our marketable securities and short term investments
    outstanding as of November 1, 2008 and November 3,
    2007, our annual interest income would change by approximately
    $14 million and $9 million, respectively, for each
    100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates. The
    fair values of our investment portfolio at November 1, 2008
    and November 3, 2007 would each change by approximately
    $2 million for each 100 basis point increase or
    decrease in rates.

Foreign
    Currency Exposure

As more fully described in Note 2i. in the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

we regularly hedge our

non-U.S. dollar-based

exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange
    contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching
    the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from
    one month to twelve months. Currently, our largest foreign
    currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European
    operations have the highest proportion of our local currency
    denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures
    existing at November 1, 2008 and November 3, 2007, a
    10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates
    would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash
    flows because we hedge substantially all of our year-end
    exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
    rates.

The market risk associated with our derivative instruments
    results from currency exchange rate or interest rate movements
    that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying
    transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. The
    counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign
    exchange instruments consist of a number of major international
    financial institutions with high credit ratings. We do not
    believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by
    these counterparties because we continually monitor the credit
    ratings of such counterparties, and limit the financial exposure
    with any one financial institution. While the contract or
    notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one
    measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not
    represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. The amounts
    potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible
    inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their
    contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by
    which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts
    exceed our obligations to the counterparties.

The following table illustrates the effect that a 10%
    unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange
    rates, relative to the U.S. dollar, would have on the fair
    value of our forward exchange contracts as of November 1,
    2008 and November 3, 2007:

November 1, 2008

November 3, 2007

Fair value of forward exchange contracts (liability) asset

$

(23,158

)

$

6,924

Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% unfavorable
    movement in foreign currency exchange rates (liability) asset

24,414

Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% favorable
    movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability

$

(9,233

)

The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in
    the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition
    to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes
    typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency
    sales price as competitors’ products become more or less
    attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes
    in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a
    potential change in sales levels or local currency selling
    prices.

    “Company”) is a world leader in the design,
    manufacture and marketing of high-performance analog,
    mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits
    used in industrial, communication, computer and consumer
    applications. Since the Company’s inception in 1965, it has
    focused on solving the engineering challenges associated with
    signal processing in electronic equipment. The Company’s

    generations of digital applications evolve, they require new
    needs for high-performance analog signal processing and digital
    signal processing, or DSP, technology. The Company produces a
    wide range of products that are designed to meet the signal
    processing technology needs of a broad base of customers.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

a.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and all of its subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all
    intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Amounts
    pertaining to the non-controlling ownership interest held by a
    third party in the operating results and financial position of
    the Company’s majority-owned subsidiaries are reported as
    “minority interest.” The Company’s fiscal year is
    the 52-week or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to
    the last day in October. Fiscal year 2008 was a 52-week period,
    fiscal year 2007 was a 53-week period and fiscal 2006 was
    52-week period. Certain amounts reported in previous years have
    been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2008 presentation.
    Such reclassifications were immaterial.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company sold its
    baseband chipset business and related support operations
    (Baseband Chipset Business) to MediaTek Inc. and sold its CPU
    voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to certain
    subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation. The Company has
    reflected the financial results of these businesses as
    discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income
    for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of these
    businesses are reflected as assets and liabilities of
    discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets as of

Cash,
    Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments

Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with
    insignificant interest rate risk and maturities of three months
    or less at the time of acquisition. Cash, cash equivalents and
    short-term investments consist primarily of corporate
    obligations such as commercial paper and corporate bonds and
    institutional money market funds. They also include bank time
    deposits and U.S. Government Treasury bonds.

The Company classifies its investments in readily marketable
    debt and equity securities as “held-to-maturity,”
    “available-for-sale” or “trading” at the
    time of purchase. There were no transfers between investment
    classifications in any of the fiscal years presented.
    Held-to-maturity securities, which are carried at amortized
    cost, include only those securities the Company has the positive
    intent and ability to hold to maturity. Securities, such as bank
    time deposits, which by their nature are typically held to
    maturity, are classified as such. The Company’s other
    readily

marketable cash equivalents and short-term investments are
    classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities
    are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net
    of related tax, reported in accumulated other comprehensive
    (loss) income. The Company’s deferred compensation plan
    investments are classified as trading. See Note 7 for
    additional information on the Company’s deferred
    compensation plan investments. Realized gains and losses, as
    well as interest, and dividends on all securities, are included
    in earnings. No realized gains or losses were recorded during
    any of the fiscal years presented.

The Company periodically evaluates these investments for
    impairment in accordance with EITF Issue

No. 03-01,

The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its
    Application to Certain Investments

. When a decline in fair
    value is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the Company records
    an impairment adjustment in the statement of income. There were
    no other-than-temporary impairments of short-term investments in
    any of the fiscal years presented.

Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out method) or market. The valuation of inventory requires
    the Company to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as
    inventory that is not of saleable quality. The Company employs a
    variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value
    of its inventory. While a portion of the calculation to record
    inventory at its net realizable value is based on the age of the
    inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, a key factor
    in estimating obsolete or excess inventory requires the company
    to estimate the future demand for its products. If actual demand
    is less than the Company’s estimates, impairment charges,
    which are recorded to cost of sales, may need to be recorded in
    future periods. Inventory in excess of saleable amounts is not
    valued, and the remaining inventory is valued at the lower of
    cost or market.

Inventories at November 1, 2008 and November 3, 2007
    were as follows:

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost less
    allowances for depreciation. The straight-line method of
    depreciation is used for all classes of assets for financial
    statement purposes; both straight-line and accelerated methods
    are used for income tax purposes. Leasehold improvements are
    amortized based upon the lesser of the term of the lease or the
    useful life of the asset. Repairs and maintenance charges are
    expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are based on
    the following useful lives:

Buildings & building equipment

Up to 25 years

Machinery & equipment

3-8 years

Office equipment

3-8 years

Depreciation expense from continuing operations of property,
    plant and equipment was $144 million, $139 million and
    $165 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable.
    Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of
    their carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows the
    assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic
    lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
    impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by
    which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value
    determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value
    determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. If
    such assets are not impaired, but their useful lives have
    decreased, the remaining net book value is amortized over the
    revised useful life.

Goodwill
    and Intangible Assets

Goodwill

The Company annually evaluates goodwill for impairment as well
    as whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the
    carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Because the
    Company has one reporting segment under Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (SFAS) 142, the Company utilizes the
    entity-wide approach for assessing goodwill for impairment and
    compares its market value to its net book value to determine if
    an impairment exists. No impairment of goodwill resulted from
    the Company’s most recent evaluation of goodwill for
    impairment, which occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.
    No impairment of goodwill resulted in any of the fiscal years
    presented. The Company’s next annual impairment assessment
    will be made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 unless
    indicators arise that would require the Company to reevaluate at
    an earlier date. The following table presents the changes in
    goodwill during fiscal 2008 and 2007:

Intangible
    Assets

The Company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability
    of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying
    value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected
    to generate over their remaining economic lives. If such assets
    are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized
    in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the
    assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted
    market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a
    discounted cash flow technique.

In connection with the sale of the Baseband Chipset Business to
    MediaTek Inc., net intangible assets of $7.9 million were
    reclassified to assets of discontinued operations in fiscal
    2007. See Note 2u. for additional information on assets of
    discontinued operations and Note 6 for additional

    lives, which range from five to ten years. The intangible assets
    acquired during fiscal 2006 are being amortized over their
    estimated useful lives of two to five years using an accelerated
    method of amortization that is expected to reflect the estimated
    pattern of economic use. The remaining amortization expense will
    be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately
    1.3 years.

Amortization expense from continuing operations, related to
    intangibles was $9.3 million, $9.2 million and
    $3.5 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Grant
    Accounting

Certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries have received
    various grants from governmental agencies. These grants include
    capital, employment and research and development grants. Capital
    grants for the acquisition of property and equipment are netted
    against the related capital expenditures and amortized as a
    credit to depreciation expense over the useful life of the
    related asset. Employment grants, which relate to employee
    hiring and training, and research and development grants are
    recognized in earnings in the period in which the related
    expenditures are incurred by the Company.

Translation
    of Foreign Currencies

The functional currency for the Company’s foreign sales and
    research and development operations is the applicable local
    currency. Gains and losses resulting from translation of these
    foreign currencies into U.S. dollars are recorded in
    accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. Transaction gains
    and losses and remeasurement of foreign currency denominated
    assets and liabilities are included in income currently,
    including those at the Company’s principal foreign
    manufacturing operations where the functional currency is the
    U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses
    included in other expenses, net, were not material in fiscal
    2008, 2007 or 2006.

Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Agreements

The Company enters into forward foreign currency exchange
    contracts to offset certain operational and balance sheet
    exposures from the impact of changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates. Such exposures result from the portion of the
    Company’s operations, assets and liabilities that are
    denominated in currencies other than the



ANALOG
    DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

U.S. dollar, primarily Euro; other exposures include
    Philippine Peso and British Pounds Sterling. These foreign
    currency exchange contracts are entered into to support
    purchases and financing transactions made in the normal course
    of business, and accordingly, are not speculative in nature. In
    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 133 (SFAS 133),

Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities

, hedges related to
    anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the
    inception of the respective hedges as cash flow hedges and are
    evaluated for effectiveness monthly.

The Company records all derivative financial instruments in the
    consolidated financial statements in other current assets or
    accrued liabilities, depending on their net position, at fair
    value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the
    derivative contract. Changes in the fair value of the derivative
    financial instruments are either recognized periodically in
    earnings or in shareholders’ equity as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income (OCI) depending on
    whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge
    accounting as defined by SFAS 133. Changes in fair values
    of derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting are reported
    in earnings as they occur.

Foreign Exchange Exposure Management

— The
    Company has international sales and purchase transactions in
    foreign currencies and has a policy of hedging forecasted and
    actual foreign currency risk with forward foreign currency
    exchange contracts. The Company’s forward foreign currency
    exchange contracts are denominated primarily in Euro and other
    currencies including Philippine Peso and British Pounds
    Sterling. The contracts are for periods consistent with the
    terms of the underlying transactions, generally one year or
    less. Derivative instruments are employed to eliminate or
    minimize certain foreign currency exposures that can be
    confidently identified and quantified. In accordance with
    SFAS 133, hedges related to anticipated transactions are
    designated and documented at the inception of the respective
    hedges as cash flow hedges and are evaluated for effectiveness
    monthly. As the terms of the contract and the underlying
    transaction are matched at inception, forward contract
    effectiveness is calculated by comparing the change in fair
    value of the contract to the change in the forward value of the
    anticipated transaction, with the effective portion of the gain
    or loss on the derivative instrument reported as a component of
    OCI in shareholders’ equity and reclassified into earnings
    in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects
    earnings. Any residual change in fair value of the instruments,
    or ineffectiveness, is recognized immediately in other
    income/expense. Ineffectiveness was immaterial in all fiscal
    years reported.

Additionally, the Company enters into forward foreign currency
    contracts that economically hedge the gains and losses generated
    by the remeasurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities
    in a non-functional currency. Changes in the fair value of these
    undesignated hedges are recognized in other income/expense
    immediately as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the
    asset or liability being hedged.

The market risk associated with the Company’s derivative
    instruments results from currency exchange rate or interest rate
    movements that are expected to offset the market risk of the
    underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged.
    The counterparties to the agreements relating to the
    Company’s foreign exchange instruments consist of a number
    of major international financial institutions with high credit
    ratings. The Company does not believe that there is significant
    risk of nonperformance by these counterparties because the
    Company continually monitors the credit ratings of such
    counterparties, and limits the financial exposure with any one
    financial institution. While the contract or notional amounts of
    derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the
    volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount
    of the Company’s exposure to credit risk. The amounts
    potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible
    inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their
    contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by
    which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts
    exceed the obligations of the Company to the counterparties.

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company

    instruments:

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments

— These investments, except for those
    classified as held-to-maturity, which are carried at amortized
    cost, are adjusted to fair value based on quoted market prices
    or are determined using a yield curve model based on current
    market rates.

Deferred compensation plan investments and other
    investments

— The fair value of these
    investments is based on quoted market prices, with the exception
    of private-company equity investments that are carried at cost,
    adjusted for impairment charges.

Forward foreign currency exchange contracts

— The estimated fair value of forward foreign
    currency exchange contracts, which includes derivatives that are
    accounted for as cash flow hedges and those that are not
    designated as cash flow hedges, is based on the estimated amount
    at which they could be settled based on forward market exchange
    rates.

k.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial
    statements and the reported amounts of



ANALOG
    DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates
    relate to the useful lives of fixed assets and identified
    intangible assets, allowances for doubtful accounts and customer
    returns, the net realizable value of inventory, potential
    reserves relating to litigation matters, accrued liabilities,
    accrued taxes, deferred tax valuation allowances, assumptions
    pertaining to share-based payments and other reserves. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates, and such differences
    may be material to the financial statements.

l.

Concentrations
    of Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
    concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments
    and trade accounts receivable.

The Company maintains cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments and long-term investments with high credit quality
    financial institutions and monitors the amount of credit
    exposure to any one financial institution and issuer.

The Company sells its products to distributors and original
    equipment manufacturers involved in a variety of industries
    including industrial process automation, instrumentation,
    defense/aerospace, automotive, communications, computers and
    computer peripherals and consumer electronics. The Company has
    adopted credit policies and standards to accommodate growth in
    these markets. The Company performs continuing credit
    evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and
    although the Company generally does not require collateral, the
    Company may require letters of credit from customers in certain
    circumstances. The Company provides reserves for estimated
    amounts of accounts receivable that may not be collected.

m.

Concentration
    of Other Risks

The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid
    technological change, competitive pricing pressures and cyclical
    market patterns. The Company’s financial results are
    affected by a wide variety of factors, including general
    economic conditions worldwide, economic conditions specific to
    the semiconductor industry, the timely implementation of new
    manufacturing technologies, the ability to safeguard patents and
    intellectual property in a rapidly evolving market and reliance
    on assembly and test subcontractors, third-party wafer
    fabricators and independent distributors. In addition, the
    semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject
    to significant economic downturns at various times. The Company
    is exposed to the risk of obsolescence of its inventory
    depending on the mix of future business. Additionally, a large
    portion of the Company’s external wafer purchase and
    foundry services are from a limited number of suppliers,
    primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). If
    TSMC or any of the Company’s other key suppliers are unable
    or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of
    components, on the time schedule and of the quality that the
    Company requires, the Company may be forced to engage additional
    or replacement suppliers, which could result in significant
    expenses and disruptions or delays in manufacturing, product
    development and shipment of product to the Company’s
    customers. Although the Company has experienced shortages of
    components, materials and external foundry services from time to
    time, these items have generally been available to the Company
    as needed.

n.

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue from product sales to customers is generally recognized
    when title passes, which for shipments to certain foreign
    countries is subsequent to product shipment. Title for these
    shipments ordinarily passes within a week of shipment. A reserve
    for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based
    on historical experience or specific identification of an event
    necessitating a reserve.

In all regions of the world, the Company defers revenue and the
    related cost of sales on shipments to distributors until the
    distributors resell the products to their customers. Therefore,
    the Company’s product revenue fully reflects end customer
    purchases and is not impacted by distributor inventory levels.
    Sales to distributors are made under agreements that allow
    distributors to receive price adjustment credits, as discussed
    below, and to return



ANALOG
    DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

qualifying products for credit, as determined by the Company, in
    order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or
    obsolete product from their inventory. These agreements limit
    such returns to a certain percentage of the value of the
    Company’s shipments to that distributor during the prior
    quarter. In addition, distributors are allowed to return unsold
    products if the Company terminates the relationship with the
    distributor.

Distributors are granted price-adjustment credits related to
    many of their sales to their customers. Price adjustment credits
    are granted when the distributor’s standard cost (i.e., the
    Company’s sales price to the distributor) does not provide
    the distributor with an appropriate margin on its sales to its
    customers. As distributors negotiate selling prices with their
    customers, the final sales price agreed to with the customer
    will be influenced by many factors, including the particular
    product being sold, the quantity ordered, the particular
    customer, the geographic location of the distributor, and the
    competitive landscape. As a result, the distributor may request
    and receive a price adjustment credit from the Company to allow
    the distributor to earn an appropriate margin on the transaction.

Distributors are also granted price adjustment credits in the
    event of a price decrease subsequent to the date the product was
    shipped and billed to the distributor. Generally, the Company
    will provide a credit equal to the difference between the price
    paid by the distributor (less any prior credits on such
    products) and the new price for the product multiplied by the
    quantity of such product in the distributor’s inventory at
    the time of the price decrease.

Given the uncertainties associated with the levels of price
    adjustment credits to be granted to distributors, the sales
    price to the distributor is not fixed or determinable until the
    distributor resells the products to their customers. Therefore,
    the Company defers revenue recognition from sales to
    distributors until the distributors have sold the products to
    their customers.

Title to the inventory transfers to the distributor at the time
    of shipment or delivery to the distributor, and payment from the
    distributor is due in accordance with the Company’s
    standard payment terms. These payment terms are not contingent
    upon the distributors’ sale of the products to their
    customers. Upon title transfer to distributors, inventory is
    reduced for the cost of goods shipped, the margin (sales less
    cost of sales) is recorded as “deferred income on shipments
    to distributors, net” and an account receivable is recorded.

The deferred costs of sales to distributors have historically
    had very little risk of impairment due to the margins the
    Company earns on sales of its products and the relatively long
    life-cycle of the Company’s products. Product returns from
    distributors that are ultimately scrapped have historically been
    immaterial. In addition, price protection and price adjustment
    credits granted to distributors historically have not exceeded
    the margins the Company earns on sales of its products. The
    Company continuously monitors the level and nature of product
    returns and is in continuous contact with the distributors to
    ensure reserves are established for all known material issues.

As of November 1, 2008 and November 3, 2007, the
    Company had gross deferred revenue of $279.3 million and
    $250.6 million, respectively, and gross deferred cost of
    sales of $103.9 million and $99.2 million,
    respectively. Deferred income on shipments to distributors
    increased by $23.9 million in fiscal 2008 as a result of
    the Company’s shipments to its distributors in fiscal 2008
    exceeding the distributors’ sales to their customers during
    this same time period.

Shipping costs are charged to cost of sales as incurred.

The Company generally offers a

12-month

warranty for its products. The Company’s warranty policy
    provides for replacement of the defective product. Specific
    accruals are recorded for known product warranty issues. Product
    warranty expenses during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 were not
    material.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company recorded
    revenue of $35 million received in exchange for licensing
    of certain intellectual property rights to a third party.

Income
    Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
    differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets
    and liabilities and are measured using the enacted income tax
    rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the
    temporary differences are expected to reverse. Additionally,
    deferred tax assets and liabilities are separated into current
    and noncurrent amounts based on the classification of the
    related assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes.

Earnings
    Per Share of Common Stock

Basic earnings per share is computed based only on the weighted
    average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
    Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted
    average number of common shares outstanding during the period,
    plus the dilutive effect of potential future issuances of common
    stock relating to stock option programs and other potentially
    dilutive securities using the treasury stock method. In
    calculating diluted earnings per share, the dilutive effect of
    stock options is computed using the average market price for the
    respective period. In addition, under Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(SFAS 123R), the assumed
    proceeds under the treasury stock method include the average
    unrecognized compensation expense of stock options that are
    in-the-money. This results in the “assumed” buyback of
    additional shares, thereby reducing the dilutive impact of stock
    options. Potential shares related to certain of the
    Company’s outstanding stock options were excluded because
    they were anti-dilutive. Those potential shares, determined
    based on the weighted average exercise prices during the
    respective years, related to the Company’s outstanding
    stock options could be dilutive in the future.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(SFAS 123R). SFAS 123R supersedes APB Opinion
    No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

,
    and amends SFAS No. 95,

Statement of Cash
    Flows

. Generally, the approach in SFAS 123R is similar
    to the approach described in SFAS 123

Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation

. However, SFAS 123R requires
    all share-based payments to employees, including grants of
    employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement
    over their vesting period based on their fair values at the date
    of grant. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative.

On October 30, 2005 (the first day of its 2006 fiscal
    year), the Company adopted SFAS 123R using the modified
    prospective method as permitted under SFAS 123R. Under this
    transition method, compensation cost recognized in the
    statements of income includes: (a) compensation cost for
    all share-based payments granted prior to but not yet vested as
    of October 29, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value
    estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123,
    and (b) compensation cost for all share-based payments
    granted subsequent to October 29, 2005, based on the
    grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS 123R.

    stock-based compensation.

Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities — an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 133

(SFAS 161). SFAS 161 changes the
    disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging
    activities. SFAS 161 requires entities to provide enhanced
    disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative
    instruments; how derivative instruments and related hedged items
    are accounted for under SFAS 133 and its related
    interpretations; and how derivative instruments and related
    hedged items affect an entity’s financial position,
    financial performance and cash flows. This statement is
    effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and
    interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. The
    Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, that
    SFAS 161 may have on the Company’s financial
    condition and results of operations. The adoption of
    SFAS 161 will change the Company’s disclosures for
    derivative instruments and hedging activities beginning in the
    second quarter of fiscal year 2009.

Business
    Combinations

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007),

Business Combinations

(SFAS 141R).
    SFAS 141R requires an acquiring entity in a business
    combination to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities
    assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their
    fair value on the acquisition date. It further requires that
    acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs be recognized
    separately from the acquisition. SFAS 141R is effective for
    fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, which is
    the Company’s fiscal year 2010. The Company is currently
    evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 141R may have on
    the Company’s financial condition and results of
    operations. The adoption of SFAS 141R will change the
    Company’s accounting treatment for business combinations on
    a prospective basis beginning in the first quarter of fiscal
    year 2010.

Noncontrolling
    Interests

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements

(SFAS 160). SFAS 160 clarifies that a
    noncontrolling or minority interest in a subsidiary is
    considered an ownership interest and, accordingly, requires all
    entities to report such interests in subsidiaries as equity in
    the consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008, which is the Company’s fiscal year 2010. The Company
    is currently evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 160
    may have on the Company’s financial condition and results
    of operations.

Accounting
    for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115

(SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits entities
    to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain
    other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial
    reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate
    volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related
    assets and liabilities differently without having to apply
    complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective
    for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, which
    is the Company’s fiscal year 2009. The Company is currently
    evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 159 may have on
    the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.

Fair
    Value Measurements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(SFAS 157). SFAS 157
    provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure
    assets and liabilities. The standard also provides for expanded
    information about the extent to which companies measure assets
    and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure
    fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on
    earnings. SFAS 157 applies

whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities
    to be measured at fair value. This standard does not expand the
    use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS 157 is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2007, which is the Company’s fiscal year 2009. The adoption
    of SFAS 157 in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 will not
    materially impact the Company’s financial condition and
    results of operations. The adoption of SFAS 157 will expand
    the Company’s disclosures pertaining to the measurement of
    assets and liabilities beginning in the first quarter of fiscal
    year 2009.

Discontinued
    Operations

In November 2007, the Company entered into a purchase and sale
    agreement with certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor
    Corporation to sell the Company’s CPU voltage regulation
    and PC thermal monitoring business which consists of core
    voltage regulator products for the central processing unit in
    computing and gaming applications and temperature sensors and
    fan-speed controllers for managing the temperature of the
    central processing unit. During the first quarter of fiscal
    2008, the Company completed the sale of this business for net
    cash proceeds of $138 million, which was net of other cash
    payments of approximately $1.4 million. The Company made
    final additional cash payments of approximately
    $2.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. In
    connection with the purchase and sale agreement,
    $7.5 million was placed into escrow and was excluded from
    the gain calculations. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain in
    the first quarter of fiscal 2008 of $78 million, or
    $43 million net of tax, which was recorded as a gain on
    sale of discontinued operations. During the third quarter of
    fiscal 2008, additional proceeds were released from escrow and
    an additional pre-tax gain of $6.6 million, or
    $3.8 million net of tax, was recorded as a gain on sale of
    discontinued operations. Additionally, at the time of the sale,
    the Company entered into a one-year manufacturing supply
    agreement with a subsidiary of ON Semiconductor Corporation for
    an additional $37 million. The Company has allocated the
    proceeds from this arrangement based on the fair value of the
    two elements of this transaction: 1) the sale of a business
    and 2) the obligation to manufacture product for a one-year
    period. As a result, $85 million was recorded as a
    liability related to the manufacturing supply agreement, of
    which approximately $10.3 million remained as a liability
    as of November 1, 2008. The liability is included in
    current liabilities of discontinued operations on the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The Company is
    recording the revenue associated with this manufacturing supply
    agreement in discontinued operations. As a result, the Company
    has classified inventory for this arrangement as a current asset
    of discontinued operations. The Company may receive additional
    proceeds of up to $1 million, currently held in escrow,
    upon the resolution of certain contingent items, which would be
    recorded as additional gain from the sale of discontinued
    operations.

In September 2007, the Company entered into a definitive
    agreement to sell its Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc.
    The decision to sell the Baseband Chipset Business was due to
    the Company’s decision to focus its resources in areas
    where its signal processing expertise can provide unique
    capabilities and earn superior returns. On January 11,
    2008, the Company completed the sale of its Baseband Chipset
    Business for net cash proceeds of $269 million. The cash
    proceeds received were net of a refundable withholding tax of
    $62 million and other cash payments of approximately
    $9 million. The Company made additional cash payments of
    $7.8 million during fiscal 2008, primarily related to
    transaction fees and retention payments to employees that
    transferred to MediaTek Inc. The Company expects to make
    additional cash payments of approximately $2.5 million,
    related to retention payments to employees that transferred to
    MediaTek Inc. and intellectual property license fees incurred by
    MediaTek Inc. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain in fiscal 2008
    of $278 million, or $202 million net of tax, which is
    recorded as a gain on sale of discontinued operations. The
    Company may receive additional proceeds of up to
    $10 million, currently held in escrow, upon the resolution
    of certain contingent items, which would be recorded as
    additional gain from the sale of discontinued operations.

During fiscal 2008, the Company made income tax payments of
    $110.4 million related to the gain on the sale of these
    businesses. These tax payments are reflected in the statement of
    cash flows as a decrease in net cash provided by operating
    activities. Under SFAS No. 95,

Statement of Cash
    Flows

, all income tax payments are included in determining
    net cash flow from operating activities but the cash received
    from the sale of the businesses must be reported as an investing
    cash flow.

    these dispositions over the next two quarters. The transition
    service agreements include manufacturing, engineering support
    and certain human resource services and information technology
    systems support. The Company has evaluated the nature of the
    transition services and has concluded the services will be
    primarily completed within the one-year assessment period, and
    the Company does not have the ability to exert significant
    influence over the disposed businesses’ operating and

Equity
    Compensation Plans

The Company grants, or has granted, stock options and other
    stock and stock-based awards under the following equity
    compensation plans:

2006 Stock Incentive Plan (2006 Plan)

— The
    2006 Plan was approved by the Company’s Board of Directors
    on January 23, 2006 and was approved by shareholders on
    March 14, 2006 and subsequently amended in March 2006. The
    2006 Plan provides for the grant of up to 15 million shares
    of the Company’s common stock, plus such number of
    additional shares that were subject to outstanding options under
    the Company’s 1998 Stock Option Plan and the 2001
    Broad-Based Stock Option Plan as of January 23, 2006 that
    are not issued because the applicable option award subsequently
    terminates or expires without being exercised. The 2006 Plan
    provides for the grant of incentive stock options intended to
    qualify under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of
    1986, as amended, non-statutory stock options, stock
    appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units
    and other stock-based awards. Employees, officers, directors,
    consultants and advisors of the Company and its subsidiaries are
    eligible to be granted awards under the 2006 Plan. No award may
    be made under the 2006 Plan after March 13, 2016, but
    awards previously granted may extend beyond that date. The
    Company will not grant further options under the 1998 Plan or
    the 2001 Plan.

2001 Broad-Based Stock Option Plan (2001
    Plan)

— The 2001 Plan was adopted by the
    Company’s Board of Directors in December 2001 and
    subsequently amended in December 2002. The 2001 Plan provides
    for the issuance of options to purchase up to 50 million
    shares of common stock to employees, consultants or advisors of
    the Company and its subsidiaries, other than executive officers
    and directors. Following the approval of the 2006 Plan, no
    further grants have or will be made under the 2001 Plan.

The 1998 Stock Option Plan (1998 Plan)

— The
    1998 Plan was approved by shareholders in fiscal 1998 and
    subsequently amended in December 2001 and December 2002. The
    1998 Plan provides for the issuance of nonstatutory and
    incentive stock options to purchase up to 30 million shares
    of common stock. In March 2000, the Company’s shareholders
    approved an amendment to the 1998 Plan to increase the shares
    reserved for issuance under the 1998 Plan by an additional
    34 million shares. Following the approval of the 2006 Plan,
    no further grants have or will be made under the 1998 Plan.

While the Company may grant to employees options that become
    exercisable at different times or within different periods, the
    Company has generally granted to employees options that vest
    over five years and become exercisable in annual installments of
    20% on each of the first, second, third, fourth and fifth
    anniversaries of the date of grant;


/

    on each of the third, fourth, and fifth anniversaries of the
    date of grant; or in annual installments of 25% on each of the
    second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of
    grant. The maximum contractual term of all options is ten years.

Expected volatility — The Company is responsible for
    estimating volatility and has considered a number of factors,
    including third-party estimates, when estimating volatility. The
    Company currently believes that the exclusive use of implied
    volatility results in the best estimate of the grant-date fair
    value of employee stock options because it reflects the
    market’s current expectations of future volatility. In
    evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied
    volatility, the Company concluded that: (1) options in the
    Company’s common stock are actively traded with sufficient
    volume on several exchanges; (2) the market prices of both
    the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a
    similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the
    grant date of the employee share options; (3) the traded
    options have exercise prices that are both near-the-money and
    close to the exercise price of the employee share options; and
    (4) the maturities of the traded options used to estimate
    volatility are at least one year.

Expected term — The Company uses historical employee
    exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected
    term assumption for the Black-Scholes grant-date valuation. The
    Company believes that this historical data is currently the best
    estimate of the expected term of a new option, and that
    generally its employees exhibit similar exercise behavior.

Risk-free interest rate — The yield on zero-coupon
    U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate
    with the expected term assumption is used as the risk-free
    interest rate.

Expected dividend yield — Expected dividend yield is
    calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by the
    Company’s Board of Directors for the current quarter and
    dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of
    grant. Until such time as the Company’s Board of Directors
    declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from
    the current quarter’s cash dividend, the current dividend
    will be used in deriving this assumption. Cash dividends are not
    paid on options, restricted stock or restricted stock units.

Stock-based
    Compensation Expense

The Company used the graded attribution method to recognize
    expense for all stock-based awards prior to the adoption of
    SFAS 123R. Upon adoption of SFAS 123R on
    October 30, 2005, the Company changed to the straight-line
    attribution method to recognize expense for stock-based awards
    granted after October 29, 2005. The change to the
    straight-line attribution method was made so that the expense
    associated with each stock-based award is recognized ratably
    over the vesting period. The expense associated with the
    unvested portion of the pre-adoption grants will continue to be
    expensed using the graded attribution method.

The amount of stock-based compensation recognized during a
    period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that
    are ultimately expected to vest. SFAS 123R requires
    forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if
    necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ
    from those estimates. The term “forfeitures” is



ANALOG
    DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

distinct from “cancellations” or
    “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion
    of the surrendered stock-based award. Based on an analysis of
    its historical forfeitures, the Company has applied an annual
    forfeiture rate of 4.3% to all unvested stock-based awards as of
    November 1, 2008. The rate of 4.3% represents the portion
    that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting
    period. This analysis will be re-evaluated quarterly and the
    forfeiture rate will be adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the
    actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be
    for those shares that vest.

The Company’s stock option agreements historically provided
    for retirement-related continued vesting for a portion, or all,
    of certain stock options based on the optionee’s age and
    years of service (the retirement provision) in that regardless
    of whether the employee continues to provide services, the
    optionee receives the benefit of the stock option.
    SFAS 123R clarifies the timing for recognizing stock-based
    compensation expense for awards subject to continued vesting
    upon meeting this retirement provision. This compensation
    expense must be recognized over the period from the date of
    grant to the date retirement eligibility is met if it is shorter
    than the requisite service period. Upon adoption of
    SFAS 123R in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company
    changed its policy regarding the timing of option expense
    recognition for optionees meeting the criteria of the retirement
    provision to recognize compensation cost over the period through
    the date that the optionee is no longer required to provide
    service to earn the award. Prior to the adoption of
    SFAS 123R, the Company’s policy was to recognize these
    compensation costs over the vesting term. Effective during the
    third fiscal quarter of fiscal 2006, new grants do not include a
    provision that provides for retirement-related continued vesting.

In addition to the vested options, the Company expects a portion
    of the unvested options to vest at some point in the future.
    Options expected to vest is calculated by applying an estimated
    forfeiture rate to the unvested options.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised (i.e. the
    difference between the market price at exercise and the price
    paid by the employee to exercise the options) during fiscal 2008
    was $121.7 million and the total amount of cash received by
    the Company from exercise of these options was
    $100.6 million. Proceeds from stock option exercises
    pursuant to employee stock plans in the Company’s statement
    of cash flows of $94.2 million is net of the value of
    shares surrendered by employees to satisfy employee tax
    obligations upon vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock
    units and in connection with the exercise of stock options
    granted to the Company’s employees under the Company’s
    equity compensation plans. The withholding amount is based on
    the Company’s minimum

    The total grant-date fair value of stock options that vested
    during fiscal 2008 was approximately $77.6 million.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised (i.e. the
    difference between the market price at exercise and the price
    paid by the employee to exercise the options) during fiscal 2007
    was $152.6 million and the total amount of cash received by
    the Company from exercise of these options was
    $109.1 million. The total grant-date fair value of stock
    options that vested during fiscal 2007 was approximately
    $72.8 million.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised (i.e. the
    difference between the market price at exercise and the price
    paid by the employee to exercise the options) during fiscal 2006
    was $113.6 million and the total amount of cash received by
    the Company from exercise of these options was
    $82.4 million. The total grant-date fair value of stock
    options that vested during fiscal 2006 was approximately
    $145.5 million.

The 2006 Plan provides that for purposes of determining the
    number of shares available for issuance under the 2006 Plan, any
    restricted stock award, restricted stock unit or other
    stock-based award with a per share or per unit price lower than
    the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant
    (a “Full-Value Award”) will be counted as three shares
    for each share subject to the Full-Value Award.

As of November 1, 2008, a total of 87,590,148 common shares
    were reserved for issuance under the Company’s stock option
    plans.

Common
    Stock Repurchase Program

The Company’s common stock repurchase program has been in
    place since August 2004. In the aggregate, the Board of
    Directors has authorized the Company to repurchase
    $4 billion of the Company’s common stock under the
    program. Under the program, the Company may repurchase
    outstanding shares of its common stock from time to time in the
    open market and through privately negotiated transactions.
    Unless terminated earlier by resolution of the Company’s
    Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when the
    Company has repurchased all shares authorized under the program.
    The Company repurchased approximately 19.4 million shares
    for approximately $569.9 million during fiscal 2008. As of
    November 1, 2008, the Company had repurchased a total of
    approximately 114.5 million shares of its common stock for
    approximately $3,904.7 million under this program and an
    additional $95.4 million remains under the current
    authorized program. The repurchased shares are held as
    authorized but unissued shares of common stock. The Company also
    from time to time repurchases shares in settlement of employee
    tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted
    stock or restricted stock units, or the exercise of stock
    options. Any future common stock repurchases will be dependent
    upon the amount of cash available to the Company in the United
    States.

Preferred
    Stock

The Company has 471,934 authorized shares of $1.00 par
    value preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding.
    The Board of Directors is authorized to fix designations,
    relative rights, preferences and limitations on the preferred
    stock at the time of issuance.

Common
    Stock Purchase Rights

In March 1998, the Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder
    Rights Plan (the Stockholder Rights Plan) that replaced a plan
    adopted by the Board in 1988. Pursuant to the Stockholder Rights
    Plan, after giving effect to the Company’s two-for-one
    stock split effected on March 15, 2000, each share of the
    Company’s common stock had an associated one-half of a
    right. Under certain circumstances, each whole right would have
    entitled the registered holder to purchase from the Company one
    one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating
    Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $180 in cash, subject to
    adjustment.

On January 23, 2006, the Company, by vote of its Board of
    Directors, terminated its Stockholder Rights Plan. All rights
    outstanding under the Stockholder Rights Plan were redeemed at a
    redemption price of $0.0005 per right (as adjusted to reflect
    the two-for-one split of the Company’s common stock on
    March 15, 2000) (as adjusted, the Redemption Price)
    and paid on March 15, 2006 to the holders of record of the
    Company’s common stock on February 24, 2006. All
    rights to exercise rights issued under the Stockholder Rights
    Plan terminated on January 23, 2006 and the only right
    thereafter of the holders of rights issued under the Stockholder
    Rights Plan was to receive the Redemption Price.

Revenue
    Trends by End Market

The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using
    a variety of data points including the technical characteristics
    of the product, the “sold to” customer information,
    the “ship to” customer information and the end
    customer product or application into which the Company’s
    product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and
    tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of
    products by end market can vary over

Revenue
    Trends by Product

The following table summarizes revenue by product categories.
    The categorization of the Company’s products into broad
    categories is based on the characteristics of the individual
    products, the specification of the products and in some cases
    the specific uses that certain products have within
    applications. The categorization of products into categories is
    therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over
    time. In instances where products move between product
    categories the Company reclassifies the amounts in the product
    categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications
    typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the
    underlying trends of results within, each product category.

Special
    Charges

Closure
    of Wafer Fabrication Facility in Sunnyvale

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company recorded a
    special charge of $20.3 million as a result of its decision
    to close its California wafer fabrication operations and
    transfer virtually all of the production of products
    manufactured there to its facility in Wilmington, Massachusetts.
    The charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs that the
    Company recorded pursuant to SFAS 88,

Employers’
    Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit
    Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits

, or SFAS 88,
    under the Company’s ongoing benefit plan for 339
    manufacturing employees and 28 general and administrative
    employees. The severance benefit is based on the length of past
    service, and employees had to continue to be employed until
    their employment was involuntarily terminated in order to
    receive the severance benefit. The Company completed the final
    cleanup and closure activities associated with this action
    during the second quarter of fiscal 2007.

In addition the Company recorded additional expense during
    fiscal 2006 related to the Sunnyvale facility closure, that
    consisted of $18.3 million of non-cash cost of sales
    expenses for additional depreciation due to shortened useful
    lives of certain manufacturing equipment and $2.0 million
    for stay-on bonuses for certain employees critical to
    facilitating the closure of this facility. The Company reversed
    approximately $2.0 million of the severance accrual during
    fiscal 2006 because some employees voluntarily left the Company
    and other employees found alternative employment within the
    Company. In addition, there was an over-accrual related to
    fringe benefits because severance payments, normally paid as
    income continuance, were paid in lump sum payments, which
    reduced the benefit costs associated with these payments. The
    Company has terminated the employment of all of the employees
    included in this action.

The Company ceased production at the wafer fabrication facility
    on November 9, 2006. During the first quarter of fiscal
    2007, the Company recorded additional expense, in accordance
    with SFAS 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit
    or Disposal Activities

or, SFAS 146, which consisted of
    $3.2 million for

clean-up

and
    closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred and
    $0.4 million for lease obligation costs for a warehouse
    facility the Company ceased using during the first quarter of
    fiscal 2007. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the
    Company recorded a special charge, in accordance with
    SFAS 146, which included $5.0 million of expense for
    future lease obligation costs for the wafer fabrication facility
    that the Company ceased using during the second quarter of
    fiscal 2007. The lease obligation costs are being paid out on a
    monthly basis over the remaining lease term, which expires in
    2010. Also included in this special charge was $1.7 million
    for facility

clean-up

and
    closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred. The
    Company completed the

clean-up

activity during the second quarter of fiscal 2007, and does not
    expect to incur any additional charges related to this action.

Reorganization
    of Product Development and Support Programs

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company recorded a
    special charge of $11.2 million as a result of its decision
    to reorganize its product development and support programs with
    the goal of providing greater focus on its analog and digital
    signal processing product programs. The charge was for severance
    and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under
    the Company’s ongoing benefit plan or statutory
    requirements at foreign locations for 60 manufacturing employees
    and 154 engineering and selling, marketing, general and
    administrative employees associated with these programs.

During fiscal 2006, the Company recorded an additional special
    charge of $3.8 million related to this reorganization
    action. Approximately $1.5 million of this charge was for
    lease obligation costs for a facility that the Company ceased
    using during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and the write-off
    of property, plant and equipment and other items at this
    facility. The remaining $2.3 million related to the
    severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2006 pursuant to SFAS 88 under the
    Company’s ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at
    foreign locations for 46 engineering and selling, marketing,
    general and administrative employees associated with these
    programs.



ANALOG
    DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company recorded an
    additional special charge of $1.6 million related to this
    reorganization action. Approximately $0.6 million of this
    charge was for contract termination costs. The remaining
    $1.0 million relates to severance and fringe benefit costs
    recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under the Company’s
    ongoing benefit plan for six engineering employees associated
    with these programs. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007,
    the Company recorded an additional special charge of
    $3.4 million related to this reorganization action.
    Approximately $3.2 million related to the severance and
    fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under the
    Company’s ongoing benefit plan or minimum statutory
    requirements at foreign locations for 20 engineering and
    selling, marketing, general and administrative employees. The
    remaining $0.2 million of this charge was for lease
    obligation costs for a facility that the Company ceased using
    during the second quarter of fiscal 2007. During the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company reversed approximately
    $0.9 million of its severance accrual because some
    employees voluntarily left the Company and other employees found
    alternative employment within the Company, and were therefore no
    longer entitled to severance payments.

The employment of all employees associated with these programs
    has been terminated and amounts owed to employees for severance
    are being paid out as income continuance. The Company does not
    expect to incur any further charges related to this
    reorganization action.

Fourth
    Quarter of Fiscal 2007 Special Charges

Consolidation
    of a Wafer Fabrication Facility in Limerick

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company recorded a
    special charge of $13.7 million as a result of its decision
    to only use eight-inch technology at its wafer fabrication
    facility in Limerick. Certain manufacturing processes and
    products produced on the Limerick facility’s six-inch
    production line will transition to the Company’s existing
    eight-inch production line in Limerick while others will
    transition to external foundries. The charge is for severance
    and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under
    the Company’s ongoing benefit plan for 150 manufacturing
    employees associated with this action. As of November 1,
    2008, 126 of the 150 employees included in this cost
    reduction action were still employed by the Company. The Company
    expects production to cease in the six-inch wafer fabrication
    facility during the first half of 2009, at which time the
    employment of the remaining affected employees will be
    terminated. These employees must continue to be employed by the
    Company until their employment is involuntarily terminated in
    order to receive the severance benefit. During the fourth
    quarter of 2008, the Company recorded an additional charge of
    $1.5 million related to this action, of which
    $1.2 million was an adjustment to the original estimate of
    the severance costs and $0.3 million was for

clean-up

and
    closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred. The
    Company expects to incur additional

clean-up

and
    closure costs related to this action over the next three
    quarters totaling approximately $1.5 million. In accordance
    with SFAS 146, the Company will expense these costs as
    incurred.

Reduction
    of Overhead Infrastructure Costs

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company decided to
    either deemphasize or exit certain businesses or products and
    focus investments in products and end markets where it has
    better opportunities for profitable growth. In September 2007,
    the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its
    Baseband Chipset Business. As a result, the Company decided to
    reduce the support infrastructure in manufacturing, engineering
    and SMG&A to more appropriately reflect its required
    overhead structure. Consequently, during the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2007, the Company recorded a special charge of
    $12.3 million, of which $10.7 million was for
    severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to
    SFAS 88 under the Company’s ongoing benefit plan or
    statutory requirements at foreign locations for 25 manufacturing
    employees and 127 engineering and selling, marketing, general
    and administrative employees associated with this action. The
    remaining $1.6 million was for contract termination costs
    related to a license agreement associated with products the
    Company will no longer develop and for which there is no future
    alternative use. As of November 1, 2008, 6 of the
    152 employees included in this cost reduction action



ANALOG
    DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

were still employed by the Company. These employees must
    continue to be employed by the Company until their employment is
    involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance
    benefit.

Fourth
    Quarter of 2008 Special Charge

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company decided to
    further reduce its operating cost structure. Consequently,
    during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company recorded a
    special charge of $1.6 million for severance and fringe
    benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under its
    ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign
    locations for 19 engineering and SMG&A employees. As of
    November 1, 2008 14 of the 19 employees included in
    this cost reduction action were still employed by the Company.
    These employees must continue to be employed by the Company
    until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to
    receive the severance benefit.

6.

Acquisitions

In fiscal 2006, the Company completed a transaction with TTPCom
    Limited (TTPCom), whereby TTPCom transferred to the Company
    intellectual property, engineering resources, and related assets
    associated with the support and customization of TTPCom’s
    GSM/GPRS/EDGE modem software for use on the Company’s
    existing and future generations of
    SoftFone

®

baseband processors. The Company also acquired development
    rights for AJAR, TTPCom’s advanced applications platform.
    As a result of this transaction, the Company became the single
    point of contact for both hardware and software support for its
    new and existing wireless handset customers, thus improving the
    Company’s abilities to service the needs of individual
    customers. The Company paid TTPCom $11.9 million in initial
    cash payments. The Company allocated the purchase price to the
    tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated
    fair values at the date of acquisition. The estimated fair
    values of the assets exceeded the initial payments by
    $7.8 million, resulting in negative goodwill. Pursuant to
    SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations

, the
    Company recorded a liability for the contingent consideration
    that was accounted for as additional purchase price, up to the
    amount of the negative goodwill. As contingent payments became
    due, the Company applied the payments against the contingent
    liability. As of October 28, 2006, the Company had paid
    $6 million of contingent payments and the remaining
    contingent liability was $1.8 million. The purchase price
    included $5.5 million of in-process technology that had not
    yet reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future
    use and was charged to operations during fiscal 2006. The
    in-process technology related to software code developed for use
    in the Company’s semiconductor chipsets manufactured for
    devices that use both the 2G and 2.5G cellular wireless
    technology standards. The Company determined the fair value of
    the in-process technology with the assistance of a third party
    using the income approach. At the time of the acquisition, the
    in-process technology was approximately 56% complete. The
    Company completed the in-process research and development
    projects during fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2007, the Company
    paid an additional $6.1 million of contingent
    consideration, which resulted in reducing the $1.8 million
    liability and recording additional goodwill of
    $4.3 million. All technological milestones have been met
    and no additional payments will be made. The acquisition also
    included $13.2 million of intangible assets that the
    Company was amortizing over their estimated useful lives of five
    years using an accelerated amortization method that reflects the
    estimated pattern of economic use. As a result of the sale of
    the Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc., the Company
    reclassified $7.9 million of net intangible assets to
    assets of discontinued operations at November 3, 2007 and
    transferred them to MediaTek Inc. during the first quarter of
    fiscal 2008. See Note 2u. for additional information on
    assets of discontinued operations.

In fiscal 2006, the Company acquired substantially all the
    outstanding stock of privately-held Integrant Technologies, Inc.
    (Integrant) of Seoul, Korea. The acquisition enabled the Company
    to enter the mobile TV market and strengthened its presence in
    the Asian region. The Company paid $127.2 million in
    initial cash payments at closing and were obligated to make
    additional cash payments of up to an aggregate of
    $33 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions.
    The initial cash payments included $4.2 million held in
    escrow for the purchase of the remaining non-founder outstanding
    shares. The Company purchased these shares during fiscal 2007
    and recorded them as additional goodwill. The Company allocated
    the purchase price to the tangible and intangible



ANALOG
    DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date
    of acquisition. The Company completed the final purchase
    accounting for this transaction during fiscal 2007, which
    resulted in an additional $5.6 million of goodwill. The
    $33 million of potential cash payments is comprised of
    $25 million for the achievement of revenue-based milestones
    during the period from July 2006 through December 2007, none of
    which were met, and $8.4 million related to the purchase of
    shares from the founder of Integrant during the period from July
    2007 through July 2009. The Company recorded or will record
    these payments as additional purchase price . The Company has
    paid $6.3 million to repurchase founder shares through
    November 1, 2008 and will make the remaining
    $2.1 million payment during fiscal 2009. The purchase price
    included $11.1 million of in-process technology that had
    not yet reached technological feasibility, had no alternative
    future use and was charged to operations during the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2006. The in-process technology related to
    technologies currently in development for Dual DAB,

T-DMB,

DVB-H, RFID and WiBro applications. The Company
    determined the fair value of the in-process technology with the
    assistance of a third party using the income forecast approach.
    At the time of the acquisition, the in-process technology was
    approximately 74% complete. The Company completed the in-process
    research and development projects during fiscal 2007. The
    acquisition also included $21.6 million of intangible
    assets that the Company is amortizing over their estimated
    useful lives of two to five years using an accelerated
    amortization method that reflects the estimated pattern of
    economic use.

In fiscal 2006, the Company acquired all the outstanding stock
    of privately-held AudioAsics A/S (AudioAsics) of Roskilde,
    Denmark. The acquisition of AudioAsics allows the Company to
    continue developing low-power audio solutions, while expanding
    its presence in the Nordic and Eastern European regions. The
    Company paid $19.3 million in initial cash payments at
    closing and may be obligated to make additional cash payments of
    up to an aggregate of $8 million upon the satisfaction of
    certain conditions. The Company allocated the purchase price to
    the tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their
    estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The
    $8 million of potential cash payments is comprised of
    $4.8 million for the achievement of revenue-based
    milestones that may be payable during the period from October
    2006 through January 2009 and $3.2 million based on the
    achievement of technological milestones during the period from
    October 2006 through January 2009. If the revenue-based
    milestone is met by January 2009, it will be recorded as
    additional goodwill. The technological milestones required
    post-acquisition services to be rendered and, as such, the
    Company recorded them as compensation expense in fiscal 2008.
    These technological milestones were achieved during fiscal 2008
    and will be paid during fiscal 2009. The purchase price included
    $5.1 million of in-process technology that had not yet
    reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use
    and was charged to operations during the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2006. The in-process technology related to technologies
    currently in development for analog and digital microphone

pre-amplifiers.

The Company determined the fair value of the in-process
    technology with the assistance of a third party using the income
    approach. At the time of the acquisition, the in-process
    technology was approximately 69% complete. The Company completed
    the in-process research and development projects during fiscal
    2007. The acquisition also included $8.3 million of
    intangible assets that the Company is amortizing over their
    estimated useful lives of five years using an accelerated
    amortization method that reflects the estimated pattern of
    economic use.

The Company has not provided pro forma results of operations for
    TTPCom, Integrant and AudioAsics herein as they were not
    material to the Company on either an individual or an aggregate
    basis. The Company included the results of operations of each
    acquisition in its consolidated statement of income from the
    date of such acquisition.

Deferred
    Compensation Plan Liability and Other Noncurrent
    Liabilities

The deferred compensation plan liability relates to obligations
    due under the Deferred Compensation Plan. The Deferred
    Compensation Plan allows certain members of management and other
    highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer
    receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. Prior to
    January 1, 2005, participants could also defer gains on
    stock options and restricted stock granted before July 23,
    1997. The balance represents Deferred Compensation Plan
    participant accumulated deferrals, and earnings thereon, since
    the inception of the Deferred Compensation Plan, net of
    withdrawals. The total expense to the Company of the Deferred
    Compensation Plan was $0.7 million in fiscal 2008,
    $0.3 million in fiscal 2007 and $1.0 million in fiscal
    2006. The Company’s liability under the Deferred
    Compensation Plan is an unsecured general obligation of the
    Company. Other noncurrent liabilities primarily relate to
    pension liabilities.

During fiscal 2006, the Company distributed $254.1 million
    from the Deferred Compensation Plan as a result of participant
    terminations or at the direction of the participants. This
    amount represented compensation

and/or

stock
    option gains previously deferred by those participants pursuant

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Settlement
    of the SEC’s Previously Announced Stock Option
    Investigation

On May 30, 2008, the Company and its President and CEO,
    Mr. Jerald G. Fishman, reached a settlement with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission, thereby concluding the
    Commission’s investigation into the Company’s stock
    option granting practices. Neither the Company nor
    Mr. Fishman admitted or denied any of the Commission’s
    allegations or findings.

As previously disclosed, the Commission concluded that: the
    appropriate grant date for the September 4, 1998 options
    should have been September 8, 1998 (which is one trading
    day later than the date that was used to price the options); the
    appropriate grant date for the November 30, 1999 options
    should have been November 29, 1999 (which is one trading
    day earlier than the date that was used to price the options);
    and the appropriate grant date for the July 18, 2001
    options should have been July 26, 2001 (which is five
    trading days later than the date that was used to price the
    options).

In connection with the settlement, the Company consented to a

cease-and-desist

order under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act
    and

Rule 10b-5

thereunder, paid a civil money penalty of $3 million, and
    repriced options granted to Mr. Fishman in 1999 and 2001.
    No other options granted by the Company were affected by the
    settlement. Mr. Fishman consented to a

cease-and-desist

order under Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the
    Securities Act, paid a civil money penalty of $1 million,
    and made a disgorgement payment of $450,000 (plus interest) with
    respect to options granted in 1998.

The Company determined that no restatement of its historical
    financial results is necessary due to the settlement.

Other
    Legal Proceedings

On October 13, 2006, a purported class action complaint was
    filed in the United States District Court for the District of
    Massachusetts on behalf of participants in the Company’s
    Investment Partnership Plan from October 5, 2000 to the
    present. The complaint named the Company, certain of its
    officers and directors, and its Investment Partnership Plan
    Administration Committee as defendants. The complaint alleged
    purported violations of federal law in connection with the
    Company’s option granting practices during the years 1998,
    1999, 2000, and 2001, including breaches of fiduciary duties
    owed to participants and beneficiaries of the Company’s
    Investment Partnership Plan under the Employee Retirement Income
    Security Act. The complaint sought unspecified monetary damages,
    as well as equitable and injunctive relief. On October 22,
    2008, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal with
    prejudice of this matter and each party agreed to dismiss its
    claims against the other party, thereby concluding this matter
    without any payment by the Company to the other party.

From time to time in the ordinary course of our business,
    various claims, charges and litigation are asserted or commenced
    against the Company arising from, or related to, contractual
    matters, patents, trademarks, personal injury, environmental
    matters, product liability, insurance coverage and personnel and
    employment disputes. As to such claims and litigation, the
    Company can give no assurance that we will prevail.

While the Company does not believe that any current legal
    matters will have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial position, an adverse outcome of any of
    these matters is possible and could have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations
    or cash flows in the quarter or annual period in which one or
    more of these matters are resolved.

Maxim
    Litigation Settlement

The Company executed a legal settlement with Maxim Integrated
    Products, Inc. (Maxim) during the second quarter of fiscal 2007,
    which resulted in the Company receiving $19 million. The
    Company recorded $8.5 million as a credit to legal expense
    in selling, marketing, general and administrative expense
    because this amount represents



ANALOG
    DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the fair value of external legal costs incurred by the Company
    in this matter. The remaining $10.5 million has been
    recorded in other income because the amount was not related to
    the reimbursement of external legal costs and management deems
    it to be an isolated event. This amount is earned in full
    because the Company has no future obligation to Maxim with
    respect to this payment.

14.

Retirement
    Plans

The Company and its subsidiaries have various savings and
    retirement plans covering substantially all employees. The
    Company maintains a defined contribution plan for the benefit of
    its eligible U.S. employees. This plan provides for Company
    contributions of up to 5% of each participant’s total
    eligible compensation. In addition, the Company contributes an
    amount equal to each participant’s pre-tax contribution, if
    any, up to a maximum of 3% of each participant’s total
    eligible compensation. The total expense related to the defined
    contribution plan for U.S. employees was $22.6 million
    in fiscal 2008, $20.8 million in fiscal 2007 and
    $22.0 million in fiscal 2006. The Company also has various
    defined benefit pension and other retirement plans for certain

non-U.S. employees

that are consistent with local statutory requirements and
    practices. The total expense related to the various defined
    benefit pension and other retirement plans for certain

non-U.S. employees

was $13.9 million in fiscal 2008, $17.3 million in
    fiscal 2007 and $15.7 million in fiscal 2006.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company adopted the
    provisions of SFAS 158,

Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and other Postretirement
    Plans — an amendment of FASB Statement No. 87,
    88, 106 and 132(R)

(SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires
    that the funded status of defined-benefit post retirement plans
    be recognized on the company’s consolidated balance sheets,
    and changes in the funded status be reflected in comprehensive
    (loss) income. SFAS 158 also requires the measurement date
    of the plan’s funded status to be the same as the
    company’s fiscal year end, which will be effective for the
    Company in fiscal 2009.

Non-U.S.

Plan Disclosures

The Company’s funding policy for its foreign defined
    benefit pension plans is consistent with the local requirements
    of each country. The plans’ assets consist primarily of
    U.S. and

non-U.S. equity

securities, bonds, property and cash. The benefit obligations
    and related assets under these plans have been measured at
    September 30, 2008 and September 30, 2007.

The accumulated benefit obligation for

non-U.S. pension

plans was $107.4 million and $128.6 million at
    September 30, 2008 and September 30, 2007,
    respectively.

The projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets
    for

non-U.S. pension

plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan
    assets were $149.4 million and $120.9 million,
    respectively, at September 30, 2008 and $86.8 million
    and $64.0 million, respectively, at September 30, 2007.

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit
    obligation, and fair value of plan assets for

non-U.S. pension

plans with accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan
    assets were $37.1 million, $32.8 million, and
    $16.6 million, respectively, at September 30, 2008 and
    $46.4 million, $40.1 million, and $24.3 million,
    respectively, at September 30, 2007.

The range of assumptions used for the

    within the various countries. The projected benefit obligation
    was determined using the following weighted average assumptions:

The expected long-term rate of return on assets is a weighted
    average of the long-term rates of return selected for the
    various countries where the Company has funded pension plans.
    The expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption is
    selected based on the facts and circumstances that exist as of
    the measurement date, and the specific portfolio mix of plan
    assets. Management, in conjunction with its actuaries, reviewed
    anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset
    categories and considered the asset allocation strategy adopted
    by the Company and or the trustees of the plans. While the
    review considered recent fund performance and historical
    returns, the assumption is primarily a long-term, prospective
    rate.

Expected fiscal 2009 Company contributions and estimated future
    benefit payments are as follows:

The fundamental goal underlying the pension plans’
    investment policy is to achieve a total rate of return that
    exceeds inflation over the long-term by using a certain mix of
    assets depending on the profile of the specific plan. Investment
    practices must comply with applicable laws and regulations.

The Company’s investment strategy is based on an
    expectation that equity securities will outperform debt
    securities over the long term. Accordingly, in order to maximize
    the return on assets, a majority of assets are invested in
    equities. Investments within each asset class are diversified to
    reduce the impact of losses in single investments. The use of
    derivative instruments is permitted where appropriate and
    necessary to achieve overall investment policy objectives and
    asset class targets.

The Company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage
    targets and appropriate benchmarks for each significant asset
    class to obtain a prudent balance between return and risk. The
    interaction between plan assets and benefit obligations is
    periodically studied by the Company and its actuaries to assist
    in the establishment of strategic asset allocation targets.

    Company’s state credit carryovers that began expiring in
    2008.

The Company has provided for potential liabilities due in the
    various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Judgment is
    required in determining the worldwide income tax expense
    provision. In the ordinary course of global business, there are
    many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax
    outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a
    consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related
    entities. Although the Company believes its estimates are
    reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome
    of these matters will not be different than that which is
    reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals.
    Such differences could have a material impact on the
    Company’s income tax provision and operating results in the
    period in which such determination is made.

On November 4, 2007 (the first day of its 2008 fiscal
    year), the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(FIN 48).
    FIN 48 differs from the prior standards in that it requires
    companies to determine whether it is “more likely than
    not” that a tax position will be sustained upon examination
    by the appropriate taxing authorities before any benefit can be
    recorded in the financial statements. An uncertain income tax
    position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50%
    likelihood of being sustained. There were no changes to the
    Company’s liabilities for uncertain tax positions as a
    result of the adoption of FIN 48. As of November 1,
    2008, the Company had a liability of $13.8 million for
    gross unrealized tax benefits, all of which, if settled in the
    Company’s favor, would lower the Company’s effective
    tax rate in the period recorded. In addition, as of
    November 1, 2008, the Company had a liability of
    approximately $6.4 million for interest and penalties. In
    accordance with FIN 48, the total liability of
    $20.2 million for uncertain tax positions is classified as
    non-current, and included in other non-current liabilities,
    because the Company believes that the ultimate payment or
    settlement of these liabilities will not occur within the next
    twelve months. Prior to the adoption of FIN 48, these
    amounts were included in current income tax payable. The Company
    includes interest and penalties related to



ANALOG
    DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for taxes in the
    condensed consolidated statements of income, and as a result, no
    change in classification was made upon adopting FIN 48. The
    condensed consolidated statements of income for fiscal year 2008
    include $1.3 million of interest and penalties related to
    these uncertain tax positions. Due to the complexity associated
    with its tax uncertainties, the Company cannot make a reasonably
    reliable estimate as to the period in which it expects to settle
    the liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions.

The following table summarizes the changes in the total amounts
    of uncertain tax positions for fiscal 2008.

Fiscal
    Year 2001 to 2003 IRS Examination

During fiscal year 2006, the United States Internal Revenue
    Service (the IRS) completed its examination of fiscal years
    2001, 2002 and 2003 and issued their report. The Company agreed
    to accept this report and filed its 2005 and 2006 tax return and
    an amended return for 2004 conforming to the methodologies
    agreed to during the

2001-2003

examination. The completion of this examination, including the
    reversal of accruals for taxes and penalties and the filing of
    refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the
    completion of the IRS examination, resulted in an income tax
    benefit of $35.2 million in fiscal year 2006.

Fiscal
    Year 2004 and 2005 IRS Examination

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the IRS completed its
    field examination of fiscal years 2004 and 2005. On
    January 2, 2008, the IRS issued its report for fiscal 2004
    and 2005, which included proposed adjustments related to these
    two fiscal years. The Company has provided for taxes and
    penalties related to certain of these proposed adjustments.
    There are four items with a potential total tax liability of
    $46 million that the Company concluded, based on
    discussions with its tax advisors, are not likely to result in
    additional tax liability. Therefore, the Company has not
    recorded any tax liability for these items and is appealing
    these proposed adjustments through the normal processes for the
    resolution of differences between the IRS and taxpayers. Two of
    the unresolved matters are one-time issues and pertain to
    Section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code related to the
    beneficial tax treatment of dividends from foreign owned
    companies under The American Jobs Creation Act. The other
    matters pertain to the computation of research and development
    (R&D) tax credits and the profits earned from manufacturing
    activities carried on outside the United States. These latter
    two matters could impact taxes payable for fiscal 2004 and 2005
    as well as for subsequent years.

Fiscal
    Year 2006 and 2007 IRS Examination

During fiscal 2006, the IRS invited the Company to participate
    in the Compliance Assurance Process (CAP), which is a voluntary
    pilot program the IRS is conducting for a limited number of
    large business taxpayers. The objective of CAP is to reduce
    taxpayer burden associated with IRS audits while assuring the
    IRS of the accuracy of tax returns prior to filing. The Company
    participated in CAP for fiscal 2006 and 2007. Under the program,
    the IRS is expected to work with the Company contemporaneously
    to achieve federal tax compliance and resolve issues prior to
    the filing of a tax return. CAP is designed to eliminate or
    substantially reduce the need for post-filing examinations of
    future tax returns. The IRS and the Company have agreed on the
    treatment of a number of issues that have been included in an
    Issue Resolutions Agreement related to the 2006 and 2007 tax
    returns. However, no agreement was reached on the tax treatment
    of a number of issues, including the same R&D credit and
    foreign manufacturing issues mentioned above related to fiscal
    2004 and 2005. The IRS has not completed its audit of the
    pricing of intercompany sales (transfer pricing). The Company
    has not provided for any additional taxes in respect of the
    examination of the fiscal 2006 and 2007 tax returns.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Fiscal
    Year 2008 IRS Examination

The Company is not participating in the CAP for fiscal year 2008.

Although the Company believes its estimates of income tax
    payable are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the
    Company will prevail in the matters raised and that the outcome
    of one or all of these matters will not be different than that
    which is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and
    accruals. The Company believes such differences would not have a
    material impact on the Company’s financial condition but
    could have a material impact on the Company’s income tax
    provision, operating results and operating cash flows in the
    period in which such matters are resolved.

16.

Gain on
    Sale of Product Line

During fiscal 2006, the Company completed the sale to Ikanos
    Communications, Inc. of its DSP-based digital subscriber line
    (DSL) application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and network
    processor product line. The Company received approximately
    $23.1 million in cash for the product line and after
    providing for the write-off of inventory, fixed assets and other
    costs incurred to complete the transaction, recorded a net gain
    of $13.0 million in nonoperating income during fiscal 2006.

17.

Revolving
    Credit Facility

A significant portion of the Company’s cash and short term
    investments balance is currently held outside the United States
    in various foreign subsidiaries. As the Company intends to
    reinvest certain of its foreign earnings indefinitely, this cash
    is not available to meet certain of the Company’s cash
    requirements in the United States, including for cash dividends
    and common stock repurchases. The Company entered into a
    five-year, $165 million unsecured revolving credit facility
    with certain institutional lenders in May 2008 in order to
    supplement its occasional cash requirements in the United
    States. To date, the Company has not borrowed under this credit
    facility but the Company may borrow in the future and use the
    proceeds for support of commercial paper issuance, stock
    repurchases, dividend payments, acquisitions, capital
    expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate
    purposes. Any advances under this credit agreement will accrue
    interest at rates that are equal to LIBOR plus a margin that is
    based on the Company’s leverage ratio. The terms of this
    facility also include financial covenants that require the
    Company to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and not
    exceed a maximum leverage ratio. The terms of the facility also
    impose restrictions on the Company’s ability to undertake
    certain transactions, to create certain liens on assets and to
    incur certain subsidiary indebtedness.

18.

Subsequent
    Events

On November 20, 2008, the Board of Directors of the Company
    declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per outstanding share of
    common stock. The dividend will be paid on December 24,
    2008 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on
    December 5, 2008.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Analog Devices, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Analog Devices, Inc. as of November 1, 2008 and
    November 3, 2007, and the related consolidated statements
    of income, shareholders’ equity, comprehensive income, and
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    November 1, 2008. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(c). These
    financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Analog Devices, Inc. at November 1,
    2008 and November 3, 2007, and the consolidated results of
    its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended November 1, 2008, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
    information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 14 to the financial statements,
    effective November 3, 2007, the Company adopted Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).

Additionally, as discussed
    in Note 15 to the financial statements, effective
    November 4, 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting
    Standards Board Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an Interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of Analog Devices, Inc.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of November 1, 2008, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission and our report dated November 21, 2008
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

(a)

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
    Procedures.

Our management, with the
    participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of Analog’s disclosure
    controls and procedures as of November 1, 2008. The term
    “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a
    company that are designed to ensure that information required to
    be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or
    submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
    SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures
    include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
    ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in
    the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
    accumulated and communicated to the company’s management,
    including its principal executive and principal financial
    officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and
    procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
    provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives
    and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating
    the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
    procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls
    and procedures as of November 1, 2008, our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such
    date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at
    the reasonable assurance level.

(b)

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal
    control over financial reporting is defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

or

15d-15(f)

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers and effected by the company’s board of directors,
    management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
    regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
    preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
    includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of the company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
    that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
    only in accordance with authorizations of management and
    directors of the company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
    are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting as of November 1, 2008. In
    making this assessment, the company’s management used the
    criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
    of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated
    Framework.

Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of
    November 1, 2008, our internal control over financial
    reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an
    attestation report on our internal control over financial
    reporting. This report appears below.

Attestation Report of the Registered Public

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Analog Devices, Inc.

We have audited Analog Devices, Inc.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of November 1, 2008, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Analog Devices,
    Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    management’s report on internal control over financial
    reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Analog Devices, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of November 1, 2008, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Analog Devices, Inc. as of
    November 1, 2008 and November 3, 2007, and the related
    consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity,
    comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years
    in the period ended November 1, 2008 of Analog Devices,
    Inc. and our report dated November 21, 2008 expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

    Reporting.

No change in our internal control over
    financial reporting (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

    quarter ended November 1, 2008 that has materially
    affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
    internal control over financial reporting.
