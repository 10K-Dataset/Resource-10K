ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Company
    Overview

We are a world leader in the design, manufacture and marketing
    of high-performance analog, mixed-signal and digital signal
    processing integrated circuits used in industrial,
    communication, computer and consumer applications. Since our
    inception in 1965, we have focused on solving the engineering
    challenges associated with signal processing in electronic
    equipment. Our products are embedded inside electronics that
    people come into contact with every day. Real world signal
    processing describes the process of converting real-world
    phenomena such as temperature, motion, pressure, light and sound
    into electrical signals to be used in a wide array of electronic
    equipment including industrial process control, factory
    automation systems, defense electronics, portable wireless
    communications devices, cellular basestations, central office
    networking equipment, computers, automobiles, medical imaging
    equipment, digital cameras and digital televisions. Signal
    processing technology is a critical element of high-speed
    communications, digital entertainment, and other consumer,
    computer and industrial applications. As new generations of
    digital applications evolve, they generate new needs for
    high-performance analog signal processing and digital signal
    processing, or DSP, technology. We produce a wide range of
    products that are designed to meet the signal processing
    technology needs of a broad base of customers.

In September 2007, we entered into a definitive agreement to
    sell our baseband chipset business and related support
    operations, or Baseband Chipset Business, to MediaTek Inc.
    Accordingly, these operations have been presented as a
    discontinued operation within the consolidated financial
    statements in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or
    Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (SFAS 144)

. The financial
    statements and related footnote disclosures reflect the results
    of this business in discontinued operations, net of applicable
    income taxes for all reporting periods presented. Unless
    otherwise noted, the discussions contained in the Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K

relate only to results from continuing operations. The Company
    expects to recognize a gain from the sale of the Baseband
    Chipset Business upon completion of the sale in the first
    quarter of fiscal 2008.

During our fiscal year ended November 3, 2007, or fiscal
    2007, approximately 47% of our product revenue came from the
    industrial market, which includes factory automation, medical
    equipment, scientific instrumentation, automatic test equipment,
    automotive electronics, security equipment, and aerospace and
    defense systems.

Revenue from the communications market represented approximately
    22% of our fiscal 2007 product revenue. Communications
    applications include wireless handsets and wireless
    basestations, as well as products used for high-speed access to
    the Internet, including central office networking equipment.

The demand for our products used in high-performance consumer
    electronics represented approximately 22% of our product revenue
    for fiscal 2007. Applications in this market include digital
    cameras and camcorders, flat-panel and plasma digital
    televisions, video game applications and surround sound audio
    systems.

We also serve the personal computer and network server markets
    with products that monitor and manage power usage, and enable
    high-quality audio. In fiscal 2007, the computer market
    accounted for approximately 9% of our product revenue.

We sell our products worldwide through a direct sales force,
    third-party distributors and independent sales representatives
    and through our website. We have direct sales offices in 18
    countries, including the United States.

We are headquartered near Boston, in Norwood, Massachusetts, and
    have manufacturing facilities in Massachusetts, Ireland and the
    Philippines. We were founded in 1965 and are incorporated in
    Massachusetts. As of November 3, 2007, we employed
    approximately 9,600 individuals worldwide. Our common stock is
    listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ADI and
    is included in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.

We maintain a website with the address www.analog.com. We are
    not including the information contained on our website as a part
    of, or incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on

Industry
    Background

All electronic signals fall into one of two categories, analog
    or digital. Analog, also known as linear, signals represent
    real-world phenomena, such as temperature, pressure, sound,
    speed and motion. This information can be detected and measured
    using analog sensors by generating continuously-varying voltages
    and currents. The signals from these sensors are initially
    processed using analog methods, such as amplification, filtering
    and shaping. They are then usually converted to digital form for
    storage or further manipulation. The further manipulation of the
    signals after conversion to digital form is called “digital
    signal processing.” Digital signals represent the
    “ones” and “zeros” of binary arithmetic and
    are either on or off. Digital signals are frequently converted
    back to analog form for functions such as video display, audio
    output or control. These manipulations and transformations from
    analog to digital and back to analog are known as
    “real-world signal processing.”

Significant developments in semiconductor technology in recent
    years have substantially increased the performance and
    functionality of integrated circuits, or ICs, used in signal
    processing applications. These developments include: the ongoing
    transition to digital media for communications, music,
    photography, and video, which has increased the need for
    precise, high-speed signal conditioning interfaces between the
    analog world and digital electronics; the ability to combine
    analog and digital signal processing capability on a single
    chip, thereby making possible more highly-integrated solutions;
    and the widespread application of low-cost, high-performance
    microprocessor-based systems, which enables customers to convert
    analog information into digital information that can be managed
    by these microprocessors. At the same time, the convergence of
    computing, communications, and consumer electronics has resulted
    in end products that incorporate state-of-the-art signal
    processing capability onto fewer chips and with less power
    consumption. Our products are designed to be used within
    electronic equipment to achieve higher performance, including
    greater speed, improved accuracy, more efficient signal
    processing and minimized power consumption.

Principal
    Products

We design, manufacture and market a broad line of
    high-performance ICs that incorporate analog, mixed-signal and
    digital signal processing technologies. Our ICs are designed to
    address a wide range of real-world signal processing
    applications. Across the entire range of our product portfolio
    are both general-purpose products used by a broad range of
    customers and applications as well as application-specific
    products designed for specific clusters of customers in key
    target markets. By using readily available, high-performance,
    general-purpose products in their systems, our customers can
    reduce the time they need to bring new products to market. Given
    the high cost of developing more customized ICs, our standard
    products often provide the most cost-effective solution for many
    low to medium volume applications. However, in some
    communications, computer and consumer products, we focus on
    working with leading customers to design application-specific
    solutions. We begin with our existing core technologies in data
    conversion, amplification, power management, radio frequency and
    DSP, and devise a solution to more closely meet the needs of a
    specific customer or group of customers. Because we have already
    developed the core technology for our general-purpose products,
    we can create application-specific solutions quickly.

We produce and market several thousand products. Our ten
    highest revenue products, in the aggregate, accounted for
    approximately 10% of our revenue for fiscal 2007. The majority
    of our products are proprietary, meaning equivalent products are
    not available from competitors. A limited number of other
    companies may provide products with similar functions.



Analog
    Products

Our analog IC technology has been the foundation of our business
    for over four decades, and we believe we are one of the
    world’s largest suppliers of analog ICs. Our analog signal
    processing ICs are primarily high-performance devices, generally
    defined as devices that support a minimum of 10-bits of accuracy
    and a minimum of 50 megahertz of speed. The principal
    advantages these products have versus competitors’ products
    include higher accuracy, lower cost per function, smaller size,
    lower power consumption and fewer components resulting in
    improved reliability. The majority of our analog signal
    processing IC product revenue is attributable to sales of data
    converters and amplifiers. The data converter and amplifier
    product categories represented approximately 66% of our fiscal
    2007 product revenue. Over the past several years we have been
    expanding our analog IC product offerings along the entire
    signal chain and into product areas such as radio frequency
    integrated circuits, or RF ICs, power management products, phase
    locked loops and high-speed clock ICs.

The majority of our analog IC products are proprietary to us in
    their design and our product portfolio addresses a wide range of
    applications. Our product portfolio includes several thousand
    analog ICs, any one of which can have as many as several hundred
    customers. Our analog ICs typically have long product life
    cycles. Our analog IC customers include both original equipment
    manufacturers, or OEMs, and customers who build electronic
    subsystems for integration into larger systems.

Our analog technology base also includes products using an
    advanced IC technology known in the industry as surface
    micromachining, which is used to produce semiconductor products
    known as micro-electromechanical systems, or MEMS. This
    technology enables extremely small mechanical sensing elements
    to be built on the surface of a chip along with supporting
    circuitry. In addition to incorporating an electro-mechanical
    structure, these devices also have analog circuitry for
    conditioning signals obtained from the sensing element. The
    integration of signal conditioning and MEMS is a unique feature
    of our products which we call
    iMEMS

®

.
    Our iMEMS product portfolio includes accelerometers used to
    sense acceleration, and gyroscopes used to sense position. The
    majority of our current revenue from MEMS products is derived
    from accelerometers used by automotive manufacturers in airbag
    applications and in video game applications. However, revenue
    from consumer and industrial customers is increasing as we
    develop products using this technology for applications in these
    end markets.

DSP
    Products

DSPs are processors that are optimized for high-speed numeric
    calculations, which are essential for instantaneous, or
    real-time, processing of digital data generated, in most cases,
    from analog to digital signal conversion. DSP product revenue
    represented 10% of our fiscal 2007 product revenue. Our DSP
    products are designed to be fully programmable and to
    efficiently execute specialized software programs, or
    algorithms, associated with processing digitized real-time,
    real-world data. Programmable DSPs provide the flexibility to
    modify the device’s function quickly and inexpensively
    using software. We offer both general-purpose and
    application-specific DSP products. General-purpose DSP IC
    customers typically write their own algorithms using software
    development tools that we provide and software development tools
    they obtain from third-party suppliers. Our application-specific
    DSP products typically include software for applications such as
    audio processing, telecommunications or image processing. Our
    DSPs are designed in families of products that share a common
    architecture and therefore can execute the same software. We
    support these products with easy-to-use, low-cost development
    tools, which are designed to reduce our customers’ product
    development costs and time-to-market.

Markets
    and Applications

The following describes some of the characteristics of, and
    customer products within, our major markets:

Industrial

— Our industrial market
    includes the following areas:

Industrial Process Automation

— Our industrial
    process automation market includes applications such as factory
    automation systems, automatic process control systems, robotics,
    environmental control systems and automatic test equipment.
    These applications generally require ICs that offer performance
    greater than that available from commodity-level ICs, but
    generally do not have production volumes that warrant custom or



application-specific ICs. Combinations of analog, mixed-signal
    and DSP ICs are usually employed to achieve the necessary
    functionality.

Instrumentation

— Our instrumentation market
    includes engineering, medical and scientific instruments. These
    applications are usually designed using the highest performance
    analog and mixed-signal ICs available. Customer products include
    oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, CT scanners, MRI equipment,
    blood analyzers and microscopes.

Defense/Aerospace

— The defense, commercial
    avionics and space markets all require high-performance ICs that
    meet rigorous environmental and reliability specifications. Many
    of our analog ICs can be supplied in versions that meet these
    standards. In addition, many products can be supplied to meet
    the standards required for broadcast satellites and other
    commercial space applications. Most of our products sold in this
    market are specifically tested versions of products derived from
    our standard product offering. Customer products include
    navigation systems, flight simulators, radar systems and
    security devices.

Automotive

— Although the automotive market has
    historically been served with low-cost, low-performance ICs,
    demand has emerged for higher performance devices for a wide
    range of safety and entertainment applications, as well as
    powertrain electronics. In response, we have developed products
    specifically for the automotive market. We supply a MEMS IC used
    as a crash sensor in airbag systems, roll-over sensing, global
    positioning satellite, or GPS, automotive navigation systems,
    anti-lock brakes and “smart” suspension systems. In
    addition, our analog and DSP ICs have application in engine
    control, in-cabin electronics, audio and collision avoidance
    systems.

Communications

— The development of
    broadband, wireless and Internet infrastructures around the
    world has created an important market for our communications
    products. Communications technology involves the acquisition of
    analog signals that are converted from analog to digital and
    digital to analog form during the process of transmitting and
    receiving data. The need for higher speed and reduced power
    consumption, coupled with more reliable, bandwidth-efficient
    communications, has been creating demand for our products. Our
    products are used in the full spectrum of signal processing for
    audio, data, image and video communication. In wireless and
    broadband communication applications, our products are
    incorporated into cellular handsets, cellular base station
    equipment, pagers, PBX switches, routers and remote access
    servers.

Consumer

— Increased market demand for
    digital entertainment systems and the consumer demand for high
    quality voice, music, movies and photographs has allowed us to
    combine analog and digital design capability to provide
    solutions that meet the rigorous cost requirements of the
    consumer electronics market. The emergence of high-performance,
    feature-rich consumer products, such as digital camcorders and
    cameras, home theater systems, LCD and plasma digital
    televisions, video projectors, video game applications and
    high-definition DVD recorders/players, has created a market for
    our high-performance ICs with a high level of specific
    functionality.

Computer

— We currently supply ICs used
    in computers for enhanced audio input and output capability for
    business and entertainment applications. These products are sold
    under the brand name,
    SoundMAX

®

.
    A variety of our analog products also have application in
    network servers and laptop PCs, as well as computer peripherals
    such as displays, printers and scanners.

Research
    and Development

Our markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and
    advances. Accordingly, we make substantial investments in the
    design and development of new products and manufacturing
    processes, and the improvement of existing products and
    manufacturing processes. We spent approximately
    $519 million during fiscal 2007 on the design, development
    and improvement of new and existing products and manufacturing
    processes, compared to approximately $469 million during
    fiscal 2006 and approximately $438 million during fiscal
    2005.

Our research and development strategy focuses on building
    technical leadership in core technologies for signal sensing,
    conditioning, conversion and processing. In addition, we have
    been increasing our investment in analog products used for power
    management. In support of our research and development
    activities, we employ thousands of engineers involved in product
    and manufacturing process development at over 40 design centers
    and manufacturing sites located throughout the world.



Patents
    and Other Intellectual Property Rights

We seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our
    technology and products through the use of patents, copyrights,
    trademarks and trade secret laws. We have a program to file
    applications for and obtain patents, copyrights, and trademarks
    in the United States and in selected foreign countries where we
    believe filing for such protection is appropriate. We also seek
    to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by
    nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate
    confidentiality agreements. We have obtained a substantial
    number of patents and trademarks in the United States and in
    other countries. As of November 3, 2007, we held
    approximately 1,388 U.S. patents and approximately 488
    non-provisional pending U.S. patent applications. There can
    be no assurance, however, that the rights obtained can be
    successfully enforced against infringing products in every
    jurisdiction. In connection with our announced divestiture
    transactions expected to close in fiscal 2008, we will transfer
    ownership of approximately 73 U.S. patents and 60
    non-provisional pending U.S. patent applications. While our
    patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets provide some
    advantage and protection, we believe our competitive position
    and future success is largely determined by such factors as the
    system and application knowledge, innovative skills,
    technological expertise, and management ability and experience
    of our personnel, the range and success of new products being
    developed by us, our market brand recognition and ongoing
    marketing efforts, customer service and technical support. It is
    generally our policy to seek patent protection for significant
    inventions that may be patented, though we may elect, in certain
    cases, not to seek patent protection even for significant
    inventions, if we determine other protection, such as
    maintaining the invention as a trade secret, to be more
    advantageous. We also have trademarks that are used in the
    conduct of our business to distinguish genuine Analog Devices
    products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs to
    promote our brands and identify products containing genuine
    Analog Devices components. In addition, we have registered
    certain of our mask sets, which are akin to the blueprint for
    building an IC, under the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of
    1984.

There can be no assurance that any patent will issue on pending
    applications or that any patent issued will provide substantive
    protection for the technology or product covered by it. There
    also can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent
    similar technology or reverse engineer our products or that our
    confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, wafer
    foundries and other suppliers and vendors will be adequate to
    protect our interests. Moreover, the laws of countries in which
    we design, manufacture and market our products may afford little
    or no effective protection of our proprietary technology.

The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims
    and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property
    rights, including claims arising under our contractual
    indemnification of our customers. We have received from time to
    time, and may receive in the future, claims from third parties
    asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents
    or other intellectual property rights. In the event a third
    party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a
    license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms,
    or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop
    production of products incorporating that intellectual property,
    and our operating results could be materially and adversely
    affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or
    other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us
    against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be
    costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. See
    Note 12 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial
    Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for information concerning pending litigation that involves us.
    An adverse outcome in these matters or other litigation could
    have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
    position or on our consolidated results of operations or cash
    flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved.

Sales
    Channels

We sell our products in North America and internationally
    through a direct sales force, third-party distributors,
    independent sales representatives and via our worldwide website
    on the Internet.

Approximately 53% of our fiscal 2007 product revenue was derived
    from sales made through distributors. Revenue is deferred on
    sales made through distributors until the distributors resell
    our products to the end customer, known as “100% sell
    out” or “100% sell through” in the industry.
    These distributors typically maintain an inventory of our
    products. Some of them also sell products competitive with our
    products, including those for which we are an alternate source.
    Sales to certain distributors are made under agreements that
    provide protection to the distributors



for their inventory of our products including limited product
    return privileges and protection against price reductions and
    products that are slow-moving or that we have discontinued.

The categorization of sales into geographic regions is based
    upon the location of the customer.

Approximately 26% of our fiscal 2007 product revenue was to
    customers in the United States. As of November 3, 2007, we
    had 11 direct sales offices in the United States.

Approximately 24% of our fiscal 2007 product revenue was to
    customers in Europe. As of November 3, 2007, we had direct
    sales offices in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany,
    Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.

Approximately 20% of our fiscal 2007 product revenue was to
    customers in Japan.

Approximately 13% of our fiscal 2007 product revenue was to
    customers in China and approximately 17% was to customers
    elsewhere in Asia, principally Taiwan and Korea. As of
    November 3, 2007, we had direct sales offices in the Asia
    region in China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Singapore, and
    Taiwan.

We also have sales representatives

and/or

distributors in over 40 countries outside North America,
    including countries where we also have direct sales offices. For
    further detail regarding revenue and financial information about
    geographic areas, see our Consolidated Financial Statements and
    Note 4 in the related Notes contained in Item 8 of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Our worldwide technical direct field sales efforts are supported
    by an extensive promotional program that includes editorial
    coverage and paid advertising in trade publications, direct mail
    programs, promotional brochures, technical seminars and
    participation in trade shows. We publish and distribute
    full-length databooks, product catalogs, applications guides,
    technical handbooks and detailed data sheets for individual
    products. We also provide this information and sell products via
    our worldwide website on the Internet. We maintain a staff of
    field application engineers who aid customers in incorporating
    our products into their products.

We have tens of thousands of customers worldwide. Our largest
    single customer, excluding distributors, represented
    approximately 3% of our fiscal 2007 product revenue, and our 20
    largest customers, excluding distributors, accounted for
    approximately 27% of our fiscal 2007 product revenue.

Seasonality

Sales to customers during our first fiscal quarter are sometimes
    lower than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our
    customers during the holiday season. In general, the seasonality
    for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on
    our results of operations. In addition, as explained in our risk
    factors included elsewhere in this report, our revenue is more
    likely to be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by
    cyclicality in the semiconductor industry.

Foreign
    Operations

Through subsidiaries and affiliates, we conduct business in
    numerous countries outside the United States. During fiscal
    2007, approximately 74% of our product revenue was derived from
    customers in international markets. Our international business
    is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign
    operations, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
    rates and controls, import and export controls, and other laws,
    policies and regulations of foreign governments. Although we
    engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to
    currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance
    that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by
    changes in the exchange rate of the United States dollar against
    other currencies.

We have manufacturing facilities outside the United States in
    Ireland and the Philippines. In addition to being exposed to the
    ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry, we are
    also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in
    international operations and their impact on the United States
    economy in general, including the risks associated with ongoing
    uncertainties and political and economic instability in many
    countries around the world as well as the economic disruption
    from acts of terrorism, and the response to them by the United
    States and its allies. Other business risks associated with
    international operations include increased managerial



complexities, air transportation disruptions, expropriation,
    currency controls, currency exchange rate movement, additional
    costs related to foreign taxes, tariffs and freight rate
    increases, exposure to different business practices and legal
    standards, particularly with respect to price protection and
    intellectual property, trade and travel restrictions, pandemics,
    import and export license requirements and restrictions,
    difficulties in staffing and managing worldwide operations, and
    accounts receivable collections.

Production
    and Raw Materials

Monolithic integrated circuit components are manufactured in a
    sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer
    fabrication, wafer testing, cutting the wafer into individual
    “chips,” or dice, assembly of the dice into packages
    and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form.
    The raw materials used to manufacture these devices include
    silicon wafers, processing chemicals (including liquefied
    gases), precious metals and ceramic and plastic used for
    packaging.

We develop and employ a wide variety of proprietary
    manufacturing processes that are specifically tailored for use
    in fabricating high-performance linear, mixed-signal and MEMS
    ICs. We also use bipolar and complementary metal-oxide
    semiconductor, or CMOS, wafer fabrication processes.

Our IC products are fabricated both at our production facilities
    and by third-party wafer fabricators. Most of our analog
    products are manufactured in our own wafer fabrication
    facilities using proprietary processes. Our DSP products, and a
    portion of our analog products, are manufactured at third-party
    wafer-fabrication foundries using sub-micron digital CMOS
    processes. We operate wafer fabrication facilities in Wilmington
    and Cambridge, Massachusetts and Limerick, Ireland. We also
    operate test facilities located in the Philippines and use
    third-party subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our
    products.

Capital spending including that related to our Baseband Chipset
    Business, which is reflected as a discontinued operation, was
    $141.8 million in fiscal 2007, compared with
    $129.3 million in fiscal 2006. We currently plan to make
    capital expenditures of approximately $160 million in
    fiscal 2008.

Our products require a wide variety of components, raw materials
    and external foundry services, most of which we purchase from
    third-party suppliers. We have multiple sources for many of the
    components and materials that we purchase and incorporate into
    our products. However, a large portion of our external wafer
    purchases and foundry services are from a limited number of
    suppliers, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company
    (TSMC). If TSMC or any of our other key suppliers are unable or
    unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of
    components to us, on the time schedule and of the quality that
    we require, we may be forced to seek to engage additional or
    replacement suppliers, which could result in significant
    expenses and disruptions or delays in manufacturing, product
    development and shipment of product to our customers. Although
    we have experienced shortages of components, materials and
    external foundry services from time to time, these items have
    generally been available to us as needed.

Backlog

Backlog at the end of fiscal 2007 was approximately
    $408 million, up from approximately $376 million at
    the end of fiscal 2006. This backlog includes approximately
    $14 million and $10 million at November 3, 2007
    and October 28, 2006, respectively, from our CPU voltage
    regulation and PC thermal monitoring business that will be
    reclassified in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 to discontinued
    operations. Additional information relating to this divestiture
    is set forth below under the heading

Acquisitions,
    Divestitures and Investments.

We define backlog as of a
    particular date as firm orders with a customer or distributor
    requested delivery date within thirteen weeks. Backlog is
    impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead
    times available from suppliers, including us, in periods of
    depressed demand. In periods of increased demand, there is a
    tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of
    increasing backlog and, in some instances, we may not have
    manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders. As is
    customary in the semiconductor industry, we allow most orders to
    be cancelled or deliveries delayed by customers without
    significant penalty. Accordingly, we believe that our backlog at
    any time should not be used as an indication of our future
    revenue.



In some of our markets where end-user demand may be particularly
    volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders
    that require us to manufacture product and have it available for
    shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a
    binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product.
    At any given time, this situation could affect a portion of our
    backlog. As a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing
    costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the
    risk of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of
    sales and backlog. Further, those orders may be for products
    that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those
    cancelled orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of
    unsaleable products, resulting in potential inventory
    write-offs. As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles, for
    some of our products that are subject to these uncertainties,
    the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial.

Government
    Contracts

We estimate that approximately 3% of our fiscal 2007 product
    revenue was attributable to sales to the U.S. government
    and government contractors and subcontractors. Our government
    contract business is predominantly in the form of negotiated,
    firm fixed-price subcontracts. All such contracts and
    subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to termination
    at the election of the United States government.

Acquisitions,
    Divestitures and Investments

An element of our business strategy involves expansion through
    the acquisition of businesses, assets, products or technologies
    that allow us to complement our existing product offerings,
    expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce
    or enhance our technological capabilities. From time to time, we
    consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen our
    business.

In September 2007, we entered into a definitive agreement to
    sell our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc. We will also
    license to MediaTek Inc. related technology and intellectual
    property rights, subject to certain field of use restrictions.
    We expect to close the transaction during the first quarter of
    fiscal 2008.

In November 2007, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement
    with certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation, or
    ON, to sell our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring
    business. The business to be sold consists of core voltage
    regulator products for the CPU in computing and gaming
    applications and temperature sensors and fan-speed controllers
    for managing the temperature of the CPU. As part of the
    transition, we also agreed to enter into a one-year
    manufacturing supply arrangement with ON. We expect to close
    this transaction during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. This
    business met the assets held for sale criteria on
    November 8, 2007, and will therefore be accounted for as a
    discontinued operation in the first quarter of fiscal 2008.

Additional information relating to our disposition and
    acquisition activities during fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 is set
    forth in Note 2u. and Note 6 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Competition

We compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets
    that are highly competitive. We believe we are one of the
    largest suppliers of high-performance analog and mixed-signal
    processing components. Competitors for our analog and DSP
    products include Broadcom Corporation, Freescale Semiconductor
    Inc., Infineon Technologies, Intersil Corporation, Linear
    Technology Corporation, Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.,
    National Semiconductor Corporation, NXP Semiconductors, ST
    Microelectronics, Silicon Laboratories, Inc. and Texas
    Instruments, Inc.

We believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for
    real-world signal processing components depends upon several
    factors, including technical innovation, product quality and
    reliability, range of products, product price, customer service
    and technical support. We believe our technical innovation
    emphasizing product performance and reliability, supported by
    our commitment to strong customer service and technical support,
    enables us to compete in our chosen markets against both foreign
    and domestic semiconductor manufacturers.

Many other companies offer products that compete with our
    products, and some have greater financial, manufacturing,
    technical and marketing resources than we have. Some of our
    competitors may have better



established supply or development relationships with our current
    and potential customers. Additionally, some formerly independent
    competitors have been purchased by larger companies. Our
    competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized
    products into markets we serve. There can be no assurance that
    we will be able to compete successfully in the future against
    existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will
    not be adversely affected by increased price competition.

Environment

We are committed to protecting the environment and the health
    and safety of our employees, customers and the public. We
    endeavor to adhere to the most stringent standards across all of
    our facilities, to encourage pollution prevention and to strive
    towards continual improvement. We strive to achieve a standard
    of excellence in environmental, health and safety management
    practices as an integral part of our total quality management
    system.

Our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous
    environmental laws and regulations, particularly with respect to
    the storage, handling, use, discharge and disposal of certain
    chemicals, gases and other substances used or produced in the
    semiconductor manufacturing process. Compliance with these laws
    and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital
    expenditures, earnings, financial condition or competitive
    position. There can be no assurance, however, that current or
    future environmental laws and regulations will not impose costly
    requirements upon us. Any failure by us to comply with
    applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in
    fines, suspension of production, alteration of fabrication
    processes and legal liability.

Employees

As of November 3, 2007, we employed approximately 9,600
    individuals worldwide. Our future success depends in large part
    on the continued service of our key technical and senior
    management personnel, and on our ability to continue to attract,
    retain and motivate qualified employees, particularly those
    highly-skilled design, process, test and applications engineers
    involved in the design, support and manufacture of new and
    existing products and processes. We believe that relations with
    our employees are good; however, the competition for such
    personnel is intense, and the loss of key personnel could have a
    material adverse impact on our results of operations and
    financial condition.



ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other
    documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and
    uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ
    materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking
    statements contained in this report.

Our
    future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income
    are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate.

Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net
    income are difficult to predict and may be materially affected
    by a number of factors, including:

•

changes in customer demand for our products and for end products
    that incorporate our products;

•

the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us,
    our customers or our competitors;

•

competitive pricing pressures;

•

fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of
    wafers and other raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and
    test capacity;

•

the risk that our backlog could decline significantly;

•

the timing, delay or cancellation of significant customer orders
    and our ability to manage inventory;

•

our ability to hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of
    engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of
    our customers;

•

changes in geographic, product or customer mix;

•

potential significant litigation-related costs;

•

the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating
    expense levels;

•

the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide
    environmental regulations;

•

changes in our effective tax rate;

•

the effect of adverse changes in economic conditions in the
    United States and international markets; and

•

the effects of public health emergencies, natural disasters,
    terrorist activities, international conflicts and other events
    beyond our control.

In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been
    cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns. Our
    business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can
    be no assurance, depending on the mix of future business, that
    products stocked in inventory will not be rendered obsolete
    before we ship them. As a result of these and other factors,
    there can be no assurance that we will not experience material
    fluctuations in future revenue, gross margins and operating
    results on a quarterly or annual basis. In addition, if our
    revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income do not
    meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the
    market price of our common stock may decline.

Long-term
    contracts are not typical for us and reductions, cancellations
    or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our
    operating results.

In certain markets where end-user demand may be particularly
    volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders
    that require us to manufacture product and have it available for
    shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a
    binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product.
    At any given time, this situation could affect a portion of our
    backlog. As a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing
    costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the
    risk of cancellations of orders leading to a sharp reduction of
    sales and backlog. Further, those orders may be for products
    that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those
    cancelled orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of
    unsaleable products, resulting in potential inventory



write-offs. As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for
    certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties,
    the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial.
    Reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products
    could adversely affect our operating results.

Our
    future success depends upon our ability to continue to improve
    our products, develop and market new products, and identify and
    enter new markets.

Our success significantly depends on our continued ability to
    improve our products and develop and market new products.
    Product development and enhancement is often a complex,
    time-consuming and costly process involving significant
    investment in research and development. There can be no
    assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and
    improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new
    and improved products, if developed, will achieve market
    acceptance. Our products generally must conform to various
    evolving and sometimes competing industry standards, which may
    adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or
    require us to incur significant costs. In addition, our
    customers generally impose very high quality and reliability
    standards on our products, which often change and may be
    difficult or costly to satisfy. Any inability to satisfy such
    customer quality standards or comply with industry standards and
    technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our
    products and our results of operations. In addition, our growth
    is dependent on our continued ability to identify and penetrate
    new markets where we have limited experience and competition is
    intense. There can be no assurance that the markets we serve
    will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will
    meet the requirements of these markets, that our products will
    achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors
    will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take
    market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain profits
    in these markets. Furthermore, a decline in demand in one or
    several of our end-user markets could have a material adverse
    effect on the demand for our products and our results of
    operations. Also, some of our customers in these markets are
    less established, which could subject us to increased credit
    risk.

We may
    not be able to compete successfully in markets within the
    semiconductor industry in the future.

Many other companies offer products that compete with our
    products. Some have greater financial, manufacturing, technical
    and marketing resources than we have. Some of our competitors
    may have better established supply or development relationships
    with our current and potential customers. Additionally, some
    formerly independent competitors have been purchased by larger
    companies. Our competitors also include emerging companies
    selling specialized products in markets we serve. Competition is
    based on design and quality of products, product performance,
    features and functionality, and price, with the relative
    importance of these factors varying among products, markets and
    customers. Existing or new competitors may develop products or
    technologies that more effectively address the demands of our
    customers and markets with enhanced features and functionality,
    lower power requirements, greater levels of integration or lower
    cost. Increased competition in certain markets has resulted in
    and may continue to result in declining average selling prices,
    reduced gross margins and loss of market share in such markets.
    There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete
    successfully in the future against existing or new competitors,
    or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by
    increased price competition.

We rely
    on third-party subcontractors and manufacturers for some
    industry-standard wafers and assembly and test services, and
    therefore cannot control their availability or conditions of
    supply.

We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on assembly and test
    subcontractors and on third-party wafer fabricators to supply
    most of our wafers that can be manufactured using
    industry-standard submicron processes. This reliance involves
    several risks, including reduced control over availability,
    capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields,
    quality assurance and costs. Additionally, we utilize a limited
    number of third-party wafer fabricators, primarily Taiwan
    Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. These suppliers manufacture
    components in accordance with our proprietary designs and
    specifications. We have no written supply agreements with these
    suppliers and purchase our custom components through individual
    purchase orders. In addition, these suppliers often provide
    manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods
    of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints.
    If these suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and
    deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time
    schedule and of the quality that we require, we may be forced to
    seek to



engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result
    in additional expenses and delays in product development or
    shipment of product to our customers.

We may
    not be able to satisfy increasing demand for our products, and
    increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower
    prices.

The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted
    in sustained and short-term periods when demand for our products
    has increased or decreased rapidly. During these periods of
    rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be
    sufficient to satisfy the available demand. In addition, we may
    not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a
    sufficiently timely manner, procure adequate resources, or
    locate suitable third-party suppliers, to respond effectively to
    changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for
    new products requested by our customers, and our current or
    future business could be materially and adversely affected.
    Conversely, if we expand our operations and workforce too
    rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of
    increased demand for our products, and such demand does not
    materialize at the pace at which we expect, our operating
    results may be adversely affected. These capacity expansions by
    us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to
    overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price
    erosion that would adversely impact our operating results.

Our
    revenue may not increase enough to offset the expense of
    additional capacity.

We, and the semiconductor industry generally, expand production
    facilities and access to third-party foundries in response to
    periods of increased demand which can cause operating expenses
    to increase. Should customer demand fail to increase or should
    we enter a period of reduced customer demand, our financial
    position and results of operations could be adversely impacted
    as a result of increased operating expenses, reduced margins,
    underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges.

Our
    semiconductor products are complex and may contain undetected
    defects which could result in significant costs, claims and
    damage to our reputation, and adversely affect the market
    acceptance of our products.

Semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain
    undetected defects when they are first introduced or as new
    versions are developed. We invest significant resources in the
    testing of our products; however, if any of our products contain
    defects, we may be required to incur additional development and
    remediation costs, pursuant to warranty and indemnification
    provisions in our customer contracts. These problems may divert
    our technical and other resources from other product development
    efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers
    or others, including liability for costs associated with product
    recalls. If any of our products contains defects, or has
    reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation
    may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to
    sell our products to existing and prospective customers and
    could adversely affect our operating results.

We may be
    unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which may
    limit our ability to compete effectively.

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our
    intellectual property. We primarily rely on patent, mask work,
    copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as
    nondisclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our
    proprietary technologies and processes. Despite our efforts to
    protect our proprietary technologies and processes, it is
    possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties
    may obtain, copy, use or disclose our technologies and
    processes. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we
    design, manufacture, market and sell our products may afford
    little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology.

There can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued
    patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In
    addition, any of our existing or future patents may be
    challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As such, any rights
    granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful
    protection. We may not have foreign patents or pending
    applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and
    applications. Even if foreign patents are granted, effective
    enforcement in foreign countries may not be available. If our
    patents do not adequately protect our technology, our
    competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours. Our
    competitors may also be able to



develop similar technology independently or design around our
    patents. Other companies or individuals have obtained patents
    covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and
    we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these
    patents or be precluded from making and selling the infringing
    products, if such patents are found to be valid. There can be no
    assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses, if required,
    upon commercially reasonable terms, or at all.

We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our
    employees, consultants and strategic partners. We also try to
    control access to and distribution of our technologies,
    documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these
    efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy,
    disclose, obtain or use our products, services or technology
    without our authorization. Also, former employees may seek
    employment with our business partners, customers or competitors,
    and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of
    our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of
    such future employment.

We are
    involved in frequent litigation, including regarding
    intellectual property rights, which could be costly to bring or
    defend and could require us to redesign products or pay
    significant royalties.

The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims
    and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property
    rights, including claims arising under our contractual
    obligations to indemnify our customers. We have received from
    time to time, and may receive in the future, claims from third
    parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their
    patents or other intellectual property rights. In the event a
    third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us
    and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable
    terms, or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to
    stop production of products incorporating that intellectual
    property, and our operating results could be materially and
    adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our
    patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to
    defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation
    could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel.
    We could be subject to warranty or product liability claims that
    could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend such
    claims or pay damage awards. While we maintain product liability
    insurance, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be
    available or adequate to protect against all such claims. We may
    incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of one of our
    customers’ products containing one of our products. See
    Note 12 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial
    Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for information concerning certain pending litigation that
    involves us. An adverse outcome in these matters or other
    litigation could have a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results
    of operations or cash flows in the period in which the
    litigation is resolved.

If we do
    not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our
    business strategy will be limited.

Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued
    service of our executive officers and key management and
    technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers, and
    on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate
    qualified personnel. The competition for these employees is
    intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key
    personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating
    results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect
    on our business should the turnover rates for engineers and
    other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable
    to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do not maintain
    any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or
    employees.

To remain
    competitive, we may need to acquire other companies or purchase
    or license technology from third parties in order to introduce
    new products and services or enhance our existing products and
    services.

An element of our business strategy involves expansion through
    the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies
    that allow us to complement our existing product offerings,
    expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce
    or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to
    find businesses that have the technology or resources we need
    and, if we find such businesses, may not be able to purchase or
    license the technology or resources on commercially favorable
    terms or at all. Acquisitions and technology licenses are
    difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons,
    including the cost of potential transactions, competition among
    prospective buyers and licensees and the need for regulatory
    approvals. In order to finance a potential transaction, we may
    need to raise additional funds by selling our stock or borrowing
    money. We may not be able to



find financing on favorable terms, and the sale of our stock may
    result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the
    issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the
    rights of our common stockholders. Acquisitions also involve a
    number of risks, including:

•

difficulty integrating acquired technologies, operations and
    personnel with our existing businesses;

•

diversion of management attention in connection with both
    negotiating the acquisitions and integrating the assets;

•

strain on managerial and operational resources as management
    tries to oversee larger operations;

•

the future funding requirements for acquired companies, which
    may be significant;

•

potential loss of key employees;

•

exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired
    companies; and

•

increased risk of costly and time-consuming litigation.

If we are unable to successfully address these risks, we may not
    realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition,
    which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of
    operations.

We rely
    on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable
    areas, which could affect the availability of supplies and
    services.

We, and many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on
    internal manufacturing capacity, wafer fabrication foundries and
    other sub-contractors in geologically unstable locations around
    the world. This reliance involves risks associated with the
    impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry,
    including temporary loss of capacity, availability and cost of
    key raw materials and equipment and availability of key services
    including transport of our products worldwide. Any prolonged
    inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities, or
    those of our subcontractors or third party wafer-fabrication
    foundries, as a result of fire, natural disaster, unavailability
    of electric power or otherwise, would have a material adverse
    effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

We are
    exposed to business, economic, political and other risks through
    our significant worldwide operations.

During fiscal 2007, approximately 74% of our product revenue was
    derived from customers in international markets. Although we
    engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to
    currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance
    that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by
    changes in the exchange rate of the United States dollar against
    other currencies. Potential interest rate increases, as well as
    high energy costs could have an adverse impact on industrial and
    consumer spending patterns and could adversely impact demand for
    our products. We have manufacturing facilities outside the
    United States in Ireland and the Philippines. In addition to
    being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the
    semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic and
    political risks inherent in international operations and their
    impact on the United States economy in general, including the
    risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and
    economic instability in many countries around the world as well
    as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism, and the
    response to them by the United States and its allies. Other
    business risks associated with international operations include
    increased managerial complexities, air transportation
    disruptions, expropriation, currency controls, currency exchange
    rate movement, additional costs related to foreign taxes,
    tariffs and freight rate increases, exposure to different
    business practices and legal standards, particularly with
    respect to price protection and intellectual property, trade and
    travel restrictions, pandemics, import and export license
    requirements and restrictions, difficulties in staffing and
    managing worldwide operations, and accounts receivable
    collections.

Our
    future operating results are dependent on the performance of
    independent distributors.

A significant portion of our sales are through independent
    distributors that are not under our control. These independent
    distributors generally represent product lines offered by
    several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts
    applied to our products or terminate their representation of us.
    We generally do not require letters of



credit from our distributors and are not protected against
    accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors.
    Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could
    adversely affect our results of operations. Termination of a
    significant distributor, whether at our initiative or the
    distributor’s initiative, could disrupt our current
    business. If we are unable to find suitable replacements in the
    event of terminations by significant distributors our operating
    results could be adversely affected.

We are
    subject to increasingly strict environmental regulations, which
    could increase our expenses and affect our operating
    results.

Our industry is subject to environmental regulations that
    control and restrict the use, transportation, emission,
    discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals used in the
    manufacturing process. Public attention on environmental
    controls has increased, and changes in environmental regulations
    might require us to invest in costly remediation equipment or
    alter the way our products are made. In addition, we use
    hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks
    of liability for damages caused by accidental releases,
    regardless of fault. Any failure to control such materials
    adequately or to comply with regulatory restrictions could
    increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results.

Our
    manufacturing processes are highly complex and may be
    interrupted.

We have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial
    amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits
    is a highly complex and precise process. Minute impurities,
    contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in
    the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer
    manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer
    breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of
    wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be
    nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in
    semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes
    could become unstable. This instability could result in
    manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial position or results of
    operations.

Our stock
    price may be volatile.

The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the
    past and may be volatile in the future, as it may be
    significantly affected by the following factors:

•

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating
    results;

•

changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our
    failure to perform in line with such estimates or our published
    guidance;

•

changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies;

•

announcements by us or our competitors of significant new
    products, technical innovations, acquisitions or dispositions,
    litigation or capital commitments;

•

departures of key personnel;

•

actual or perceived noncompliance with corporate responsibility
    or ethics standards by us or any of our employees, officers or
    directors; and

•

negative media publicity targeting us or our competitors.

The stock market has historically experienced volatility,
    especially within the semiconductor industry, that often has
    been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. These
    market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless
    of our operating results.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

Tentative
    Settlement of the SEC’s Previously Announced Stock Option
    Investigation

In our 2004

Form 10-K

filing, we disclosed that the Securities and Exchange
    Commission, or SEC, had initiated an inquiry into our stock
    option granting practices, focusing on options that were granted
    shortly before the issuance of favorable financial results. On
    November 15, 2005, we announced that we had reached a
    tentative settlement with the SEC.

At all times since receiving notice of this inquiry, we have
    cooperated with the SEC. In November 2005, we and our President
    and CEO, Mr. Jerald G. Fishman, made an offer of settlement
    to the Staff of the SEC. The settlement has been submitted to
    the Commission for approval. There can be no assurance a final
    settlement will be so approved.

The SEC’s inquiry focused on two separate issues. The
    first issue concerned our disclosure regarding grants of options
    to employees and directors prior to the release of favorable
    financial results. Specifically, the issue related to options
    granted to our employees

(

including officers

)

on
    November 30, 1999 and to our employees

(

including
    officers

)

and directors on November 10, 2000.

The second issue concerned the grant dates for options granted
    to employees

(

including officers

)

in 1998 and
    1999, and the grant date for options granted to employees
    (including officers

)

and directors in 2001. Specifically,
    the settlement would conclude that the appropriate grant date
    for the September 4, 1998 options should have been
    September 8th (which is one trading day later than the
    date that was used to price the options); the appropriate grant
    date for the November 30, 1999 options should have been
    November 29th (which is one trading day earlier than
    the date that was used); and the appropriate grant date for the
    July 18, 2001 options should have been
    July 26th (which is five trading days after the
    original date).

In connection with the proposed settlement, we would consent to
    a

cease-and-desist

order under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act
    and

Rule 10b-5

thereunder, would pay a civil money penalty of $3 million,
    and would reprice options granted to Mr. Fishman in certain
    years. Options granted to all others would be excluded from the
    repricing. Mr. Fishman would consent to a

cease-and-desist

order under Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the
    Securities Act, would pay a civil money penalty of
    $1 million, and would make a disgorgement payment with
    respect to options granted in certain years. With the exception
    of options granted in 1998, Mr. Fishman has not exercised
    or sold any of the options identified in this matter. We and
    Mr. Fishman would settle this matter without admitting or
    denying the Commission’s findings.

We have determined that no restatement of our historical
    financial results would be necessary due to the proposed
    settlement.

Other
    Legal Proceedings

In May 2006, we received a document subpoena from the
    U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York
    requesting records from 2000 to the present relating to our
    granting of stock options. We believe that the options at issue
    in this matter are the same option grants which have been the
    subject of investigation by the SEC. We have cooperated with the
    office of the U.S. Attorney in connection with this
    subpoena. We cannot predict the outcome of this matter, but
    believe the disposition of the matter will not have a material
    adverse effect on us or our financial position.

On May 25, 2006, we filed a lawsuit in United States
    District Court for the District of Delaware against Linear
    Technology Corp., or LTC, alleging infringement of three of our
    patents by LTC’s making, selling and using various
    products. In our complaint, we are seeking damages in an
    unspecified amount and injunctive relief. In addition, we also
    sought a declaratory judgment that our products do not infringe
    eight patents allegedly owned by LTC (the “LTC
    patents”) and that the LTC patents are invalid. On
    July 28, 2006, LTC filed an answer and counterclaims,
    denying that its products infringe the asserted patents and
    asking the court to declare such patents invalid. LTC also
    claimed that we, by making, selling and using various power
    management products, are infringing seven of the eight LTC
    patents. LTC seeks damages in an unspecified amount and
    injunctive relief. On August 21, 2006, we filed our answer
    to LTC’s counterclaims, denying all liability to LTC. The
    case is currently in the discovery phase and trial is



scheduled to begin in October 2008. We intend to vigorously
    pursue our claims against LTC, and to vigorously defend against
    LTC’s counterclaims. We are unable at this time to predict
    the outcome of this litigation; however, we believe that the
    final disposition of this matter will not have a material
    adverse effect on us or our financial position.

On October 13, 2006, a purported class action complaint was
    filed in the United States District Court for the District of
    Massachusetts on behalf of participants in our Investment
    Partnership Plan from October 5, 2000 to the present. The
    complaint named as defendants us, certain officers and
    directors, and our Investment Partnership Plan Administration
    Committee. The complaint alleges purported violations of federal
    law in connection with our option granting practices during the
    years 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001, including breaches of
    fiduciary duties owed to participants and beneficiaries of our
    Investment Partnership Plan under the Employee Retirement Income
    Security Act. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages,
    as well as equitable and injunctive relief. We intend to
    vigorously defend against these allegations. On
    November 22, 2006, we and the individual defendants filed
    motions to dismiss the complaint. On January 8, 2007, the
    Plaintiff filed memoranda in opposition. On January 22,
    2007, we and the individual defendants filed further memoranda
    in support of the motions to dismiss. Although we believe we
    have meritorious defenses to the asserted claims, we are unable
    at this time to predict the outcome of this proceeding. The
    court has scheduled a hearing on our motion to dismiss on
    January 30, 2008.

From time to time in the ordinary course of our business,
    various claims, charges and litigation are asserted or commenced
    against us arising from, or related to, contractual matters,
    patents, trademarks, personal injury, environmental matters,
    product liability, insurance coverage and personnel and
    employment disputes. As to such claims and litigation, we can
    give no assurance that we will prevail.

While we do not believe that any of the matters described above
    will have a material adverse effect on our financial position,
    an adverse outcome of any of these matters is possible and could
    have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of
    operations or cash flows in the quarter or annual period in
    which one or more of these matters are resolved.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS (all tabular amounts in thousands except per share
    amounts)

This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations, including in particular the
    section entitled “Outlook” contains forward-looking
    statements regarding future events and our future results that
    are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act
    of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). These
    statements are based on current expectations, estimates,
    forecasts, and projections about the industries in which we
    operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Words
    such as “expects,” “anticipates,”
    “targets,” “goals,” “projects,”
    “intends,” “plans,” “believes,”
    “seeks,” “estimates,” “continues,”
    “may,” variations of such words and similar
    expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking
    statements. In addition, any statements that refer to
    projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated
    growth and trends in our businesses, and other characterizations
    of future events or circumstances are forward-looking
    statements. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking
    statements are only predictions and are subject to risks,
    uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict,
    including those identified in Part I, Item 1A. Risk
    Factors and elsewhere in our Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely
    from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. We
    undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking
    statements for any reason.

In September 2007, we entered into a definitive agreement to
    sell our baseband chipset business and related support
    operations, or Baseband Chipset Business, to MediaTek Inc. We
    have reflected the financial results of this business as
    discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of income
    for all years presented. The assets and liabilities of this
    business are reflected as assets and liabilities of discontinued
    operations in the consolidated balance sheets as of
    November 3, 2007 and October 28, 2006. Unless
    otherwise noted, this Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    relates only to financial results from continuing operations.

.

Revenue
    Trends by End Market

The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using
    a variety of data points including the technical characteristics
    of the product, the “sold to” customer information,
    the “ship to” customer information and the end
    customer product or application into which our product will be
    incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this
    data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end
    market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify
    revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications
    typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the
    underlying trends of results within, each end market.

Industrial —

The year-to-year increase from
    fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of revenue
    growth in products sold into the automotive area and to a lesser
    extent the instrumentation portion of the industrial end market.
    These sales increases were partially offset by a decline in
    sales to automatic test equipment customers. The year-to-year
    increase from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 was a result of a broad
    based increase in demand for our products across a wide range of
    customers in this end market.

Communications —

The year-to-year increase from
    fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was the result of an increase in
    sales to customers in the wireless basestation and analog
    wireless handset end markets. The increase in sales in these end
    markets was partially offset by a decrease in sales to
    networking customers. The year-to-year increase from fiscal 2005
    to fiscal 2006 was the result of an increase in sales of our
    products sold to customers in the wireless basestation end
    market and to a lesser extent, an increase in sales of our
    products sold into optical applications. These increases were
    offset by a decrease in sales to networking customers as a
    result of the sale of our DSP-based DSL ASIC and network
    processor product line, which we sold in the second quarter of
    fiscal 2006.

Consumer —

The year-to-year increase from
    fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of increased
    sales of our products used in video game applications, advanced
    television systems and digital home applications. The
    year-to-year increase from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 was
    primarily the result of the success of our products in digital
    home applications and advanced television systems and to a
    lesser extent in a broad array of audio and video applications.

Computer —

The year-to-year decreases in each
    of the last two fiscal years was the result of our decision to
    deemphasize power management products used in desktop and laptop
    computers.

Revenue from One-Time IP License —

During the
    first quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded revenue of
    $35 million received in exchange for licensing of certain
    intellectual property rights to a third party.

Revenue
    Trends by Product

The following table summarizes revenue by product categories.
    The categorization of our products into broad categories is
    based on the characteristics of the individual products, the
    specification of the products and in some cases the specific
    uses that certain products have within applications. The
    categorization of products into categories is therefore subject
    to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances
    where products move between



product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product
    categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications
    typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the
    underlying trends of results within, each product category.

The significant changes in our revenue trends by product type
    from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2006, and from fiscal 2006 to fiscal
    2005, were the year-to-year increases in our other analog
    product category, primarily as a result of increased sales of
    products used in video game applications and continued growth in
    converters and amplifiers. Sales of products in the power
    management and reference product category were lower in fiscal
    2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 as a result of our decision to
    deemphasize power management products used in desktop and laptop
    computers. The year-to-year declines from fiscal 2006 to fiscal
    2007, and from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006, in the DSP product
    category were primarily attributable to the loss of revenue from
    our DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product line that
    we sold in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. These decreases
    were partially offset by an increase in revenues from our
    general purpose DSP products.

Gross margin in fiscal 2007 decreased by 20 basis points
    from the gross margin recorded in fiscal 2006. This decrease was
    primarily the result of higher sales of products used in
    consumer electronics, which currently earn relatively lower
    gross margins than our average gross margin. This decrease was
    partially offset by the $35 million in revenue recorded in
    the first quarter of fiscal 2007 in exchange for licensing of
    certain intellectual property rights to a third party with no
    associated cost of sales. Fiscal year 2006 cost of sales also
    included approximately $20.3 million of
    restructuring-related expenses, of which $18.3 million was
    accelerated depreciation.

Gross margin in fiscal 2006 decreased by 10 basis points
    from the gross margin recorded in fiscal 2005. This decrease was
    the result of recognizing $29.3 million of stock-based
    compensation expense, restructuring-related and
    acquisition-related expenses in cost of sales in fiscal 2006.
    The restructuring expense primarily related to accelerated
    depreciation of $18.3 million. These increases in expenses
    were partially offset by an increase in utilization of our wafer
    fabrication facilities and increased sales of higher margin
    products during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005.

Stock-based
    Compensation Expense

During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, on October 30,
    2005, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
    (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment,

or SFAS 123R,
    using the modified prospective application method. Compensation
    cost is calculated on the date of grant using the fair value of
    the options as calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing
    model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires us to
    make several assumptions. One of the key assumptions is expected
    volatility. For options granted prior to fiscal 2005, we used
    historical volatility to estimate the grant-date fair value of
    stock options. We changed our method of estimating expected
    volatility for all stock options granted after fiscal 2004 from
    exclusively relying on historical volatility to exclusively
    relying on implied volatility. This change was the result of a
    thorough review we undertook, which included consultations with
    several third-party advisors. We currently believe that the
    exclusive use of implied volatility results in a more accurate
    estimate of the grant-date fair value of employee stock options
    because it more appropriately reflects the market’s current
    expectations of future volatility. Historical volatility during
    the period commensurate with the expected term of our stock
    options over the past several years included a period of time
    during which our stock price experienced unprecedented increases
    and subsequent declines. We believe that this past stock price
    volatility is unlikely to be indicative of future stock price
    behavior.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we accounted for
    share-based payments to employees under APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, using the
    intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognized no
    compensation cost for employee stock options. The adoption of
    SFAS 123R under the modified prospective application method
    allowed us to recognize compensation cost beginning with the
    effective date (a) based on the requirement of
    SFAS 123R for all share-based payments granted after the
    effective date and (b) based on the requirements of
    SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the
    effective date of SFAS 123R that were unvested on the
    effective date. Under the modified prospective application
    method, prior periods are not restated for the effect of
    SFAS 123R. We used the graded attribution method to
    recognize expense for all options granted prior to the adoption
    of SFAS 123R. Upon adoption of SFAS 123R on
    October 30, 2005, we switched to the straight-line
    attribution method to recognize expense for all grants made
    after October 29, 2005. The expense associated with the
    unvested portion of the pre-adoption grants continues to be
    expensed using the graded attribution method.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R on October 18,
    2005, we accelerated the vesting of all unvested stock options
    awarded to employees after December 31, 2000 that had
    exercise prices of $40.00 per share or greater. The vesting of
    options issued to our corporate officers and directors was not
    accelerated. Unvested options to purchase approximately
    18 million shares became exercisable as a result of the
    vesting acceleration. Because the exercise



price of all the modified options was greater than the market
    price of our underlying common stock on the date of the
    modification, no stock-based compensation expense was recorded
    in the statement of income in accordance with APB Opinion
    No. 25. The primary purpose for modifying the terms of
    these out-of-the-money stock options to accelerate their vesting
    was to eliminate the need to recognize the remaining
    unrecognized non-cash compensation expense in our statement of
    income associated with these stock options as measured under
    SFAS 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

,
    because the approximately $188 million ($134 million
    net of tax) of future expense associated with these options
    would have been disproportionately high compared to the economic
    value of the options at the date of modification.

Our income from continuing operations before income taxes and
    net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2007, are
    $67.0 million and $47.3 million lower, respectively,
    than if we had continued to account for share-based compensation
    under APB Opinion 25. Basic and diluted earnings per share for
    fiscal 2007 were $0.15 and $0.14 lower, respectively, than if we
    had continued to account for share-based compensation under APB
    Opinion 25. We expect that stock-based compensation related to
    our adoption of SFAS 123R will reduce diluted EPS by
    approximately $0.03 in the first quarter of fiscal 2008.

Our income from continuing operations before income taxes and
    net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2006, were
    $69.8 million and $49.7 million lower, respectively,
    than if we had continued to account for share-based compensation
    under APB Opinion 25. Basic and diluted earnings per share for
    fiscal 2006 were $0.14 and $0.13 lower, respectively, than if we
    had continued to account for share-based compensation under APB
    Opinion 25.

As of November 3, 2007, the total compensation cost related
    to unvested awards not yet recognized in the statement of income
    was approximately $144.5 million (before tax
    consideration), which will be recognized over a weighted average
    period of 1.7 years.

    contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

R&D expenses for fiscal 2007 increased by
    $49.9 million, or 11%, from the amount recorded in fiscal
    2006. The increase in R&D expense was primarily the result
    of an increase in employee salary and benefit expense in fiscal
    2007, primarily as a result of an increase in our employee
    population and to a lesser extent the impact of the extra week
    of operations in fiscal 2007. These increases were partially
    offset by lower employee bonus expense during fiscal 2007 as
    compared to fiscal 2006.

R&D expenses for fiscal 2006 increased by
    $31.2 million, or 7%, from the amount recorded in fiscal
    2005. The increase in R&D expense in fiscal 2006 was
    primarily the result of recognizing $29.6 million of
    stock-based compensation expense due to the adoption of
    SFAS 123R and an increase in employee bonus expense. These
    increases were partially offset by the savings realized from the
    restructuring actions we initiated in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2005 and the sale of our DSP-based DSL ASIC and network
    processor product line in the second quarter of fiscal 2006.

R&D expense as a percentage of net sales will fluctuate
    from year-to-year depending on the amount of net sales and the
    success of new product development efforts, which we view as
    critical to our future growth. At any point in time we have
    hundreds of R&D projects underway, and we believe that none
    of these projects is material on an individual basis. We expect
    to continue the development of innovative technologies and
    processes for new products, and we believe that a continued
    commitment to R&D is essential in order to maintain product
    leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative
    new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to
    make significant R&D investments in the future.

SMG&A expenses for fiscal 2007 increased by

    result of higher employee salary and benefit expense and an
    extra week of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2007.
    These increases were partially offset by lower employee bonus
    expense and $8.5 million related to the reimbursement of
    legal expenses we received as a result of the settlement of
    litigation in the second quarter of fiscal 2007.

SMG&A expenses for fiscal 2006 increased by
    $54.8 million, or 16%, from the levels recorded in fiscal
    2005. The increase in SMG&A expenses was primarily the
    result of recording $32.6 million of stock-based
    compensation expense related to the adoption of SFAS 123R
    and higher employee salary, benefit and bonus expenses. These
    increases were partially offset by savings realized from the
    restructuring actions we initiated in the fourth quarter of

    in fiscal 2007 or 2005. See “Acquisitions” below for
    additional information regarding these acquisitions.

Special
    Charges

Closure
    of Wafer Fabrication Facility in Sunnyvale

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we recorded a special
    charge of $20.3 million as a result of a decision to close
    our California wafer fabrication operations and transfer
    virtually all of the production of products manufactured there
    to our facility in Wilmington, Massachusetts. The charge was for
    severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant
    to SFAS 88,

Employers’ Accounting for Settlements
    and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for
    Termination Benefits

, or SFAS 88, under our ongoing
    benefit plan for 339 manufacturing employees and 28 general and
    administrative employees. The severance benefit was calculated
    based on length of past service, and employees had to continue
    to be employed until they were involuntarily terminated in order
    to receive the severance benefit. We completed the final cleanup
    and closure activities associated with this action during the
    second quarter of fiscal 2007.

In addition to the charge recorded in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2005, we recorded additional expense during fiscal 2006,
    which consisted of $18.3 million of non-cash cost of sales
    expenses for additional depreciation due to shortened useful
    lives of certain manufacturing equipment and $2.0 million
    for stay-on bonuses. We reversed approximately $2.0 million
    of our severance accrual during fiscal 2006 because some
    employees voluntarily left the company, other employees found
    alternative employment within the company, and there was an over
    accrual related to fringe benefits because severance payments,
    normally paid as income continuance, were paid in lump sum
    payments, which reduced the benefit costs associated with these
    payments. We have terminated the employment of all of the
    remaining employees included in this action.



We ceased production at the wafer fabrication facility on
    November 9, 2006. During the first quarter of fiscal 2007,
    we recorded additional expense, in accordance with
    SFAS 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
    Disposal Activities,

which consisted of $3.2 million
    for

clean-up

and closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred and
    $0.4 million for lease obligation costs for a warehouse
    facility we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal
    2007. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a
    special charge, in accordance with SFAS 146, which included
    $5.0 million of expense for future lease obligation costs
    for the wafer fabrication facility that we ceased using during
    the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Also included in this special
    charge was $1.7 million for

clean-up

and
    closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred. The

clean-up

activity was completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2007,
    and we do not expect to incur any additional charges related to
    this action.

The closure of this facility has resulted in annual cost savings
    of approximately $50 million per year beginning in fiscal
    2007. These annual savings include: approximately
    $49 million in cost of sales, of which approximately
    $7 million relates to non-cash depreciation savings, and
    approximately $1 million in SMG&A expenses. At current
    demand levels, if this facility were still in operation, the
    capacity of the facility would be largely underutilized
    resulting in significant adverse manufacturing variances
    associated with the underutilization of our wafer fabrication
    facilities.

Reorganization
    of Product Development and Support Programs

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we recorded a special
    charge of $11.2 million as a result of our decision to
    reorganize our product development and support programs with the
    goal of providing greater focus on our analog and digital signal
    processing product programs. The charge was for severance and
    fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to SFAS 88
    under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at
    foreign locations for 60 manufacturing employees and 154
    engineering and selling, marketing, general and administrative
    employees.

During fiscal 2006, we recorded an additional special charge of
    $3.8 million related to this reorganization action.
    Approximately $1.5 million of this charge was for lease
    obligation costs for a facility we ceased using during the first
    quarter of fiscal 2006 and the write-off of property, plant and
    equipment and other items at this facility. The remaining
    $2.3 million related to the severance and fringe benefit
    costs that were recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006
    pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or
    statutory requirements at foreign locations for 46 engineering
    and selling, marketing, general and administrative employees.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded an
    additional special charge of $1.6 million related to this
    reorganization action. Approximately $0.6 million of this
    charge was for contract termination costs. The remaining
    $1.0 million relates to severance and fringe benefit costs
    recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan
    for six engineering employees.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded an
    additional special charge of $3.4 million related to this
    reorganization action. Approximately $3.2 million relates
    to the severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to
    SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan or minimum statutory
    requirements at foreign locations for 20 engineering and
    selling, marketing, general and administrative employees. The
    remaining $0.2 million of this charge was for lease
    obligation costs for a facility we ceased using during the
    second quarter of fiscal 2007.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we reversed
    approximately $0.9 million of our severance accrual because
    some employees voluntarily left the company and other employees
    found alternative employment within the company, and were
    therefore no longer entitled to severance payments.

The employment of all employees included in this action has been
    terminated. We do not expect to incur any further charges
    related to this reorganization action. These organizational
    changes, which were fully implemented in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2007, are expected to result in savings of approximately
    $30 million per year. These savings are expected to be
    realized as follows: approximately $17 million in R&D
    expenses, approximately $10 million in SMG&A expenses
    and approximately $3 million in cost of sales. A portion of
    these savings associated with these charges is reflected in our
    fiscal 2007 results.



Fourth
    Quarter of Fiscal 2007 Special Charges

Consolidation
    of a Wafer Fabrication Facility in Limerick

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a special
    charge of $13.7 million as a result of our decision to
    focus the wafer fabrication capacity at our Limerick facility on
    eight-inch technology. Certain manufacturing processes and
    products produced on our six-inch production line will
    transition to our existing eight-inch production line in
    Limerick while others will transition to external foundries. The
    charge is for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded
    pursuant to SFAS 88 under our ongoing benefit plan for 150
    manufacturing employees. Production is expected to cease in the
    six-inch wafer fabrication facility during the first half of
    2009, and the affected employees will be terminated. These
    employees must continue to be employed until their employment is
    involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance
    benefit. We expect to incur additional expenses related to this
    action during fiscal year 2009 of approximately $6 million
    related to cleanup and closure costs. In accordance with
    SFAS 146, these costs will be expensed as incurred. The
    closure of this facility is estimated to result in annual cost
    savings of approximately $25 million per year, expected to
    start during the second quarter of fiscal 2009. These annual
    savings will be in cost of sales, of which approximately
    $1 million relates to non-cash depreciation savings.

Reduction
    of Overhead Infrastructure Costs

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we decided to either
    deemphasize or exit certain businesses or products and focus
    investments in products and end markets where we have better
    opportunities for profitable growth. In September 2007, we
    entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Baseband Chipset
    Business. As a result of these decisions, we decided to reduce
    the support infrastructure in manufacturing, engineering and
    SMG&A to more appropriately reflect our required overhead
    structure. Consequently, we recorded a special charge of
    $12.3 million, of which $10.7 million is for severance
    and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under
    our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign
    locations for 25 manufacturing employees and 127 engineering and
    selling, marketing, general and administrative employees. The
    remaining $1.6 million is for contract termination costs
    related to a license agreement associated with products we will
    no longer develop and for which there is no future alternative
    use. As of November 3, 2007, 77 of the 152 employees
    included in this cost reduction action were still employed by
    us. These employees must continue to be employed until their
    employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the
    severance benefit. These cost reduction actions are expected to
    result in savings of approximately $15 million per year
    once substantially completed in the second quarter of fiscal
    2008. These savings are expected to be realized as follows:
    approximately $7 million in R&D expenses,
    approximately $6 million in SMG&A expenses and
    approximately $2 million in cost of sales.

Operating income increased by $43.8 million, or 8%, in
    fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. This increase was the
    result of a $203.2 million increase in revenue, which was
    offset by a 0.2% reduction in gross margin percentage and a
    $72.3 million increase in operating expenses as more fully
    described above under the headings

The $43.8 million, or 9%, increase in operating income in
    fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily the result
    of a 10% increase in revenue. This increase was partially offset
    by $69.8 million of stock-based operating expenses
    associated with the adoption of SFAS 123R and the
    $21.7 million write-off of purchased in-process research
    and development as a result of our fiscal 2006 acquisitions. In
    addition, the special charges in fiscal 2006 were lower by
    $29.7 million than the special charges recorded in fiscal
    2005.

The $17.9 million decrease in nonoperating income in fiscal
    2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was a result of lower invested
    cash balances that were partially offset by the higher interest
    rates in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. This decrease
    in interest income was partially offset by a $7.9 million
    gain from the sale of an investment and a $10.5 million
    settlement we received in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2006, we also
    recognized a $13.0 million gain on the sale of our
    DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product line.

Nonoperating income increased by $38.9 million in fiscal
    2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily the
    result of higher interest income, which was primarily
    attributable to higher interest rates in fiscal 2006 as compared
    to fiscal 2005. Nonoperating income for fiscal 2006 also
    included a $13.0 million gain on the sale of our DSP-based
    DSL ASIC and network processor product line during the second
    quarter of fiscal 2006.

Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in
    effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where
    our income is earned. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 was
    higher by 550 basis points compared to our effective tax
    rate for fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily attributable
    to the recording of tax benefits of $35.2 million
    associated with the completion of an Internal Revenue Service,
    or IRS, examination during fiscal 2006, including the reversal
    of penalty accruals and the filing of refund claims in other
    jurisdictions associated with the completion of the IRS audit.
    The increase was also attributable to the following fiscal 2007
    transactions, which were taxed at the higher U.S. tax rate:
    the one-time receipt of $35 million associated with the
    licensing of intellectual property to a third party, the gain on
    the sale of an investment of $7.9 million and the
    $19 million received from the settlement of litigation. In
    addition, we recorded an additional $4.4 million of taxes
    and penalties in fiscal 2007 for proposed adjustments related to
    the IRS examination of fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 and a
    $5.6 million tax adjustment related to the finalization of
    the accounting associated with a fiscal 2006 acquisition. These
    items were partially offset by a tax benefit of
    $4.7 million from the reinstatement of the
    U.S. federal research and development tax credit in fiscal
    2007 and a $9.9 million cumulative adjustment recorded in
    fiscal 2007 related to the application of this credit to a
    portion of our fiscal 2006 results.

The tax rate was lower in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005
    primarily due to the recording of tax benefits of
    $35.2 million associated with the completion of an IRS
    examination during fiscal 2006, including the reversal of
    penalty accruals and the filing of refund claims in other
    jurisdictions associated with the completion of the IRS audit.
    In addition, the effective tax rate was higher in fiscal 2005 as
    a result of our repatriation of foreign earnings and the
    write-off of deferred tax assets associated with balances
    accumulated in our deferred compensation plan as more fully
    described below.

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of
    2004, or the AJCA, was signed into law. The AJCA created a
    temporary incentive for U.S. multinational corporations to
    repatriate accumulated foreign income by providing an 85%
    dividends received deduction for certain dividends from
    controlled foreign corporations. During fiscal 2005, we
    repatriated $1,055 million of accumulated foreign earnings,
    taking the benefit of current tax law allowing for earnings
    repatriated prior to October 29, 2005 to be taxed at a
    reduced effective tax rate. In connection with the repatriation
    of earnings, we recorded additional income tax expense of
    $49 million in fiscal 2005.



We had originally established a deferred tax asset on our
    consolidated balance sheet with the expectation that the
    officers subject to the 162(m) limitation of the Internal
    Revenue Code would not withdraw their balances from the Analog
    Devices, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, or the deferred
    compensation plan, while they were still subject to the 162(m)
    limitation, and we would receive a tax deduction at the time of
    withdrawal, generally upon their retirement. Due to changes in
    tax law during 2005 that were enacted as part of the AJCA, the
    laws associated with distributions from deferred compensation
    plans changed. In fiscal 2005 three executive officers who were
    subject to the 162(m) limitation withdrew, or indicated their
    intention to withdraw a portion of their balances from the
    deferred compensation plan. As a result, we incurred additional
    income tax expense in fiscal 2005 of $7.2 million due to
    the write-off of deferred tax assets associated with balances
    accumulated in the deferred compensation plan.

Net income from continuing operations was lower in fiscal 2007
    than in fiscal 2006 by approximately $15.6 million
    primarily as a result of the $17.9 million decrease in
    nonoperating income and the impact of a higher effective income
    tax rate in fiscal 2007, partially offset by the
    $43.8 million increase in operating income from continuing
    operations.

Net income from continuing operations increased by
    $140.4 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005,
    primarily as the result of the 10% increase in revenue, the
    increase in nonoperating income and lower tax expense. This
    increase in net income was partially offset by a year-to-year
    increase in operating expenses of $78.0 million, primarily
    as a result of $62.2 million of stock-based operating
    expenses related to the adoption of SFAS 123R and
    $22.2 million of operating expenses related to our
    acquisitions during fiscal 2006. These operating expense
    increases were partially offset by a $29.7 million decrease
    in special charges in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005.

The impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate
    movement on our business during the past three fiscal years has
    not been significant.

We entered into a definitive agreement in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2007 to sell our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek
    Inc. Accordingly, these operations have been presented as a
    discontinued operation within the consolidated financial
    statements in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or
    Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (SFAS 144)

. We expect to
    record a gain from the sale of this business upon the completion
    of the sale in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. We estimate
    this gain after taxes will be in the range of $150 million
    to $160 million.

Acquisitions

In the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we completed a transaction
    with TTPCom Limited (TTPCom), whereby TTPCom transferred to us
    intellectual property, engineering resources, and related assets
    associated with the support and customization of TTPCom’s
    GSM/GPRS/EDGE modem software for use on our existing and future
    generations of
    SoftFone

®

baseband processors. We also acquired development rights for
    AJAR, TTPCom’s advanced applications platform. As a result
    of this transaction, we became the single point of contact for
    both hardware and software support for our new and existing
    wireless handset customers, thus improving our abilities to



service the needs of individual customers. We paid TTPCom
    $11.9 million in initial cash payments. The purchase price
    was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired
    based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.
    The estimated fair values of the assets exceeded the initial
    payments by $7.8 million, resulting in negative goodwill.
    Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
    No 141,

Business Combinations,

we recorded a liability
    for the contingent consideration that will be accounted for as
    additional purchase price, up to the amount of the negative
    goodwill. As contingent payments became due, the payments were
    applied against the contingent liability. As of October 28,
    2006, we had paid $6 million of contingent payments and the
    remaining contingent liability was $1.8 million. The
    purchase price included $5.5 million of in-process
    technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility,
    had no alternative future use and was charged to operations
    during the third quarter of fiscal 2006. The in-process
    technology related to software code developed for use in our
    semiconductor chipsets manufactured for devices that use both
    the 2G and 2.5G cellular wireless technology standards. The fair
    value of the in-process technology was determined with the
    assistance of a third party using the income approach. At the
    time of the acquisition, the in-process technology was
    approximately 56% complete. As of November 3, 2007, the
    in-process research and development projects were complete.
    During fiscal 2007, we paid an additional $6.1 million of
    contingent consideration, which resulted in reducing the
    $1.8 million liability and recording additional goodwill of
    $4.3 million. As of November 3, 2007, all
    technological milestones have been met and no additional
    payments will be made. The acquisition also included
    $13.2 million of intangible assets that were being
    amortized over their estimated useful lives of five years using
    an accelerated amortization method that reflects the estimated
    pattern of economic use. As a result of the definitive agreement
    to sell our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc.,
    $7.9 million and $11.4 million of net intangible
    assets were reclassified to assets of discontinued operations at
    November 3, 2007 and October 28, 2006, respectively,
    as the TTPCom assets will be transferred to Media Tek Inc. as
    part of the transaction. See Note 2u. to our Consolidated
    Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

for further information regarding assets of discontinued
    operations.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we acquired substantially
    all the outstanding stock of privately-held Integrant
    Technologies, Inc. (Integrant) of Seoul, Korea. The acquisition
    enabled us to enter the mobile TV market and strengthened our
    presence in the Asian region. We paid $127.2 million in
    initial cash payments at closing and may be obligated to make
    additional cash payments of up to an aggregate of
    $33 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions.
    The initial cash payments included $4.2 million held in
    escrow for the purchase of the remaining non-founder outstanding
    shares. These shares were purchased during fiscal 2007 and were
    recorded as additional goodwill. The purchase price was
    allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based
    on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. We
    completed the final purchase accounting for this transaction
    during the first quarter of fiscal 2007, which resulted in an
    additional $5.6 million of goodwill. The $33 million
    of potential cash payments is comprised of $25 million for
    the achievement of revenue-based milestones that may be payable
    during the period from July 2006 through December 2007 and
    $8 million related to the purchase of shares from the
    founder of Integrant during the period from July 2007 through
    July 2009. The additional cash payments will be recorded as
    additional purchase price. During fiscal 2007, we paid
    $3.5 million to repurchase founder shares. No revenue-based
    milestones have been met as of November 3, 2007. The
    purchase price included $11.1 million of in-process
    technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility,
    had no alternative future use and was charged to operations
    during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The in-process
    technology related to technologies currently in development for
    Dual DAB, T-DMB, DVB-H, RFID and WiBro applications.
    The fair value of the in-process technology was determined with
    the assistance of a third party using the income approach. At
    the time of the acquisition, the in-process technology was
    approximately 74% complete. As of November 3, 2007, the
    in-process research and development projects were complete. The
    acquisition also included $21.6 million of intangible
    assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful
    lives of two to five years using an accelerated amortization
    method that reflects the estimated pattern of economic use.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we acquired all the
    outstanding stock of privately-held AudioAsics A/S (AudioAsics)
    of Roskilde, Denmark. The acquisition of AudioAsics allows us to
    continue developing our low-power audio solutions, while
    expanding our presence in the Nordic and Eastern European
    regions. We paid $19.3 million in initial cash payments at
    closing and may be obligated to make additional cash payments of
    up to an aggregate of $8 million upon the satisfaction of
    certain conditions. The purchase price was allocated to the
    tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated
    fair values at the date of acquisition. The $8 million of
    potential cash payments is comprised of $4.8 million for
    the achievement of revenue-based milestones that may be



payable during the period from October 2006 through January 2009
    and $3.2 million based on the achievement of technological
    milestones during the period from October 2006 through January
    2009. In order to be entitled to receive $2.4 million of
    the revenue-based contingent consideration, certain key
    employees must continue to be employed by us. As such, that
    portion of the revenue-based contingent consideration will be
    recorded as compensation expense when, and if, it is earned. The
    technological milestones require post-acquisition services to be
    rendered in order to be achieved and, as such, will be recorded
    as compensation expense when earned. The purchase price included
    $5.1 million of in-process technology that had not yet
    reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use
    and was charged to operations during the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2006. The in-process technology related to technologies
    currently in development for analog and digital microphone

pre-amplifiers.

The fair value of the in-process technology was determined with
    the assistance of a third party using the income approach. At
    the time of the acquisition, the in-process technology was
    approximately 69% complete. As of November 3, 2007, the
    in-process research and development projects were complete. The
    acquisition also included $8.3 million of intangible assets
    that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of
    five years using an accelerated amortization method that
    reflects the estimated pattern of economic use. As of
    November 3, 2007, no contingent consideration has been paid.

Pro forma results of operations for TTPCom, Integrant and
    AudioAsics have not been provided herein as they were not
    material to us on either an individual or an aggregate basis.
    The results of operations of each acquisition are included in
    our consolidated statement of income from the date of such
    acquisition.

Related
    Party Transaction

One of our directors, who has served on our Board of Directors
    since 1988, became a director of Taiwan Semiconductor
    Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, in fiscal 2002 and continues to
    serve as a director of TSMC. Management believes the terms and
    prices for the purchases of products from TSMC are not affected
    by the presence of one of our directors on the Board of
    Directors of TSMC. We purchased approximately $302 million,
    $281 million and $224 million of products from TSMC in
    fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Approximately
    $47 million and $17 million were payable to TSMC as of
    November 3, 2007 and October 28, 2006, respectively.
    We anticipate that we will make significant purchases from TSMC
    in fiscal year 2008.

    net cash generated from operating activities of
    $820.4 million and proceeds of $109.1 million from our
    employee stock plans. The principal uses of funds during fiscal
    2007 were the repurchase of approximately 45.9 million
    shares of our common stock for an aggregate of
    $1,647.2 million, dividend payments of $228.3 million
    and capital expenditures of $141.8 million.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we entered into a
    definitive agreement to sell our Baseband Chipset Business to
    MediaTek Inc. The cash flows from this discontinued operation
    have been combined with the operating, investing and financing
    cash flows from continuing operations (i.e. no separate
    classification of cash flows from discontinued operations) for
    all periods presented. We believe the absence of the cash flows
    from this discontinued operation will not have a material impact
    on our future liquidity and financial position. Additionally, as
    a result of this agreement, we reclassified certain assets and
    liabilities related to this business to assets or liabilities of
    discontinued operations. See Note 2u. to our Consolidated
    Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

for further information regarding this discontinued operation.

The anticipated closure of the sale of our Baseband Chipset
    Business to MediaTek Inc. and the anticipated closure of the
    sale of our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring
    business to ON Semiconductor



Corporation are expected to generate approximately
    $250 million to $270 million of cash in fiscal 2008
    after the payment of all applicable taxes.

    month of fiscal 2007 as compared to the last month of fiscal
    2006.

Inventories at the end of fiscal 2007 decreased by
    $15.4 million, or 4%, from the amount at the end of fiscal
    2006 and days cost of sales in inventory at the end of fiscal
    2007 decreased by 15 days from the amount at the end of
    fiscal 2006. The decrease in inventory is a result of our
    continued effort to balance production, demand and inventory
    levels as well as the sale of inventory (valued at approximately
    $19 million at October 28, 2006) which had been
    built during fiscal 2006 in anticipation of the closure of the
    Sunnyvale, California wafer fabrication facility.

Current liabilities increased to $548.1 million at
    November 3, 2007, an increase of $57.2 million, or
    11.6%, from $490.9 million at the end of fiscal 2006.

Net additions to property, plant and equipment including that
    related to our Baseband Chipset Business, which is reflected as
    a discontinued operation, were $141.8 million in fiscal
    2007, $129.3 million in fiscal 2006 and $85.5 million
    in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2008 capital expenditures are expected to
    total approximately $160 million.

During fiscal 2007, our Board of Directors declared cash
    dividends totaling $0.70 per outstanding share of common stock
    resulting in dividend payments of $228.3 million in fiscal
    2007. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on
    several factors including our financial performance, outlook and
    liquidity. After the end of the fiscal year, on
    November 26, 2007, our Board of Directors declared a cash
    dividend of $0.18 per outstanding share of our common stock. The
    dividend is payable on December 26, 2007 to shareholders of
    record on December 7, 2007 and is expected to total
    approximately $54 million.

On May 11, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized an
    increase in the aggregate dollar amount of common stock that may
    be repurchased under our share repurchase program previously
    adopted by our Board of Directors on August 11, 2004 from
    $500 million to $1 billion. On March 14, 2006,
    our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by us of an
    additional $1 billion of our common stock, increasing the
    total amount of our common stock we can repurchase from
    $1 billion to $2 billion of our common stock. On
    December 6, 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase by us of an additional $1 billion of our common
    stock, increasing the total amount of our common stock we are
    authorized to repurchase from $2 billion to
    $3 billion. On June 6, 2007, our Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase by us of an additional $1 billion
    of our common stock, increasing the total amount of our common
    stock we are authorized to repurchase from $3 billion to
    $4 billion. Under the repurchase program, we may repurchase
    outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the
    open market and through privately negotiated transactions.
    Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of
    Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have
    repurchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the
    repurchase program. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased
    approximately $1,647.2 million of our common stock under
    this plan. As of November 3, 2007, we had
    $665.2 million of authorized repurchases remaining under
    our repurchase program. We plan to continue to repurchase shares
    during fiscal 2008. The timing and number of shares repurchased
    can not be reasonably estimated at this time; however, from the
    end of fiscal year 2007 through November 26, 2007, we
    repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares for
    approximately $151 million.

Purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other
    goods and services are not included in the table above. We are
    not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders
    that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may
    represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding
    agreements. In addition, our purchase orders generally allow for
    cancellation without significant penalties. We do not have
    significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or
    other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that
    exceed our expected short-term requirements.

The expected timing of payments and the amounts of the
    obligations discussed above are estimated based on current
    information.

At November 3, 2007, our principal source of liquidity was
    $1,081.2 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity
    and cash expected to be generated from future operations,
    together with anticipated available long-term financing, will be
    sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures and research
    and development efforts for at least the next twelve months and
    thereafter for the foreseeable future.

Off-balance
    Sheet Financing

As of November 3, 2007, we had no off-balance sheet
    financing arrangements.

Outlook

The following statements are based on current expectations.
    These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may
    differ materially. Unless specifically mentioned, these
    statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any
    mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or business combinations
    that may be announced or closed after the date of filing this
    report. These statements supersede all prior statements
    regarding business outlook made by the Company. Upon entering
    into the definitive agreement to sell our CPU Voltage regulator
    and PC thermal monitoring



business on November 8, 2007, the assets of this business
    met the held-for-sale criteria, and will therefore be
    reclassified as discontinued operations during the first quarter
    of fiscal 2008. This business generated approximately
    $25 million of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.
    Therefore, once we reclassify the $25 million of revenue to
    discontinued operations, our fourth quarter revenue will be
    $623 million. On this basis, we expect product sales from
    continuing operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 to be
    approximately $610 million to $635 million. Gross
    margin percentage is planned to be up slightly in the first
    quarter of fiscal 2008 as compared to the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2007. Diluted EPS is planned to be approximately $0.38 to
    $0.42 for the first quarter of fiscal 2008.

As previously announced, we also expect to close on the sales of
    two businesses in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The
    estimated gains on these sales are not reflected in the
    estimates above. We expect to realize a gain, net of tax, of
    between approximately $150 million and $160 million
    related to the sale of our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek
    Inc. We also expect to recognize a gain, net of taxes of between
    approximately $52 million and $60 million related to
    the sale of our CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring
    business. The gains on both of these sales will be included in
    income from discontinued operations.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

Accounting
    for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (FASB), issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS)
    159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115

(SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits entities
    to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain
    other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial
    reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate
    volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related
    assets and liabilities differently without having to apply
    complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective
    as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that
    begins after November 15, 2007, which is our fiscal year
    2009 that begins on November 2, 2008. We are currently
    evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 159 may have on
    our financial condition and results of operations.

Fair
    Value Measurements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157,

Fair Value
    Measurements

(SFAS 157). SFAS 157 provides
    enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and
    liabilities. The standard also responds to investors’
    requests for expanded information about the extent to which
    companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the
    information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair
    value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 applies whenever
    other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be
    measured at fair value. This standard does not expand the use of
    fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS 157 is effective
    for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, which
    is our fiscal year 2009 that begins on November 2, 2008. We
    are currently evaluating the impact that SFAS 157 may have
    on our financial condition and results of operations.

Accounting
    for Prior Year Misstatements

In September 2006, the United States Securities and Exchange
    Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB)
    No. 108,

Considering the Effects of Prior Year
    Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
    Financial Statements

(SAB 108). This SAB provides
    guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year
    misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the
    purpose of a materiality assessment. SAB 108 establishes an
    approach that requires quantification of financial statement
    errors based on the effects on each of the company’s
    balance sheet and statement of operations and the related
    financial statement disclosures. SAB 108 permits existing
    public companies to record the cumulative effect of initially
    applying this approach in the first year ending after
    November 15, 2006 by recording the necessary correcting
    adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as
    of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment
    recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings.
    Additionally, the use of the cumulative effect transition method
    requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each
    individual error being corrected through the cumulative
    adjustment and how and when it arose. The adoption of
    SAB 108 in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 did not have
    any impact on our financial condition or results of operations.



Accounting
    for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans — An Amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132R

(SFAS 158).
    SFAS 158 requires companies to recognize the funded status
    of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on sponsoring
    employers’ balance sheets and to recognize changes in the
    funded status in the year the changes occur. It also requires
    the measurement date of plan assets and obligations to occur at
    the end of the employers’ fiscal year. SFAS 158 was
    effective for us at the end of fiscal 2007, except for the
    change in measurement date, which is effective for us in fiscal
    2009. The adoption of SFAS 158 in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2007 did not have a material impact on our financial
    condition or results of operations.

Accounting
    for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(FIN 48).
    FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income
    taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in
    accordance with SFAS 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes.

FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and
    measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition
    and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
    in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
    derecognition, classification, interest and penalties,
    accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.
    FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the impact,
    if any, that FIN 48 may have on our financial condition or
    results of operations.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of the financial
    condition and results of operations is based upon the
    consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
    accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
    principles. The preparation of these financial statements
    requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
    reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses,
    and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We
    base our estimates and judgments on historical experience,
    knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur
    in the future based on available information. We consider the
    following accounting policies to be both those most important to
    the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require
    the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ
    significantly from management’s estimates and projections,
    there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We
    also have other policies that we consider key accounting
    policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including
    the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the
    products are sold to the end user; however, the application of
    these policies does not require us to make significant estimates
    or judgments that are difficult or subjective.

Inventory
    Valuation

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of
    the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels,
    obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write
    down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of
    methodologies to determine the net realizable value of
    inventory. While a portion of the calculation is determined via
    reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market
    calculations, an element is subject to significant judgments
    made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual
    demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional
    adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in
    future periods.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate,
    for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our
    customers to make required payments. If the financial condition
    of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may
    exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be
    required.



Long-Lived
    Assets

We review property, plant, and equipment and identified
    intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not
    be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by
    comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash
    flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining
    economic lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired,
    the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by
    which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market
    value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a
    value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique.
    Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments
    related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified
    intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except
    those made in conjunction with restructuring actions,
    deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such
    impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of
    impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future
    operating results that are used in the preparation of the
    expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating
    results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived
    assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the
    recoverability of these assets. These differences could result
    in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse
    impact on our results of operations. In addition, in certain
    instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful
    lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the
    remaining net book values over the revised useful lives.

Goodwill

In accordance with SFAS 142,

Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets

, goodwill is subject to annual impairment
    tests, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist
    and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be
    recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. Because
    we have one reporting segment under SFAS 142, we utilize
    the entity-wide approach to assess goodwill for impairment and
    compare our market value to our net book value to determine if
    an impairment exists. These impairment tests may result in
    impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on
    our results of operations.

Accounting
    for Income Taxes

We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

, which requires that deferred
    tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates
    for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax
    bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS 109 also
    requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation
    allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all
    of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We evaluate the
    realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly. At
    November 3, 2007, we had gross deferred tax assets of
    $210.9 million primarily resulting from temporary
    differences between the book and tax bases of assets and
    liabilities. We have conducted an assessment of the likelihood
    of realization of those deferred tax assets and concluded that a
    $46.8 million valuation allowance is needed to reserve the
    amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due
    to the expiration of certain state credit carryovers. In
    reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria
    including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be
    used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior
    carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be
    used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future
    years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change
    due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or
    international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any,
    may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets,
    resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net
    loss in the period when such determinations are made.

In the ordinary course of global business, there are many
    transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is
    uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of
    cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related
    entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no
    assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these
    matters will not be different than that which is reflected in
    our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such
    differences could have a material impact on our income tax
    provision and operating results in the period in which such
    determination is made.



Stock-Based
    Compensation

The adoption of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of fiscal
    2006 required that stock-based compensation expense associated
    with stock options and related awards be recognized in the
    statement of income, rather than being disclosed in a pro forma
    footnote to the consolidated financial statements. Determining
    the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires
    us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date
    fair value of stock options. We calculate the grant-date fair
    values using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The use of
    valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following
    assumptions:

Expected volatility

— We are responsible for
    estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors,
    including third-party estimates, when estimating volatility. For
    options granted prior to fiscal 2005, we used historical
    volatility to estimate the grant-date fair value of stock
    options. We changed our method of estimating expected volatility
    for all stock options granted for fiscal 2005 and thereafter
    from exclusively relying on historical volatility to exclusively
    relying on implied volatility. This change was the result of a
    thorough review we undertook, which included consultations with
    several third-party advisors. Historical volatility during the
    period commensurate with the expected term of our stock options
    over the past several years included a period of time when our
    stock price experienced unprecedented increases and subsequent
    declines. We believe that this past stock price volatility is
    unlikely to be indicative of future stock price behavior, and as
    such, we currently believe that the exclusive use of implied
    volatility results in a more accurate estimate of the grant-date
    fair value of employee stock options because it more
    appropriately reflects the market’s current expectations of
    future volatility. In evaluating the appropriateness of
    exclusively relying on implied volatility we concluded that:
    (1) options in the Company’s common stock are actively
    traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges; (2) the
    market prices of both the traded options and the underlying
    shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and
    on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options;
    (3) the traded options have exercise prices that are both
    near-the-money and close to the exercise price of the employee
    share options; and (4) the maturities of the traded options
    used to estimate volatility are at least one year.

Expected term

— We use historical employee
    exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected
    term assumption for the Black-Scholes grant-date valuation. We
    believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate
    of the expected term of a new option, and that generally, all of
    our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior. In general, the
    longer the expected term used in the Black-Scholes valuation
    model, the higher the grant-date fair value of the option.

Risk-free interest rate

— The yield on
    zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is
    commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the
    risk-free interest rate.

Expected dividend yield

— Expected dividend
    yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by
    our Board of Directors for the current quarter and dividing that
    result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the
    option. Until such time as our Board of Directors declares a
    cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current
    quarter’s cash dividend, the current dividend will be used
    in deriving this assumption. Cash dividends are not paid on
    options, restricted stock or restricted stock units.

The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized during
    a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that
    are ultimately expected to vest. SFAS 123R requires
    forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if
    necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ
    from those estimates. The term “forfeitures” is
    distinct from “cancellations” or
    “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion
    of the surrendered option. Based on an analysis of our
    historical forfeitures, we have applied an annual forfeiture
    rate of 4.3% to all unvested stock-based awards as of
    November 3, 2007. The rate of 4.3% represents the portion
    that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting
    period. This analysis is re-evaluated quarterly and the
    forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the actual
    expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for
    those awards that vest.

Contingencies

From time to time, we receive notices that our products or
    manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or
    intellectual property rights of others. We periodically assess
    each matter to determine if a contingent



liability should be recorded in accordance with SFAS 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

. In making this
    determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter,
    consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical
    experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our
    judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each
    matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent
    loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be
    reasonably estimated. If a loss is probable and reasonably
    estimable, we record a contingent loss in accordance with
    SFAS 5. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we
    consider advice received from experts in the specific matter,
    current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations
    that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. If
    the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may
    need to record additional contingent losses that could
    materially adversely impact our results of operations. See
    Note 12 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial
    Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for additional information regarding our commitments and
    contingencies.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest
    Rate Exposure

Based on our marketable securities and short term investments
    outstanding as of November 3, 2007 and October 28,
    2006, our annual interest income would change by approximately
    $9 million and $16 million, respectively, for each
    100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates. The
    fair values of our investment portfolio at November 3, 2007
    and October 28, 2006 would change by approximately
    $2 million and $6 million, respectively, for each
    100 basis point increase or decrease in rates.

Foreign
    Currency Exposure

As more fully described in Note 2i. in the Notes to
    our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8
    of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

we regularly hedge our

non-U.S. dollar-based

exposures by entering into forward exchange contracts. The terms
    of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the
    underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve
    months. The fair values of these instruments were approximately
    $7 million at November 3, 2007 and were insignificant
    at October 28, 2006. Currently, our largest foreign
    currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European
    operations have the highest proportion of our local currency
    denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures
    existing at November 3, 2007 and October 28, 2006, a
    10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates
    would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash
    flows because we hedge substantially all of our year-end
    exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
    rates. For contracts outstanding at November 3, 2007, a 10%
    unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates from the
    rates as of our 2007 fiscal year end would increase the fair
    value of our foreign currency financial instruments by
    approximately $24 million and a 10% favorable movement in
    foreign currency exchange rates would decrease their fair value
    by approximately $9 million. As at October 28, 2006, a
    10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates from the rates
    as of our 2006 fiscal year end would not expose us to
    significant gains or losses in the contracts’ fair values.
    The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in
    the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition
    to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes
    typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency
    sales price as competitors’ products become more or less
    attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes
    in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a
    potential change in sales levels or local currency selling
    prices.

Description
    of Business

Analog Devices, Inc. (“Analog Devices” or the
    “Company”) is a world leader in the design,
    manufacture and marketing of high-performance analog,
    mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits
    used in industrial, communication, computer and consumer
    applications. Since the Company’s inception in 1965, it has
    focused on solving the engineering challenges associated with
    signal processing in electronic equipment. The Company’s
    products are embedded inside electronics that people come into
    contact with every day. Real world signal processing describes
    the process of converting real-world phenomena such as
    temperature, motion, pressure, light and sound into electrical
    signals to be used in a wide array of electronic equipment
    including industrial process control, factory automation
    systems, defense electronics, portable wireless communications
    devices, cellular basestations, central office networking
    equipment, computers, automobiles, medical imaging equipment,
    digital cameras and digital televisions. Signal processing
    technology is a critical element of high-speed communications,
    digital entertainment, and other consumer, computer and
    industrial applications. As new generations of digital
    applications evolve, they generate new needs for
    high-performance analog signal processing and digital signal
    processing, or DSP, technology. The Company produces a wide
    range of products that are designed to meet the signal
    processing technology needs of a broad base of customers.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

a.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon
    consolidation, all intercompany accounts and transactions are
    eliminated. Amounts pertaining to the non-controlling ownership
    interest held by third parties in the operating results and
    financial position of the Company’s majority-owned
    subsidiaries are reported as “minority interest.” The
    Company’s fiscal year is the 52-week or 53-week period
    ending on the Saturday closest to the last day in October.
    Fiscal year 2007 was a 53-week period. Fiscal years 2006 and
    2005 were 52-week periods.

In September 2007, the Company entered into a definitive
    agreement to sell its baseband chipset business and related
    support operations, or Baseband Chipset Business, to MediaTek
    Inc. Accordingly, the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements and related footnote disclosures have been restated
    for all reporting periods presented to reflect the results of
    these operations as discontinued operations, and unless
    otherwise noted, discussions in these notes pertain to the
    Company’s continuing operations. See Note 2u. for
    additional information on the Company’s discontinued
    operations.

b.

Cash,
    Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments

Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with
    insignificant interest rate risk and maturities of three months
    or less at the time of acquisition. Cash, cash equivalents and
    short-term investments consist primarily of corporate
    obligations such as commercial paper and corporate bonds, and
    Treasury and government agency notes and bonds. They also
    include bank time deposits and institutional money market funds.

The Company classifies its investments in readily marketable
    debt and equity securities as “held-to-maturity,”
    “available-for-sale” or “trading” at the
    time of purchase. There were no transfers between investment
    classifications in any of the fiscal years presented.
    Held-to-maturity securities, which are carried at amortized
    cost, include only those securities the Company has the positive
    intent and ability to hold to maturity. Securities, such as bank
    time deposits, which by their nature are typically held to
    maturity, are classified as such. The Company’s other
    readily marketable cash equivalents and short-term investments
    are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale
    securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and
    losses, net of related tax, if any, reported in accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss), which is a separate component
    of shareholders’ equity. The Company’s



ANALOG
    DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

deferred compensation plan investments are classified as
    trading. See Note 7 for additional information on the
    Company’s deferred compensation plan investments. Realized
    gains and losses, as well as interest, and dividends on all
    securities, are included in earnings.

The Company’s short-term investments are adjusted to fair
    value at the end of each quarter. These adjustments to fair
    value are recorded as an increase or decrease in accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss). No realized gains or losses
    were recorded during any of the fiscal years presented.

The Company periodically evaluates these investments for
    impairment in accordance with EITF Issue

No. 03-01,

The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its
    Application to Certain Investments

. When a decline in fair
    value is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the Company records
    an impairment adjustment in the statement of income. There were
    no other-than-temporary impairments of short-term investments in
    any of the fiscal years presented.

Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale short-term
    investments were as follows:

The Company’s primary non-cash financing activities in
    fiscal 2006 and 2005 resulted from the amortization of unearned
    stock compensation expense associated with the Company’s
    2001 acquisitions for which 1,462,066 shares of common
    stock were issued (valued at approximately $81.8 million)
    and unvested stock options with an intrinsic value of
    approximately $11.9 million were assumed. As a result, the
    Company recognized stock-based compensation expense over the
    vesting period of $0.5 million in fiscal 2006 and
    $3.6 million in fiscal 2005.

d.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out method) or market. The valuation of inventory requires
    the Company to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as
    inventory that is not of saleable quality. The Company employs a
    variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value
    of its inventory. While a portion of the calculation to record
    inventory at its net realizable value is based on the age of the
    inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, a key factor
    in estimating obsolete or excess inventory requires the company
    to estimate the future demand for its products. If actual demand
    is less than the Company’s estimates, impairment charges,
    which are recorded to cost of sales, may need to be recorded in
    future periods. Inventory in excess of saleable amounts is not
    valued, and the remaining inventory is valued at the lower of
    cost or market.

Inventories at November 3, 2007 and October 28, 2006
    were as follows:

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost less
    allowances for depreciation. The straight-line method of
    depreciation is used for all classes of assets for financial
    statement purposes; both straight-line and accelerated methods
    are used for income tax purposes. Leasehold improvements are
    amortized based upon the lesser of the term of the lease or the
    useful life of the asset. Depreciation and amortization are
    based on the following useful lives:

Buildings & building equipment

Up to 25 years

Machinery & equipment

3-8 years

Office equipment

3-8 years

Depreciation expense from continuing operations of property,
    plant and equipment was $139 million, $165 million and
    $151 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable.
    Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of
    their carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows the
    assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic
    lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
    impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by
    which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market
    value

determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value
    determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. If
    such assets are not impaired, but their useful lives have
    decreased, the remaining net book value is amortized over the
    revised useful life.

f.

Goodwill
    and Intangible Assets

Goodwill

The Company annually evaluates goodwill for impairment as well
    as whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the
    carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Because the
    Company has one reporting segment under SFAS 142, the
    Company utilizes the entity-wide approach for assessing goodwill
    for impairment and compares its market value to its net book
    value to determine if an impairment exists. No impairment of
    goodwill resulted from the Company’s most recent evaluation
    of goodwill for impairment, which occurred in the fourth quarter
    of fiscal 2007. No impairment of goodwill resulted in any of the
    fiscal years presented. The Company’s next annual
    impairment assessment will be made in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2008 unless indicators arise that would require the
    Company to reevaluate at an earlier date. The following table
    presents the changes in goodwill during fiscal 2007 and 2006:

The Company completed the final purchase accounting for this
    transaction during the first quarter of fiscal 2007, which
    resulted in an additional $5.6 million of goodwill. The
    Company also purchased additional outstanding minority shares
    related to this acquisition during fiscal 2007, which resulted
    in an additional $7.7 million of goodwill.

Intangible
    Assets

The Company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability
    of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying
    value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected
    to generate over their remaining economic lives. If such assets
    are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized
    in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the
    assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a
    quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing
    a discounted cash flow technique.

During fiscal 2006, the Company purchased certain assets from
    TTPCom Limited (TTPCom), substantially all of the shares of
    Integrant Technologies, Inc. and all of the shares of AudioAsics
    A/S (AudioAsics). See Note 6 for additional information on

    years. The remaining amortization expense will be recognized
    over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.6 years.
    The $43.1 million of intangible assets acquired during
    fiscal 2006 will be amortized over their estimated useful lives
    of two to five years using an accelerated method of amortization
    that is expected to reflect the estimated pattern of economic
    use.

Grant
    Accounting

Certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries have received
    various grants from governmental agencies. These grants include
    capital, employment and research and development grants. Capital
    grants for the acquisition of property and equipment are netted
    against the related capital expenditures and amortized as a
    credit to depreciation expense over the useful life of the
    related asset. Employment grants, which relate to employee
    hiring and training, and research and development grants are
    recognized in earnings in the period in which the related
    expenditures are incurred by the Company.

h.

Translation
    of Foreign Currencies

The functional currency for the Company’s foreign sales and
    research and development operations is the applicable local
    currency. Gains and losses resulting from translation of these
    foreign currencies into U.S. dollars are recorded in
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Transaction gains
    and losses and remeasurement of foreign currency denominated
    assets and liabilities are included in income currently,
    including those at the Company’s principal foreign
    manufacturing operations where the functional currency is the
    U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses
    included in other expenses, net, were not material in fiscal
    2007, 2006 or 2005.

i.

Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Agreements

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to
    offset certain operational and balance sheet exposures from the
    impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Such
    exposures result from the portion of the Company’s
    operations, assets and liabilities that are denominated in
    currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily Euro;
    other exposures include Philippine Peso, British Pounds Sterling
    and Japanese Yen. These foreign exchange contracts are entered
    into to support product sales, purchases and financing
    transactions made in the normal course of business, and
    accordingly, are not speculative in nature. In accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133
    (SFAS 133),

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities

, hedges related to anticipated
    transactions are designated and documented at the inception of
    the respective hedges as cash flow hedges and are evaluated for
    effectiveness monthly.

The Company records all derivative financial instruments in the
    consolidated financial statements in other current assets or
    accrued liabilities, depending on their net position, at fair
    value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the
    instrument. Changes in the fair value of the derivative
    financial instruments are either recognized periodically in
    earnings or in shareholders’ equity as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) or loss depending
    on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for
    hedge accounting as defined by SFAS 133. Changes in fair
    values of derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting are
    reported in earnings as they occur.

Foreign Exchange Exposure Management

— The
    Company has significant international sales and purchase
    transactions in foreign currencies and has a policy of hedging
    forecasted and actual foreign currency risk with forward foreign
    exchange contracts. The Company’s forward foreign exchange
    contracts are denominated primarily in Euro and other currencies
    including Philippine Peso, British Pounds Sterling and Japanese
    Yen. The contracts are for periods consistent with the terms of
    the underlying transactions, generally one year or less.
    Derivative instruments are employed to eliminate or minimize
    certain foreign currency exposures that can be confidently
    identified and quantified. In accordance with SFAS 133,
    hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and
    documented at the inception of the respective hedges as cash
    flow hedges and are evaluated for effectiveness monthly. As the
    terms of the contract and the underlying transaction are matched
    at inception, forward contract effectiveness is calculated by
    comparing the change in fair value of the contract to the change
    in the forward value of the anticipated transaction, with the
    effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative
    instrument reported as a component of OCI in shareholders’
    equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period during
    which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any residual
    change in fair value of the instruments, or

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

ineffectiveness, is recognized immediately in other
    income/expense. Ineffectiveness was immaterial in fiscal 2007,
    2006 and 2005.

Additionally, the Company enters into forward foreign currency
    contracts that economically hedge the gains and losses generated
    by the remeasurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities
    in a non-functional currency. Changes in the fair value of these
    undesignated hedges are recognized in other income/expense
    immediately as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the
    asset or liability being hedged.

Derivative financial instruments involve, to a varying degree,
    elements of market and credit risk not recognized in the
    consolidated financial statements. The market risk associated
    with these instruments resulting from currency exchange rate or
    interest rate movements is expected to offset the market risk of
    the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being
    hedged. The counterparties to the agreements relating to the
    Company’s foreign exchange and interest rate instruments
    consist of a number of major international financial
    institutions with high credit ratings. The Company does not
    believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by
    these counterparties because the Company continually monitors
    the credit ratings of such counterparties, and limits the
    financial exposure with any one financial institution. While the
    contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments
    provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do
    not represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to
    credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk
    (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet
    the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the
    amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations
    under the contracts exceed the obligations of the Company to the
    counterparties.

Accumulated
    Derivative Gains or Losses

The following table summarizes activity in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives classified as

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments

— These investments, except for
    those classified as held-to-maturity, which are carried at
    amortized cost, are adjusted to fair value based on quoted
    market prices or are determined using a yield curve model based
    on current market rates.

Deferred compensation plan investments and other
    investments

— The fair value of these
    investments is based on quoted market prices, with the exception
    of private-company equity investments that are carried at cost,
    adjusted for impairment charges.

Interest rate swap and cap agreements

—
    The fair value of interest rate swap and cap agreements is
    obtained from dealer quotes. These values represent the
    estimated amount the Company would receive or pay to terminate
    the agreements taking into consideration current interest rates.

Forward foreign currency exchange
    contracts

— The estimated fair value of
    forward foreign currency exchange contracts, which includes
    derivatives that are accounted for as cash flow hedges and those
    that are not designated as cash flow hedges, is based on the
    estimated amount at which they could be settled based on forward
    market exchange rates.

k.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial
    statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
    during the reporting period. Such estimates relate to the useful
    lives of fixed assets and identified intangible assets,
    allowances for doubtful accounts and customer returns, the net
    realizable value of inventory, potential reserves relating to
    litigation matters, accrued liabilities, accrued taxes, deferred
    tax valuation allowances, assumptions pertaining to share-based
    payments and other reserves. Actual results could differ from
    those estimates, and such differences may be material to the
    financial statements.

Concentrations
    of Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
    concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments
    and trade accounts receivable.

The Company maintains cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments and long-term investments with high credit quality
    financial institutions and monitors the amount of credit
    exposure to any one financial institution and issuer.

The Company sells its products to distributors and original
    equipment manufacturers involved in a variety of industries
    including industrial process automation, instrumentation,
    defense/aerospace, automotive, communications, computers and
    computer peripherals and consumer electronics. The Company has
    adopted credit policies and standards to accommodate growth in
    these markets. The Company performs continuing credit
    evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and
    although the Company generally does not require collateral,
    letters of credit may be required from its customers in certain
    circumstances. Reserves are provided for estimated amounts of
    accounts receivable that may not be collected.

m.

Concentration
    of Other Risks

The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid
    technological change, competitive pricing pressures and cyclical
    market patterns. The Company’s financial results are
    affected by a wide variety of factors, including general
    economic conditions worldwide, economic conditions specific to
    the semiconductor industry, the timely implementation of new
    manufacturing technologies, the ability to safeguard patents and
    intellectual property in a rapidly evolving market and reliance
    on assembly and test subcontractors, third-party wafer
    fabricators and independent distributors. In addition, the
    semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject
    to significant economic downturns at various times. The Company
    is exposed to the risk of obsolescence of its inventory
    depending on the mix of future business. Additionally, a large
    portion of the Company’s external wafer purchase and
    foundry services are from a limited number of suppliers,
    primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). If
    TSMC or any of the Company’s other key suppliers are unable
    or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of
    components, on the time schedule and of the quality that the
    Company requires, the Company may be forced to seek to engage
    additional or replacement suppliers, which could result in
    significant expenses and disruptions or delays in manufacturing,
    product development and shipment of product to the
    Company’s customers. Although the Company has experienced
    shortages of components, materials and external foundry services
    from time to time, these items have generally been available to
    the Company as needed.

n.

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to
    distributors are deferred until the distributors resell the
    products to end-users. Deferred amounts are presented net and
    included as “Deferred income on shipments to
    distributors” in the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheets. Revenue from product sales to end-users is recognized
    when title passes, which for shipments to certain foreign
    countries is subsequent to product shipment. Title for these
    shipments ordinarily passes within a week of shipment. A reserve
    for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based
    on historical experience or specific identification of an event
    necessitating a reserve. During the first quarter of fiscal
    2007, the Company recorded revenue of $35 million received
    in exchange for licensing of certain intellectual property
    rights to a third party.

Shipping costs are charged to cost of sales as incurred.

The Company generally offers a

12-month

warranty for its products. The Company’s warranty policy
    provides for replacement of the defective product. Specific
    accruals are recorded for known product warranty issues. Product
    warranty expenses during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 were not
    material.

    differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets
    and liabilities and are measured using the enacted income tax
    rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the
    temporary differences are expected to reverse. Additionally,
    deferred tax assets and liabilities are separated into current
    and noncurrent amounts based on the classification of the
    related assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes.

Earnings
    Per Share of Common Stock

Basic earnings per share is computed based only on the weighted
    average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
    Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted
    average number of common shares outstanding during the period,
    plus the dilutive effect of potential future issuances of common
    stock relating to stock option programs and other potentially
    dilutive securities using the treasury stock method. In
    calculating diluted earnings per share, the dilutive effect of
    stock options is computed using the average market price for the
    respective period. In addition, under SFAS 123R, the
    assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method include the
    average unrecognized compensation expense of stock options that
    are in-the-money. This results in the “assumed”
    buyback of additional shares, thereby reducing the dilutive
    impact of stock options. Potential shares related to certain of
    the Company’s outstanding stock options were excluded
    because they were anti-dilutive. Those potential shares,
    determined based on the weighted average exercise prices during
    the respective years, related to the Company’s outstanding
    stock options could be dilutive in the future.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(SFAS 123R). SFAS 123R supersedes APB Opinion
    No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

,
    and amends SFAS No. 95,

Statement of Cash
    Flows

. Generally, the approach in SFAS 123R is similar
    to the approach described in SFAS 123

Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation

. However, SFAS 123R requires
    all share-based payments to employees, including grants of
    employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement
    over their vesting period based on their fair values at the date
    of grant. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative.

On October 30, 2005 (the first day of its 2006 fiscal
    year), the Company adopted SFAS 123R using the modified
    prospective method as permitted under SFAS 123R. Under this
    transition method, compensation cost recognized in fiscal 2006
    and fiscal 2007 includes: (a) compensation cost for all
    share-based payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of
    October 29, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value
    estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123,
    and (b) compensation cost for all share-based payments
    granted subsequent to October 29, 2005, based on the
    grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS 123R. In accordance with the modified
    prospective method of adoption, the Company’s results of
    operations and financial position for prior periods have not
    been restated.

    stock-based compensation.

New
    Accounting Standards

Accounting
    for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (FASB), issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS)
    159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115

(SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits entities
    to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain
    other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial
    reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate
    volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related
    assets and liabilities differently without having to apply
    complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective
    as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that
    begins after November 15, 2007, which is the Company’s
    fiscal year 2009 that begins on November 2, 2008. The
    Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any that
    SFAS 159 may have on the Company’s financial condition
    and results of operations.

Fair
    Value Measurements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157,

“Fair
    Value Measurements.”

SFAS 157 provides enhanced
    guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities.
    The standard also responds to investors’ requests for
    expanded information about the extent to which companies measure
    assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to
    measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on
    earnings. SFAS 157 applies whenever other standards require
    or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value.
    This standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new
    circumstances. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007, which is the
    Company’s fiscal year 2009 that begins on November 2,
    2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any
    that SFAS 157 will have on the Company’s financial
    condition and results of operations.

Accounting
    for Prior Year Misstatements

In September 2006, the United States Securities and Exchange
    Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB)
    No. 108,

Considering the Effects of Prior Year
    Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
    Financial Statements

(SAB 108). This SAB provides
    guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year
    misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the
    purpose of a materiality assessment. SAB 108 establishes an
    approach that requires quantification of financial statement
    errors based on the effects of each of the company’s
    balance sheet and statement of operations financial statements
    and the related financial statement disclosures. The SAB permits
    existing public companies to record the cumulative effect of
    initially applying this approach in the first year ending after
    November 15, 2006 by recording the necessary correcting
    adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as
    of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment
    recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings.
    Additionally, the use of the cumulative effect transition method
    requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each
    individual error being corrected through the cumulative
    adjustment and how and when it arose. The adoption of
    SAB 108 did not have any impact on the Company’s
    financial conditions or results of operations.

Accounting
    for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(FIN 48).
    FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income
    taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in
    accordance with SFAS 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes.

FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and
    measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition
    and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
    in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
    derecognition, classification, interest and penalties,
    accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.
    FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2006. The Company is currently evaluating the
    impact, if any, that FIN 48 may have on the Company’s
    financial condition or results of operations.

Discontinued
    Operations

In September 2007, the Company entered into a definitive
    agreement to sell its Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc.
    The Company expects to complete the sale in the first quarter of
    2008 for approximately $350 million in cash. The decision
    to sell the Baseband Chipset Business was due to the
    Company’s decision to focus its resources in areas where
    its signal processing expertise can provide unique capabilities
    and earn superior returns. In accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
    Long-Lived Assets (SFAS 144)

, the Company determined
    that the Baseband Chipset Business became a long-lived asset
    held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2007. SFAS 144
    provides that a long-lived asset classified as held for sale
    should be measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair
    value less cost to sell. Since the carrying value of the
    Baseband Chipset Business at November 3, 2007 was less than
    the estimated fair value less cost to sell, no adjustment to the
    carrying value of this long-lived asset was necessary during the
    year ended November 3, 2007. In accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS 144, the Company ceased the amortization
    of the Baseband Chipset Business’ intangible assets and the
    depreciation of the Baseband Chipset Business’ property and
    equipment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.

Also, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144, the
    Company determined that the Baseband Chipset Business became a
    discontinued operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.
    Accordingly, the assets and liabilities and operating results of
    the Baseband Chipset Business have been segregated from the
    consolidated balance sheets and continuing operations in the
    consolidated statements of income for all periods presented.
    Because the Baseband Chipset Business’ cash flows were not
    material for any period presented, they have not been segregated
    on the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Stock-Based
    Compensation and Shareholders’ Equity

Equity
    Compensation Plans

The Company grants, or has granted, stock options and other
    stock and stock-based awards under the following equity
    compensation plans:

2006 Stock Incentive Plan (2006 Plan)

— The
    2006 Plan was approved by the Company’s Board of Directors
    on January 23, 2006 and was approved by shareholders on
    March 14, 2006 and subsequently amended in March 2006. The
    2006 Plan provides for the grant of up to 15 million shares
    of the Company’s common stock, plus such number of
    additional shares that were subject to outstanding options under
    the Company’s 1998 Stock Option Plan and the 2001
    Broad-Based Stock Option Plan as of January 23, 2006 that
    are not issued because the applicable option award subsequently
    terminates or expires without being exercised. The 2006 Plan
    provides for the grant of incentive stock options intended to
    qualify under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of
    1986, as amended, or non-statutory stock options, stock
    appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units
    and other stock-based awards. Employees, officers, directors,
    consultants and advisors of the Company and its subsidiaries are
    eligible to be granted awards under the 2006 Plan. No award may
    be made under the 2006 Plan after March 13, 2016, but
    awards previously granted may extend beyond that date. The
    Company will not grant further options under the 1998 Plan or
    the 2001 Plan.

2001 Broad-Based Stock Option Plan (2001
    Plan)

— The 2001 Plan was adopted by the
    Company’s Board of Directors in December 2001 and
    subsequently amended in December 2002. The 2001 Plan provides
    for the issuance of options to purchase up to 50 million
    shares of common stock to employees, consultants or advisors of
    the Company and its subsidiaries, other than executive officers
    and directors. As a result of the approval of the 2006 Plan, no
    further grants were made under the 2001 Plan.

The 1998 Stock Option Plan (1998 Plan)

— The
    1998 Plan was approved by shareholders in fiscal 1998 and
    subsequently amended in December 2001 and December 2002. The
    1998 Plan provides for the issuance of nonstatutory and
    incentive stock options to purchase up to 30 million shares
    of common stock. In March 2000, the Company’s shareholders
    approved an amendment to the 1998 Plan to increase the shares
    reserved for issuance under the 1998 Plan by an additional
    34 million shares. As a result of the approval of the 2006
    Plan, no further grants were made under the 1998 Plan.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

While the Company may grant to employees options that become
    exercisable at different times or within different periods, the
    Company has generally granted to employees options that vest
    over five years and become exercisable in annual installments of


/


%
    on each of the third, fourth, and fifth anniversaries of the
    date of grant; in annual installments of 25% on each of the
    second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of
    grant; or 20% on each of the first, second, third, fourth and
    fifth anniversaries of the date of grant. The maximum
    contractual term of all options is ten years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plans

— The Company
    also has employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs) that allow
    eligible employees to purchase, through payroll deductions,
    shares of the Company’s common stock at 85% of the fair
    market value at specified dates. Employees may withdraw from an
    offering before the purchase date and obtain a refund of the
    amounts withheld through payroll deductions plus accrued
    interest. The final offering period began June 1, 2005 and
    ended on June 1, 2006; therefore, June 1, 2005 was
    considered the grant date for the purposes of recognizing the
    stock-based compensation expense for that offering period.
    During fiscal 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors
    decided that the final offering period, which ended June 1,
    2006, would be the last offering period under the ESPPs. Under
    APB Opinion No. 25, the Company was not required to
    recognize stock-based compensation expense for the cost of stock
    options or shares issued under the Company’s ESPPs. Upon
    adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company began recording
    stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPPs.

Grant-Date
    Fair Value

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to
    calculate the grant-date fair value of an award. The fair values
    of options granted were calculated using the following estimated
    weighted-average assumptions:

Expected volatility — The Company is responsible for
    estimating volatility and has considered a number of factors,
    including third-party estimates, when estimating volatility. For
    options granted prior to fiscal 2005, the Company used
    historical volatility to estimate the grant-date fair value of
    stock options. The Company changed its method of estimating
    expected volatility for all stock options granted after fiscal
    2004 from exclusively relying on historical volatility to
    exclusively relying on implied volatility. This change was the
    result of a thorough review the Company undertook, which
    included consultations with several third-party advisors.
    Historical volatility during the period commensurate with the
    expected term of the Company’s stock options over the past
    several years included a period of time when the Company’s
    stock price experienced unprecedented increases and subsequent
    declines. The Company believes that this past stock price
    volatility is unlikely to be indicative of future stock price
    behavior, and as such, the Company currently believes that the
    exclusive use of implied volatility results in a more accurate
    estimate of the grant-date fair value of employee stock options
    because it more appropriately reflects the market’s current
    expectations of future volatility. In evaluating the
    appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility the
    Company concluded that: (1) options in the Company’s
    common stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on
    several exchanges; (2) the market prices of both the traded
    options and the underlying shares are measured at a similar
    point in time to each other and on a date close to the grant
    date of the employee share options; (3) the traded options



ANALOG
    DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

have exercise prices that are both near-the-money and close to
    the exercise price of the employee share options; and
    (4) the maturities of the traded options used to estimate
    volatility are at least one year.

Expected term — The Company uses historical employee
    exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected
    term assumption for the Black-Scholes grant-date valuation. The
    Company believes that this historical data is currently the best
    estimate of the expected term of a new option, and that
    generally its employees exhibit similar exercise behavior.

Risk-free interest rate — The yield on zero-coupon
    U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate
    with the expected term assumption is used as the risk-free
    interest rate.

Expected dividend yield — Expected dividend yield is
    calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by the
    Company’s Board of Directors for the current quarter and
    dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of
    grant. Until such time as the Company’s Board of Directors
    declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from
    the current quarter’s cash dividend, the current dividend
    will be used in deriving this assumption. Cash dividends are not
    paid on options, restricted stock or restricted stock units.

Stock-based
    Compensation Expense

The Company used the graded attribution method to recognize
    expense for all stock-based awards prior to the adoption of
    SFAS 123R. Upon adoption of SFAS 123R on
    October 30, 2005, the Company changed to the straight-line
    attribution method to recognize expense for stock-based awards
    granted after October 29, 2005. The change to the
    straight-line attribution method was made so that the expense
    associated with each stock-based award is recognized ratably
    over the vesting period. The expense associated with the
    unvested portion of the pre-adoption grants will continue to be
    expensed using the graded attribution method.

The amount of stock-based compensation recognized during a
    period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that
    are ultimately expected to vest. SFAS 123R requires
    forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if
    necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ
    from those estimates. The term “forfeitures” is
    distinct from “cancellations” or
    “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion
    of the surrendered stock-based award. Based on an analysis of
    its historical forfeitures, the Company has applied an annual
    forfeiture rate of 4.3% to all unvested stock-based awards as of
    November 3, 2007. The rate of 4.3% represents the portion
    that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting
    period. This analysis will be re-evaluated quarterly and the
    forfeiture rate will be adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the
    actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be
    for those shares that vest.

The Company’s stock option agreements historically provided
    for retirement-related continued vesting for a portion, or all,
    of certain stock options based on the optionee’s age and
    years of service (the retirement provision) in that regardless
    of whether the employee continues to provide services, the
    optionee receives the benefit of the stock option.
    SFAS 123R clarifies the timing for recognizing stock-based
    compensation expense for awards subject to continued vesting
    upon meeting this retirement provision. This compensation
    expense must be recognized over the period from the date of
    grant to the date retirement eligibility is met if it is shorter
    than the requisite service period. Upon adoption of
    SFAS 123R in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company
    changed its policy regarding the timing of option expense
    recognition for optionees meeting the criteria of the retirement
    provision to recognize compensation cost over the period through
    the date that the optionee is no longer required to provide
    service to earn the award. Prior to the adoption of
    SFAS 123R, the Company’s policy was to recognize these
    compensation costs over the vesting term. Had the Company
    applied these non-substantive vesting provisions required by
    SFAS 123R to awards granted prior to the adoption of
    SFAS 123R, the impact on the pro forma net earnings
    presented below would have been immaterial. Effective during the
    third fiscal quarter of fiscal 2006, new grants will not include
    a provision that provides for retirement-related continued
    vesting.

The adoption of SFAS 123R had the following impact on
    fiscal 2007 results: operating profit from continuing operations
    before tax was lower by $67.0 million, net income from
    continuing operations was lower by

$47.3 million, cash flow from operations was lower by
    $40.9 million, cash flow from financing activities was
    higher by $40.9 million and basic and diluted EPS were
    lower by $0.15 and $0.14, respectively.

The adoption of SFAS 123R on October 30, 2005 had the
    following impact on fiscal 2006 results: operating profit from
    continuing operations before tax was lower by
    $69.8 million, net income from continuing operations was
    lower by $49.7 million, cash flow from operations was lower
    by $181.2 million, cash flow from financing activities was

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R on October 18,
    2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of all unvested stock
    options awarded to employees after December 31, 2000 that
    had exercise prices of $40.00 per share or greater. The vesting
    of options issued to its corporate officers and directors was
    not accelerated. Unvested options to purchase approximately
    18 million shares became exercisable as a result of the
    vesting acceleration. Because the exercise price of all the
    modified options was greater than the market price of the
    Company’s underlying common stock on the date of the
    modification, no stock-based compensation expense was recorded
    in the statement of income, in accordance with APB Opinion
    No. 25. The primary purpose for modifying the terms of
    these out-of-the-money stock options to accelerate their vesting
    was to eliminate the need to recognize the remaining
    unrecognized non-cash compensation expense in the statement of
    income associated with these options as measured under
    SFAS 123, because the approximately $188 million
    ($134 million net of tax) of future expense associated with
    these options would have been disproportionately high compared
    to the economic value of the options at the date of modification.

In addition to the vested options, the Company expects a portion
    of the unvested options to vest at some point in the future.
    Options expected to vest is calculated by applying an estimated
    forfeiture rate to the unvested options.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised (i.e. the
    difference between the market price at exercise and the price
    paid by the employee to exercise the options) during fiscal 2007
    was $152.6 million and the total amount of cash received by
    the Company from exercise of these options was
    $109.1 million. The total grant-date fair value of stock
    options that vested during fiscal 2007 was approximately
    $72.8 million.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised (i.e. the
    difference between the market price at exercise and the price
    paid by the employee to exercise the options) during fiscal 2006
    was $113.6 million and the total amount of cash received by
    the Company from exercise of these options was
    $82.4 million. The total grant-date fair value of stock
    options that vested during fiscal 2006 was approximately
    $145.5 million.

The 2006 Plan provides that for purposes of determining the
    number of shares available for issuance under the 2006 Plan, any
    restricted stock award, restricted stock unit or other
    stock-based award with a per share or per unit price lower than
    the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant
    (a “Full-Value Award”) will be counted as three shares
    for each share subject to the Full-Value Award.

As of November 3, 2007, a total of 95,135,367 common shares
    were reserved for issuance under the Company’s stock option
    plans.

Common
    Stock Repurchase Program

In August 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors approved
    the repurchase of up to $500 million of the Company’s
    common stock. On May 11, 2005, the Company’s Board of
    Directors amended the stock repurchase program by increasing the
    total amount of the Company’s common stock the Company is
    authorized to repurchase from $500 million to
    $1 billion of common stock. On March 14, 2006, the
    Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by the Company of
    an additional $1 billion of the Company’s common
    stock, increasing the total amount of the Company’s common
    stock the Company can repurchase from $1 billion to
    $2 billion of the Company’s

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

common stock. On December 6, 2006, the Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase by the Company of an additional
    $1 billion of common stock, increasing the total amount of
    common stock the Company is authorized to repurchase from
    $2 billion to $3 billion. On June 6, 2007, the
    Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional
    $1 billion of common stock, increasing the total amount of
    common stock the Company is authorized to repurchase from
    $3 billion to $4 billion. Under the repurchase
    program, the Company may repurchase outstanding shares of its
    common stock from time to time in the open market and through
    privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by
    resolution of the Company’s Board of Directors, the
    repurchase program will expire when the Company has repurchased
    all shares authorized under the program. The Company repurchased
    a total of 45.9 million shares for approximately
    $1,647.2 million during fiscal 2007. As of November 3,
    2007, the Company had repurchased approximately
    95.1 million shares of its common stock for approximately
    $3,334.8 million under this program and an additional
    $665.2 million remains under the current authorized
    program. The repurchased shares are held as authorized but
    unissued shares of common stock. The Company plans to continue
    to repurchase shares during fiscal 2008. The timing and number
    of shares repurchased can not be reasonably estimated at this
    time; however, from the end of fiscal year 2007 through
    November 26, 2007, the Company repurchased approximately
    4.6 million shares for approximately $151 million.

Preferred
    Stock

The Company has 471,934 authorized shares of $1.00 par
    value preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding.
    The Board of Directors is authorized to fix designations,
    relative rights, preferences and limitations on the preferred
    stock at the time of issuance.

Common
    Stock Purchase Rights

In March 1998, the Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder
    Rights Plan (the Stockholder Rights Plan) that replaced a plan
    adopted by the Board in 1988. Pursuant to the Stockholder Rights
    Plan, after giving effect to the Company’s two-for-one
    stock split effected on March 15, 2000, each share of the
    Company’s common stock had an associated one-half of a
    right. Under certain circumstances, each whole right would have
    entitled the registered holder to purchase from the Company one
    one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating
    Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $180 in cash, subject to
    adjustment.

On January 23, 2006, the Company, by vote of its Board of
    Directors, terminated its Stockholder Rights Plan. All rights
    outstanding under the Stockholder Rights Plan were redeemed at a
    redemption price of $0.0005 per right (as adjusted to reflect
    the two-for-one split of the Company’s common stock on
    March 15, 2000) (as adjusted, the
    “Redemption Price”) and paid on March 15,
    2006 to the holders of record of the Company’s common stock
    on February 24, 2006. All rights to exercise rights issued
    under the Stockholder Rights Plan terminated on January 23,
    2006 and the only right thereafter of the holders of rights
    issued under the Stockholder Rights Plan was to receive the
    Redemption Price.

    the “ship to” customer information and the end
    customer product or application into which our product will be
    incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this
    data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end
    market can vary over time. When

Revenue
    Trends by Product

The following table summarizes revenue by product categories.
    The categorization of the Company’s products into broad
    categories is based on the characteristics of the individual
    products, the specification of the products and in some cases
    the specific uses that certain products have within
    applications. The categorization of products into categories is
    therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over
    time. In instances where products move between product
    categories the Company reclassifies the amounts in the product
    categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications
    typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the
    underlying trends of results within, each product category.

Production is expected to cease in the six-inch wafer
    fabrication facility during the first half of fiscal year 2009.
    Therefore, the severance benefits for this action are recorded
    as other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance
    sheet.

Closure
    of Wafer Fabrication Facility in Sunnyvale

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company recorded a
    special charge of $20.3 million as a result of a decision
    to close its California wafer fabrication operations and
    transfer virtually all of the production of products
    manufactured there to the Company’s facility in Wilmington,
    Massachusetts. The charge was for severance and fringe benefit
    costs that were recorded pursuant to SFAS 88,

Employers’ Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments
    of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination
    Benefits

, or SFAS 88, under the Company’s ongoing
    benefit plan for 339 manufacturing employees and 28 general and
    administrative employees. The severance benefit was calculated
    based on length of past service, and employees had to continue
    to be employed until they were involuntarily terminated in order
    to receive the severance benefit. The Company completed the
    final cleanup and closure activities associated with this action
    during the second quarter of fiscal 2007.

In addition to the charge recorded in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2005, the Company recorded additional expense during
    fiscal 2006, which consisted of $18.3 million of non-cash
    cost of sales expenses for additional depreciation due to
    shortened useful lives of certain manufacturing equipment and
    $2.0 million for stay-on bonuses. The Company reversed
    approximately $2.0 million of its severance accrual during
    fiscal 2006 because some employees voluntarily left the Company,
    other employees found alternative employment within the Company,
    and there was an over accrual related to fringe benefits because
    severance payments, normally paid as income continuance, were
    paid in lump sum payments, which reduced the benefit costs
    associated with these payments. The employment of all of the
    remaining employees included in this action has been terminated
    by the Company.

The Company ceased production at the wafer fabrication facility
    on November 9, 2006. During the first quarter of fiscal
    2007, the Company recorded additional expense, in accordance
    with SFAS 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit
    or Disposal Activities,

which consisted of $3.2 million
    for

clean-up

and closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred and
    $0.4 million for lease obligation costs for a warehouse
    facility the Company ceased using during the first quarter of
    fiscal 2007. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the
    Company recorded a special charge, in accordance with
    SFAS 146, which included $5.0 million of expense for
    future lease obligation costs for the wafer fabrication facility
    that the Company ceased using during the second quarter of
    fiscal 2007. Also included in the special charge was
    $1.7 million for

clean-up

and
    closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred. The

clean-up

activity was completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2007,
    and the Company does not expect to incur any additional charges
    related to this action.

Reorganization
    of Product Development and Support Programs

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company recorded a
    special charge of $11.2 million as a result of its decision
    to reorganize its product development and support programs with
    the goal of providing greater focus on its analog and digital
    signal processing product programs. The charge was for severance
    and fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to
    SFAS 88 under the Company’s ongoing benefit plan or
    statutory requirements at foreign locations for 60 manufacturing
    employees and 154 engineering and selling, marketing, general
    and administrative employees.

During fiscal 2006, the Company recorded an additional special
    charge of $3.8 million related to this reorganization
    action. Approximately $1.5 million of this charge was for
    lease obligation costs for a facility the Company ceased using
    during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and the write-off of
    property, plant and equipment and other items at this facility.
    The remaining $2.3 million related to severance and fringe
    benefit costs that were recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal
    2006 pursuant to SFAS 88 under the Company’s ongoing
    benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for
    46 engineering and selling, marketing, general and
    administrative employees.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company recorded an
    additional special charge of $1.6 million related to this
    reorganization action. Approximately $0.6 million of this
    charge was for contract termination costs.



ANALOG

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The remaining $1.0 million relates to severance and fringe
    benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under the
    Company’s ongoing benefit plan for six engineering
    employees.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company recorded
    an additional special charge of $3.4 million related to
    this reorganization action. Approximately $3.2 million
    relates to the severance and fringe benefit costs recorded
    pursuant to SFAS 88 under the Company’s ongoing
    benefit plan or minimum statutory requirements at foreign
    locations for 20 engineering and selling, marketing, general and
    administrative employees. The remaining $0.2 million of
    this charge was for lease obligation costs for a facility the
    Company ceased using during the second quarter of fiscal 2007.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company reversed
    approximately $0.9 million of the Company’s severance
    accrual because some employees voluntarily left the Company and
    other employees found alternative employment within the Company,
    and were therefore no longer entitled to severance payments.

The employment of all employees included in this action has been
    terminated. The Company does not expect to incur any further
    charges related to this reorganization action.

Fourth
    Quarter of Fiscal 2007 Special Charges

Consolidation
    of a Wafer Fabrication Facility in Limerick

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company recorded a
    special charge of $13.7 million as a result of the
    Company’s decision to focus the wafer fabrication capacity
    at its Limerick facility on eight-inch technology. Certain
    manufacturing processes and products produced on the six-inch
    production line will transition to the existing

eight-inch

production line in Limerick while others will transition to
    external foundries. The charge was for severance and fringe
    benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under the
    Company’s ongoing benefit plan for 150 manufacturing
    employees. Production is expected to cease in the six-inch wafer
    fabrication facility during the first half of fiscal year 2009,
    and the affected employees will be terminated. These employees
    must continue to be employed until their employment is
    involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance
    benefit. The Company expects to incur additional expenses
    related to this action during fiscal year 2009 of approximately
    $6 million related to clean-up and closure costs. In
    accordance with SFAS 146, these costs will be expensed as
    incurred.

Reduction
    of Overhead Infrastructure Costs

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company decided to
    either deemphasize or exit certain businesses or products and
    focus investments in products and end markets where the Company
    has better opportunities for profitable growth. In September
    2007, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell
    its Baseband Chipset Business. As a result of these decisions
    the Company decided to reduce the support infrastructure in
    manufacturing, engineering and SMG&A to more appropriately
    reflect the required overhead structure of the Company.
    Consequently, the Company recorded a special charge of
    $12.3 million, of which $10.7 million is for severance
    and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to SFAS 88 under
    the Company’s ongoing benefit plan or statutory
    requirements at foreign locations for 25 manufacturing employees
    and 127 engineering and selling, marketing, general and
    administrative employees. The remaining $1.6 million is for
    contract termination costs related to a license agreement
    associated with products the Company will no longer develop and
    for which there is no future alternative use. These actions are
    expected be substantially completed in the second quarter of
    fiscal 2008.

As of November 3, 2007, 77 of the 152 employees
    included in this reorganization action were still employed by
    the Company. These employees must continue to be employed until
    their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive
    the severance benefit.

Acquisitions

In the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company completed a
    transaction with TTPCom Limited (TTPCom), whereby TTPCom
    transferred to the Company intellectual property, engineering
    resources, and related assets associated with the support and
    customization of TTPCom’s GSM/GPRS/EDGE modem software for
    use on the Company’s existing and future generations of
    SoftFone

®

baseband processors. The Company also acquired development
    rights for AJAR, TTPCom’s advanced applications platform.
    As a result of this transaction, the Company became the single
    point of contact for both hardware and software support for its
    new and existing wireless handset customers, thus improving the
    Company’s abilities to service the needs of individual
    customers. The Company paid TTPCom $11.9 million in initial
    cash payments. The purchase price was allocated to the tangible
    and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair
    values at the date of acquisition. The estimated fair values of
    the assets exceeded the initial payments by $7.8 million,
    resulting in negative goodwill. Pursuant to Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141,

Business
    Combinations

, the Company recorded a liability for the
    contingent consideration that will be accounted for as
    additional purchase price, up to the amount of the negative
    goodwill. As contingent payments became due, the payments were
    applied against the contingent liability. As of October 28,
    2006, the Company had paid $6 million of contingent
    payments and the remaining contingent liability was
    $1.8 million. The purchase price included $5.5 million
    of in-process technology that had not yet reached technological
    feasibility, had no alternative future use and was charged to
    operations during the third quarter of fiscal 2006. The
    in-process technology related to software code developed for use
    in the Company’s semiconductor chipsets manufactured for
    devices that use both the 2G and 2.5G cellular wireless
    technology standards. The fair value of the in-process
    technology was determined with the assistance of a third party
    using the income approach. At the time of the acquisition, the
    in-process technology was approximately 56% complete. As of
    November 3, 2007, the in-process research and development
    projects were complete. During fiscal 2007, we paid an
    additional $6.1 million of contingent consideration, which
    resulted in reducing the $1.8 million liability and
    recording additional goodwill of $4.3 million. As of
    November 3, 2007, all technological milestones have been
    met and no additional payments will be made. The acquisition
    also included $13.2 million of intangible assets (see
    Note 2f.) that were being amortized over their estimated
    useful lives of five years using an accelerated amortization
    method that reflects the estimated pattern of economic use. As a
    result of the Company’s definitive agreement to sell its
    Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc., $7.9 million
    and $11.4 million of net intangible assets were
    reclassified to assets of discontinued operations at
    November 3, 2007 and October 28, 2006, respectively,
    as the TTPCom assets will be transferred to MediaTek Inc. as
    part of the transaction. See Note 2u. for additional
    information on assets of discontinued operations.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company acquired
    substantially all the outstanding stock of privately-held
    Integrant Technologies, Inc. (Integrant) of Seoul, Korea. The
    acquisition enabled the Company to enter the mobile TV market
    and strengthened its presence in the Asian region. The Company
    paid $127.2 million in initial cash payments at closing and
    may be obligated to make additional cash payments of up to an
    aggregate of $33 million upon the satisfaction of certain
    conditions. The initial cash payments included $4.2 million
    held in escrow for the purchase of the remaining non-founder
    outstanding shares. These shares were purchased during fiscal
    2007 and were recorded as additional goodwill. The purchase
    price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets
    acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of
    acquisition. The Company completed the final purchase accounting
    for this transaction during the first quarter of fiscal 2007,
    which resulted in an additional $5.6 million of goodwill.
    The $33 million of potential cash payments is comprised of
    $25 million for the achievement of revenue-based milestones
    that may be payable during the period from July 2006 through
    December 2007 and $8 million related to the purchase of
    shares from the founder of Integrant during the period from July
    2007 through July 2009. The additional cash payments will be
    recorded as additional purchase price. During fiscal 2007, the
    Company paid $3.5 million to repurchase founder shares. No
    revenue-based milestones have been met as of November 3,
    2007. The purchase price included $11.1 million of
    in-process technology that had not yet reached technological
    feasibility, had no alternative future use and was charged to
    operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The
    in-process technology related to technologies currently in
    development for Dual DAB, T-DMB,

DVB-H, RFID and WiBro applications. The fair value of
    the in-process technology was determined with the assistance of
    a third party using the income forecast approach. At the time of
    the acquisition, the in-process technology was approximately 74%
    complete. As of November 3, 2007, the in-process research
    and development projects were complete. The acquisition also
    included $21.6 million of intangible assets (see
    Note 2f.) that are being amortized over their estimated
    useful lives of two to five years using an accelerated
    amortization method that reflects the estimated pattern of
    economic use.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company acquired all
    the outstanding stock of privately-held AudioAsics A/S
    (AudioAsics) of Roskilde, Denmark. The acquisition of AudioAsics
    allows the Company to continue developing low-power audio
    solutions, while expanding its presence in the Nordic and
    Eastern European regions. The Company paid $19.3 million in
    initial cash payments at closing and may be obligated to make
    additional cash payments of up to an aggregate of
    $8 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The
    purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible
    assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date
    of acquisition. The $8 million of potential cash payments
    is comprised of $4.8 million for the achievement of
    revenue-based milestones that may be payable during the period
    from October 2006 through January 2009 and $3.2 million
    based on the achievement of technological milestones during the
    period from October 2006 through January 2009. In order to be
    entitled to receive $2.4 million of the revenue-based
    contingent consideration, certain key employees must continue to
    be employed by the Company. As such, that portion of the
    revenue-based contingent consideration will be recorded as
    compensation expense when, and if, it is earned. The
    technological milestones require post-acquisition services to be
    rendered in order to be achieved and, as such, will be recorded
    as compensation expense when earned. The purchase price included
    $5.1 million of in-process technology that had not yet
    reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use
    and was charged to operations during the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2006. The in-process technology related to technologies
    currently in development for analog and digital microphone

pre-amplifiers.

The fair value of the in-process technology was determined with
    the assistance of a third party using the income approach. At
    the time of the acquisition, the in-process technology was
    approximately 69% complete. As of November 3, 2007, the
    in-process research and development projects were complete. The
    acquisition also included $8.3 million of intangible assets
    (see Note 2f.) that are being amortized over their
    estimated useful lives of five years using an accelerated
    amortization method that reflects the estimated pattern of
    economic use. As of November 3, 2007, no contingent
    consideration has been paid.

Pro forma results of operations for TTPCom, Integrant and
    AudioAsics have not been provided herein as they were not
    material to the Company on either an individual or an aggregate
    basis. The results of operations of each acquisition are

Investments are offset by a corresponding liability to the plan
    participants (see Note 10). These investments are
    specifically designated as available to the Company solely for
    the purpose of paying benefits under the Company’s deferred
    compensation plan. However, in the event the Company became
    insolvent, the investments would be available to all unsecured
    general creditors.

During fiscal 2006, the Company distributed $254.1 million
    from its amended and restated deferred compensation plan, or the
    Deferred Compensation Plan, as a result of participant
    terminations or at the direction of the participants. This
    amount represented compensation

and/or

stock
    option gains previously deferred by those participants pursuant
    to the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan and earnings on
    those deferred amounts. As a result of certain provisions of the
    American Jobs Creation Act, participants had the opportunity
    until December 31, 2005 to elect to withdraw amounts
    previously deferred.

Other
    Investments

Other investments consist of equity securities and other
    long-term investments. Investments are stated at fair value,
    which is based on market quotes, or on a cost-basis, dependent
    on the nature of the investment, as appropriate. Adjustments to
    the fair value of investments classified as available-for-sale
    are recorded as an increase or decrease in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss), unless the adjustment is considered
    an other-than-temporary impairment, in which case the adjustment
    is recorded as a charge in the statement of income.

Realized gains of $7.9 million were recorded in fiscal 2007
    related to the sale of a cost-basis investment. There were no
    realized gains or losses recorded in fiscal 2006 or 2005.

Long-term marketable investments are classified as
    available-for-sale. Unrealized losses of $0.3 million
    ($0.2 million net of tax) were recorded in fiscal 2007,

Deferred
    Compensation Plan Liability and Other Noncurrent
    Liabilities

The deferred compensation plan liability relates to obligations
    due under the Analog Devices, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan
    (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”). The Deferred
    Compensation Plan allows certain members of management and other
    highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer
    receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. Prior to
    January 1, 2005, participants could also defer gains on
    stock options and restricted stock granted before July 23,
    1997. The balance represents Deferred Compensation Plan
    participant accumulated deferrals, and earnings thereon, since
    the inception of the Deferred Compensation Plan, net of
    withdrawals. The total expense to the Company of the Deferred
    Compensation Plan was $0.3 million in fiscal 2007,
    $1.0 million in fiscal 2006 and $9.9 million in fiscal
    2005. The Company’s liability under the Deferred
    Compensation Plan is an unsecured general obligation of the
    Company. Other noncurrent liabilities primarily relate to
    pension liabilities.

During fiscal 2006, the Company distributed $254.1 million
    from the Deferred Compensation Plan as a result of participant
    terminations or at the direction of the participants. This
    amount represented compensation

Tentative
    Settlement of the SEC’s Previously Announced Stock Option
    Investigation

In the Company’s 2004

Form 10-K

filing, the Company disclosed that the Securities and Exchange
    Commission (SEC) had initiated an inquiry into its stock option
    granting practices, focusing on options that were granted
    shortly before the issuance of favorable financial results. On
    November 15, 2005, the Company announced that it had
    reached a tentative settlement with the SEC.

At all times since receiving notice of this inquiry, the Company
    has cooperated with the SEC. In November 2005, the Company and
    its President and CEO, Mr. Jerald G. Fishman, made an offer
    of settlement to the Staff of the SEC. The settlement has been
    submitted to the Commission for approval. There can be no
    assurance a final settlement will be so approved.

The SEC’s inquiry focused on two separate issues. The
    first issue concerned the Company’s disclosure regarding
    grants of options to employees and directors prior to the
    release of favorable financial results. Specifically, the issue
    related to options granted to employees

(

including
    officers

)

of the Company on November 30, 1999 and to
    employees

(

including officers

)

and directors of
    the Company on November 10, 2000.

The second issue concerned the grant dates for options granted
    to employees

(

including officers

)

in 1998 and
    1999, and the grant date for options granted to employees
    (including officers

)

and directors in 2001. Specifically,
    the settlement would conclude that the appropriate grant date
    for the September 4, 1998 options should have been
    September 8th (which is one trading day later than the
    date that was used to price the options); the appropriate grant
    date for the November 30, 1999 options should have been
    November 29th (which is one trading day earlier than
    the date that was used); and the appropriate grant date for the
    July 18, 2001 options should have been
    July 26th (which is five trading days after the
    original date).



ANALOG
    DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In connection with the proposed settlement, the Company would
    consent to a

cease-and-desist

order under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act
    and

Rule 10b-5

thereunder, would pay a civil money penalty of $3 million,
    and would reprice options granted to Mr. Fishman in certain
    years. Options granted to all others would be excluded from the
    repricing. Mr. Fishman would consent to a

cease-and-desist

order under Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the
    Securities Act, would pay a civil money penalty of
    $1 million, and would make a disgorgement payment with
    respect to options granted in certain years. With the exception
    of options granted in 1998, Mr. Fishman has not exercised
    or sold any of the options identified in this matter. The
    Company and Mr. Fishman would settle this matter without
    admitting or denying the Commission’s findings.

The Company has determined that no restatement of its historical
    financial results would be necessary due to the proposed
    settlement.

Other
    Legal Proceedings

In May 2006, the Company received a document subpoena from the
    U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York
    requesting records from 2000 to the present relating to the
    Company’s granting of stock options. The Company believes
    that the options at issue in this matter are the same option
    grants which have been the subject of investigation by the SEC.
    The Company has cooperated with the office of the
    U.S. Attorney in connection with this subpoena. The Company
    cannot predict the outcome of this matter, but believes the
    disposition of the matter will not have a material adverse
    effect on the Company or its financial position.

On May 25, 2006, the Company filed a lawsuit in United
    States District Court for the District of Delaware against
    Linear Technology Corp., or LTC, alleging infringement of three
    Company patents by LTC’s making, selling and using various
    products. In the Company’s complaint, it is seeking damages
    in an unspecified amount and injunctive relief. In addition, the
    Company also sought a declaratory judgment that its products do
    not infringe eight patents allegedly owned by LTC (the “LTC
    patents”) and that the LTC patents are invalid. On
    July 28, 2006, LTC filed an answer and counterclaims,
    denying that its products infringe the asserted Company patents
    and asking the court to declare such patents invalid. LTC also
    claimed that the Company, by making, selling and using various
    power management products, is infringing seven of the eight LTC
    patents. LTC seeks damages in an unspecified amount and
    injunctive relief. On August 21, 2006, the Company filed
    its answer to LTC’s counterclaims, denying all liability to
    LTC. The case is currently in the discovery phase and trial is
    scheduled to begin in October 2008. The Company intends to
    vigorously pursue its claims against LTC, and to vigorously
    defend against LTC’s counterclaims. The Company is unable
    at this time to predict the outcome of this litigation; however,
    the Company believes that the final disposition of this matter
    will not have a material adverse effect on the Company or its
    financial position.

On October 13, 2006, a purported class action complaint was
    filed in the United States District Court for the District of
    Massachusetts on behalf of participants in the Company’s
    Investment Partnership Plan from October 5, 2000 to the
    present. The complaint named as defendants the Company, certain
    officers and directors, and the Company’s Investment
    Partnership Plan Administration Committee. The complaint alleges
    purported violations of federal law in connection with the
    Company’s option granting practices during the years 1998,
    1999, 2000, and 2001, including breaches of fiduciary duties
    owed to participants and beneficiaries of the Company’s
    Investment Partnership Plan under the Employee Retirement Income
    Security Act. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages,
    as well as equitable and injunctive relief. The Company intends
    to vigorously defend against these allegations. On
    November 22, 2006, the Company and the individual
    defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint. On
    January 8, 2007, the Plaintiff filed memoranda in
    opposition. On January 22, 2007, the Company and the
    individual defendants filed further memoranda in support of the

    meritorious defenses to the asserted claims, it is unable at
    this time to predict the outcome of this proceeding. The court
    has scheduled a hearing on the Company’s motion to dismiss
    on January 30, 2008.

From time to time in the ordinary course of the Company’s
    business, various claims, charges and litigation are asserted or
    commenced against the Company arising from, or related to,
    contractual matters, patents, trademarks,

personal injury, environmental matters, product liability,
    insurance coverage and personnel and employment disputes. As to
    such claims and litigation the Company can give no assurance
    that it will prevail.

While the Company does not believe that any of the matters
    described above will have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial position, an adverse outcome of any of
    these matters is possible and could have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations
    or cash flows in the quarter or annual period in which one or
    more of these matters are resolved.

Maxim
    Litigation Settlement

The Company executed a legal settlement with Maxim Integrated
    Products, Inc. (Maxim) during the second quarter of fiscal 2007,
    which resulted in the Company receiving $19 million. The
    Company recorded $8.5 million as a credit to legal expense
    in selling, marketing, general and administrative expense
    because this amount represents the fair value of external legal
    costs incurred by the Company in this matter. The remaining
    $10.5 million has been recorded in other income because the
    amount was not related to the reimbursement of external legal
    costs and management deems it to be an isolated event. This
    amount is earned in full because the Company has no future
    obligation to Maxim with respect to this payment.

14.

Retirement
    Plans

The Company and its subsidiaries have various savings and
    retirement plans covering substantially all employees. The
    Company maintains a defined contribution plan for the benefit of
    its eligible United States employees. This plan provides for
    Company contributions of up to 5% of each participant’s
    total eligible compensation. In addition, the Company
    contributes an amount equal to each participant’s pre-tax
    contribution, if any, up to a maximum of 3% of each
    participant’s total eligible compensation. The total
    expense related to the defined contribution plan for
    U.S. employees was $21.0 million in fiscal 2007,
    $22.1 million in fiscal 2006 and $21.6 million in
    fiscal 2005. The Company also has various defined benefit
    pension and other retirement plans for certain

non-U.S. employees

that are consistent with local statutory requirements and
    practices. The total expense related to the various defined
    benefit pension and other retirement plans for certain

non-U.S. employees

was $17.3 million in fiscal 2007, $15.7 million in
    fiscal 2006 and $12.1 million in fiscal 2005.

Effective for fiscal year 2007, the Company adopted the
    provisions of SFAS 158,

Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and other Postretirement
    Plans — an amendment of FASB Statement No. 87,
    88, 106 and 132(R)

(SFAS 158) in the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2007. SFAS 158 requires that the funded
    status of defined-benefit post retirement plans be recognized on
    the company’s consolidated balance sheets, and changes in
    the funded status be reflected in comprehensive income.
    SFAS 158 also requires the measurement date of the
    plan’s funded status to be the same as the company’s
    fiscal year end, which will be effective for the Company in
    fiscal 2009.

Non-U.S.

Plan Disclosures

The Company’s funding policy for its foreign defined
    benefit pension plans is consistent with the local requirements
    of each country. The plans’ assets consist primarily of
    U.S. and

non-U.S. equity

securities, bonds, property and cash. The benefit obligations
    and related assets under these plans have been measured at
    September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006.

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit
    obligation, and fair value of plan assets for

non-U.S. pension

plans with accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan
    assets were $46.4 million, $40.1 million, and
    $24.3 million respectively, at September 30, 2007 and
    $49.6 million, $41.9 million, and $24.2 million
    respectively, at September 30, 2006.

The range of assumptions used for the

non-U.S. defined

benefit plans reflects the different economic environments
    within the various countries. The projected benefit obligation
    was determined using the following weighted average assumptions:



Discount rate

5.64

%

4.79

%

Rate of increase in compensation levels

3.83

%

3.70

%

Expected long-term return on plan assets

7.14

%

6.71

%

The expected long-term rate of return on assets is a weighted
    average of the long-term rates of return selected for the
    various countries where the Company has funded pension plans.
    The expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption is
    selected based on the facts and circumstances that exist as of
    the measurement date, and the specific portfolio mix of plan
    assets. Management, in conjunction with its actuaries, reviewed
    anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset
    categories and considered the asset allocation strategy adopted
    by the Company and or the trustees of the plans. While the
    review considered recent fund performance and historical
    returns, the assumption is primarily a long-term, prospective
    rate.

The fundamental goal underlying the pension plans’
    investment policy is to achieve a total rate of return that
    exceeds inflation over the long-term by using a certain mix of
    assets depending on the profile of the specific plan. Investment
    practices must comply with applicable laws and regulations.

The Company’s investment strategy is based on an
    expectation that equity securities will outperform debt
    securities over the long term. Accordingly, in order to maximize
    the return on assets, a majority of assets are invested in
    equities. Investments within each asset class are diversified to
    reduce the impact of losses in single investments. The use of
    derivative instruments is permitted where appropriate and
    necessary to achieve overall investment policy objectives and
    asset class targets.

The Company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage
    targets and appropriate benchmarks for each significant asset
    class to obtain a prudent balance between return and risk. The
    interaction between plan assets and benefit obligations is
    periodically studied by the Company and its actuaries to assist
    in the establishment of strategic asset allocation targets.

On October 22, 2004, the U.S. enacted the American

    temporary incentive for U.S. multinational corporations to
    repatriate accumulated foreign income by providing an 85%
    dividends received deduction for certain dividends from
    controlled foreign corporations. The Company

decided to repatriate $1,055 million in extraordinary
    dividends, as defined by the AJCA, during the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2005 and accordingly recorded a tax liability of
    $48.7 million at October 29, 2005.

The Company continues to intend to reinvest certain of its
    foreign earnings indefinitely. Accordingly, no US income taxes
    have been provided for approximately $1,193 million of
    unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries. As of
    November 3, 2007, the amount of unrecognized deferred tax
    liability on these earnings was $323 million.

The Company has provided for potential liabilities due in
    various jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining the
    worldwide income tax expense provision. In the ordinary course
    of global business, there are many transactions and calculations
    where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these
    uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement
    arrangements among related entities. Although the Company
    believes its estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given
    that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be
    different than that which is reflected in the historical income
    tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a
    material impact on the Company’s income tax provision and
    operating results in the period in which such determination is
    made.



ANALOG

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During fiscal year 2006, the United States Internal Revenue
    Service (the IRS) completed its examination of fiscal years
    2001, 2002 and 2003 and issued their report. The Company agreed
    to accept this report and filed its 2005 and 2006 tax return and
    an amended return for 2004 conforming to the methodologies
    agreed to during the

2001-2003

examination. The completion of this examination, including the
    reversal of accruals for taxes and penalties and the filing of
    refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the
    completion of the IRS examination, resulted in an income tax
    benefit of $35.2 million in fiscal year 2006.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, the IRS completed
    its field examination of fiscal years 2004 and 2005. Although
    the IRS has not issued its final report for fiscal 2004 and
    2005, they have issued proposed adjustments related to these two
    fiscal years. The Company has provided $4.4 million for
    taxes and penalties related to certain of these proposed
    adjustments. There are four items, with a potential total tax
    liability of $46 million, that the Company concluded, based
    on discussions with its tax advisors, are not likely to result
    in additional tax liability. Therefore, the Company has not
    recorded any tax liability for these items and plans to appeal
    these proposed adjustments through the normal processes for the
    resolution of differences between the IRS and taxpayers. Two of
    the unresolved matters are one-time issues and pertain to
    Section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code related to the
    beneficial tax treatment of dividends from foreign owned
    companies under The American Jobs Creation Act. The other
    matters pertain to the computation of research and development
    tax credits and the profits earned from manufacturing activities
    carried on outside the United States. As well as impacting taxes
    payable for fiscal 2004 and 2005, these latter two matters could
    impact taxes payable in subsequent years.

During fiscal year 2006, the IRS invited the Company to
    participate in the Compliance Assurance Process (CAP), which is
    a voluntary pilot program the IRS is conducting for a limited
    number of large business taxpayers. The objective of CAP is to
    reduce taxpayer burden associated with IRS audits while assuring
    the IRS of the accuracy of tax returns prior to filing. The
    Company has agreed to participate in CAP. Under the program, the
    IRS is expected to contemporaneously work with the Company to
    achieve federal tax compliance and resolve issues prior to the
    filing of a tax return. CAP is designed to eliminate or
    substantially reduce the need for post-filing examinations of
    future tax returns. For fiscal 2006, the IRS has completed the
    CAP. The IRS and the Company have agreed on the treatment of a
    number of issues that have been included in an Issue Resolutions
    Agreement related to the 2006 tax return. However, no agreement
    was reached on the tax treatment of a number of issues,
    including the same R&D credit and foreign manufacturing
    issues mentioned above related to fiscal 2004 and 2005. The IRS
    has also indicated they plan to audit the pricing of inter
    company sales (transfer pricing), which is just beginning. The
    Company has not provided for any additional taxes in respect to
    the examination of the fiscal 2006 return. The CAP is still
    underway for fiscal 2007. The Company has not prepared its tax
    return for fiscal 2007, and the IRS has not issued a report for
    fiscal 2007.

Although the Company believes its estimates of tax payable are
    reasonable, no assurance can be given that the Company will
    prevail in the matters raised related to the fiscal years 2004,
    2005, and 2006 and that the outcome of one or all of these
    matters will not be different than that which is reflected in
    the historical income tax provisions and accruals. The Company
    believes such differences would not have a material impact on
    the Company’s financial condition but could have a material
    impact on the Company’s income tax provision, operating
    results and operating cash flows in the period in which such
    matters are resolved.

Related
    Party Transactions

One of the Company’s directors, who has served on the
    Company’s Board of Directors since 1988, became a director
    of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, in
    fiscal 2002 and continues to serve as a director of TSMC.
    Management believes the terms and prices for the purchases of
    products from TSMC are not affected by the presence of one of
    the Company’s directors on the Board of Directors of TSMC.
    The Company purchased approximately $302 million,
    $281 million and $224 million of product from TSMC in
    fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and
    approximately $47 million and $17 million was payable
    to TSMC as of

Gain on
    Sale of Product Line

During fiscal 2006, the Company completed the sale to Ikanos
    Communications, Inc. of its DSP-based digital subscriber line
    (DSL) application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and network
    processor product line. The Company received approximately
    $23.1 million in cash for the product line and after
    providing for the write-off of inventory, fixed assets and other
    costs incurred to complete the transaction, recorded a net gain
    of $13.0 million in nonoperating income during fiscal 2006.

Subsequent
    Events

On November 8, 2007, the Company entered into a purchase
    and sale agreement with certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor
    Corporation to sell the Company’s CPU voltage regulation
    and PC thermal monitoring business for total consideration of
    approximately $185 million. The business to be sold
    consists of core voltage regulator products for the central
    processing unit in computing and gaming applications and
    temperature sensors and fan-speed controllers for managing the
    temperature of the central processing unit. The parties will
    also enter into a one-year manufacturing supply arrangement. The
    Company expects to close this transaction in the first quarter
    of fiscal 2008. This business met the assets held for sale
    criteria on November 8, 2007, and will therefore be
    reclassified to discontinued operations during the first quarter
    of fiscal 2008.

The following table presents the items that will be reclassified

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Analog Devices, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Analog Devices, Inc. as of November 3, 2007 and
    October 28, 2006, and the related consolidated statements
    of income, shareholders’ equity, comprehensive income, and
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    November 3, 2007. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(c). These
    financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Analog Devices, Inc. at November 3,
    2007 and October 28, 2006, and the consolidated results of
    its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended November 3, 2007, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
    information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 14 to the financial statements,
    effective November 3, 2007, the Company adopted Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).

Additionally, as discussed
    in Note 2s to the financial statements, effective
    October 30, 2005, the Company adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),

Share-Based
    Payment

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of Analog Devices, Inc.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of November 3, 2007, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission and our report dated November 26, 2007
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

(a)

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
    Procedures.

Our management, with the
    participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of Analog’s disclosure
    controls and procedures as of November 3, 2007. The term
    “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a
    company that are designed to ensure that information required to
    be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or
    submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
    the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
    procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
    designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
    a company in the reports that it files or submits under the
    Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
    company’s management, including its principal executive and
    principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely
    decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes
    that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
    and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
    their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment
    in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
    and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures as of November 3, 2007 our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as
    of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were
    effective at the reasonable assurance level.

(b)

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal
    control over financial reporting is defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

or

15d-15(f)

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers and effected by the company’s board of directors,
    management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
    regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
    preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
    includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of the company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
    that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
    only in accordance with authorizations of management and
    directors of the company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
    are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting as of November 3, 2007. In
    making this assessment, the company’s management used the
    criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
    of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated
    Framework.

Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of
    November 3, 2007, our internal control over financial
    reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Our independent auditors have issued an audit report on our
    assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.
    This report appears below.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Analog Devices, Inc.

We have audited Analog Devices, Inc.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of November 3, 2007, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Analog Devices,
    Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    management’s report on internal control over financial
    reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Analog Devices, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of November 3, 2007, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Analog Devices, Inc. as of
    November 3, 2007 and October 28, 2006, and the related
    consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity,
    comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years
    in the period ended November 3, 2007 of Analog Devices,
    Inc. and our report dated November 26, 2007 expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

No
    change in our internal control over financial reporting (as
    defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act) occurred during
    the fiscal quarter ended November 3, 2007 that has
    materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
