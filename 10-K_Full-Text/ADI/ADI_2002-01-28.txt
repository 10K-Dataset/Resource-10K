ITEM
1.     BUSINESS

Company Overview

We are a world leader in the design, manufacture
and marketing of high-performance analog, mixed-signal and
digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits (ICs) used
in signal processing applications.

We produce a wide range of products that meet the
technology needs of a broad base of customers and markets.
Markets and applications for our products include
communications, computers and computer peripherals, consumer
electronics, industrial, instrumentation, military and space
systems and automotive electronics.

During fiscal 2001, approximately 38% of our
revenues came from the communications market. Over the past few
years, this market has been our fastest-growing served market.
Communications applications include wireless handsets and base
stations, as well as products used for high-speed access to the
Internet, including ICs used in ADSL and cable modems and
central office networking equipment.

We serve the PC market with products that monitor
and manage power usage, process signals used in flat panel
displays and multimedia projectors and enable PCs to provide
CD-quality audio. We also serve the high-end consumer market
with ICs used in products such as digital cameras and
camcorders, DVD players and surround sound audio systems. During
fiscal 2001, approximately 22% of our revenues were derived from
the computer and consumer markets.

We serve the industrial market by providing
products for data acquisition systems, automatic process control
systems, robotics, environmental control systems and automatic
test equipment. We also provide products to the instrumentation
market for use in engineering, medical and scientific
instruments. During fiscal 2001, approximately 40% of our
revenue came from the industrial market.

We sell our products worldwide through a direct
sales force, third-party industrial distributors and independent
sales representatives. We have direct sales offices in 19
countries, including the United States.

We are headquartered near Boston, in Norwood,
Massachusetts, and have manufacturing facilities in
Massachusetts, California, North Carolina, Ireland, the United
Kingdom, the Philippines and Taiwan. Founded in 1965, we employ
approximately 9,000 people worldwide. Our stock is listed on the
New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ADI and is included in
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.

Industry Background

Real-world phenomena, such as temperature,
pressure, sound, images, speed and acceleration, are analog by
nature, consisting of continuously varying information. This
information can be detected and measured using analog sensors,
which represent real-world phenomena by generating continuously
varying voltages and currents. The signals from these sensors
are initially processed using analog methods, such as
amplification, filtering and shaping. They are then usually
converted to digital form for storage, display or further
manipulation. The further manipulation of the signals after
conversion to digital form is called “digital signal
processing,” or DSP. Digital signals are frequently
converted back to analog form for functions such as analog
display, audio output or control. These manipulations and
transformations along this signal chain are collectively known
as “real-world signal processing.”

Significant advances in semiconductor technology
in recent years have substantially increased the performance and
functionality of ICs used in signal processing applications.
These advances include the ability to combine analog and digital
signal processing capability on a single chip, thereby making
possible much more highly integrated solutions. The convergence
of computing and communications requires end products that
incorporate state-of-the-art signal processing capability onto
as few chips as possible. Our products are used as components in
equipment and systems to achieve higher performance, including
greater speed, improved accuracy, more efficient signal
processing, and minimized power consumption.



Principal Products

We are engaged in the design, manufacture and
marketing of a broad line of high-performance ICs that
incorporate analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing
technologies that address a wide range of real-world signal
processing applications. We produce and market several thousand
products. Our highest revenue product accounted for
approximately 2% of our revenue for fiscal 2001. Many of our
products are proprietary and equivalent products are available
only from a limited number of other suppliers. We also design,
manufacture and market a limited range of assembled products.

Markets and Applications

The following describes some of the
characteristics of, and products supplied to, each of our major
markets:

Communications

—
The development of broadband, wireless and Internet
infrastructures around the world has created an important market
for our communications products. Communications technology
involves the acquisition of analog signals that are converted
from analog to digital and digital to analog form as they are
processed and transmitted. Our expertise in combining analog and
digital functionality on a single chip or chip set has enabled
us to develop products that fulfill the technological challenges
of this complex and rapidly expanding market space. The need for
ever higher speed and reduced power consumption, coupled with
more reliable, more bandwidth-efficient communications, is
creating increasing demand for our products, which are used in
systems that include digital, analog and mixed-signal processing
capability. Our products are used in the full spectrum of signal
processing for audio, data, image or video communication. In
broadband and wireless communication applications, our products
are incorporated into data and digital subscriber line
(DSL) modems, cellular telephones, base station equipment
and remote access servers. We are also developing micromachined
products for use in optical networks.

Computers and Computer
Peripherals

— Increased
interface between users and PCs through monitors, printers,
scanners and audio devices and the increasing need for power and
thermal management capability in PCs have provided many
opportunities in the computer market. Our ability to integrate
analog, DSP and mixed-signal functionality on ICs has enabled us
to supply many high performance critical components required by
PC manufacturers. The computer industry seeks to develop
and market ever smaller and lighter personal computers. This
need increases demand for high performance ICs to monitor power
usage to enable manufacturers to use smaller batteries and
extend battery life between charges. We currently supply a
variety of ICs used in this market for functions such as graphic
displays, interfaces between PCs and peripherals such as modems
and printers, power and battery management, and enhanced audio
input and output capability for business and entertainment
applications.

Consumer
Electronics

— Increased
market demand for acquisition, display and digital processing of
signals has allowed us to combine analog and digital design
capability to provide solutions that meet the rigorous cost,
size and reliability constraints of the consumer electronics
market. The emergence of high-performance feature-rich consumer
products, such as home sound systems, video projectors, DVD
players and digital camcorders and cameras, has led to the need
for high-performance system-level ICs with a high level of
specific functionality.

Industrial

—
Our industrial market includes data acquisition systems,
automatic process control systems, robotics, environmental
control systems and automatic test equipment. These products
generally require ICs that offer performance greater than that
available from commodity-level ICs, but generally do not have
production volumes that warrant custom or application-specific
ICs. Combinations of analog and mixed-signal ICs are usually
employed to achieve the necessary functionality. Automatic test
equipment applications have created opportunities for the design
of system-level ICs that require a high level of electronic
circuitry.

Instrumentation

—
Our instrumentation market includes engineering, medical and
scientific instruments. These products are usually designed
using the highest performance analog and mixed-signal ICs
available. Production volumes in this space generally do not
warrant custom or application-specific ICs.



Military/
Aerospace

— The
military, commercial avionics and space markets all require
high-performance ICs that meet rigorous environmental and
reliability specifications. Nearly all of our analog ICs can be
supplied in versions that meet appropriate military standards.
In addition, many products can be supplied to meet the standards
required for broadcast satellites and other commercial space
applications. Most of our products sold in this market are
derived from standard commercial grade ICs.

Automotive

—
Although the automotive market has historically been served with
low-cost, low-performance ICs, demand has emerged for higher
performance devices for a wide range of applications. In
response, we are developing products specifically for the
automotive market. We supply a micromachined IC used as a crash
sensor in airbag systems, which serves as an alternative to an
electromechanical sensor. We believe that other micromachined
devices derived from this product may be suitable for other
automotive applications, such as roll-over sensing, global
positioning satellite (GPS) automotive navigation systems,
anti-lock brakes and “smart” suspension systems and
non-automotive applications including earthquake detectors and
high-end computer joysticks.

Research and Development

Our markets are characterized by rapid
technological changes and advances. Accordingly, we make
substantial investments in the design and development of new
products and processes, and for significant improvement of
existing products and processes. We spent $465 million
during fiscal 2001 related to the design, development and
improvement of new and existing products and processes, compared
to $390 million spent during fiscal 2000 and
$253 million spent during fiscal 1999.

In support of our research and development
activities, we employ hundreds of engineers involved in product
and process development at several design centers and
manufacturing sites located throughout the world.

As of November 3, 2001, we owned
approximately 662 U.S. patents and had 318 patent
applications on file with the United States patent office. We
believe that while our patents may provide some advantage, our
competitive position is largely determined by such factors as
the system and application knowledge, ability and experience of
our personnel, the range and number of new products being
developed, our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing
efforts, customer service and technical support.

IC Products

Analog
Products

Our analog IC technology has been the foundation
of our business for more than 25 years, and we believe we
are one of the world’s largest suppliers of analog ICs. Our
analog ICs are primarily high-performance, single-function
devices. The majority of our analog IC product revenue is
attributable to sales of data converters (analog-to-digital and
digital-to-analog) and amplifiers. Other analog IC products we
offer include analog signal processing devices (such as analog
multipliers), voltage references and comparators. Over the past
few years we have been expanding our analog IC product offerings
along the entire analog signal chain and into product areas
where our focus was previously limited, principally interface
circuits and power management ICs. We are also expanding our
analog IC product line to better meet the needs of customers
designing portable battery-operated equipment.

Our analog IC products tend to be general purpose
in nature. This allows customers to incorporate them into a wide
variety of equipment and systems. Our product portfolio includes
several hundred analog ICs, any one of which can have as many as
several hundred customers. Analog ICs typically have long
product life cycles. Our analog IC customers include both
original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and customers who build
equipment for their own use. Most of our analog ICs have been
purchased by OEMs to serve the instrumentation, industrial and
military/ aerospace markets, but during the past few years they
have been increasingly used for applications in communications,
computers, camcorders, scanners, automatic test equipment,
imaging and other consumer applications requiring
high-performance real-world signal processing. By using
standard, high-performance, readily available, off-the-shelf
components in their designs, our



customers can reduce the time they need to
develop and bring new products to market. Given the high cost of
developing customized ICs, analog ICs usually provide the most
cost-effective solution for low to medium volume applications.
In addition, combinations of analog ICs connected together on a
printed circuit board can provide functionality not currently
achievable using a single IC.

Other analog ICs include circuits that are
designed to serve the needs of particularly demanding
applications, such as very high speed analog timing and pin
driver circuits needed by OEMs in the automatic test equipment
business. Manufacturers of portable instrumentation need analog
ICs designed to address demanding battery life requirements, and
need similar kinds of functions available in analog IC products
integrated into a single, very low-power chip. Other principal
requirements include higher accuracy, lower cost per function,
smaller size, lower weight and fewer components for improved
reliability. These application-specific products allow our
customers to design smaller, lighter, higher performance, more
power-efficient and lower-cost end products. We believe that
these benefits have become more important to our OEM customers
as they increase their focus on high-performance, small,
lightweight products, many of which are battery-powered.

General Purpose
DSP Products

Our DSP products are designed to efficiently
execute specialized software programs
(algorithms) associated with processing digitized
real-time, real-world data. General-purpose DSP IC customers
typically write their own algorithms using software tools that
we provide and software tools they obtain from third-party
suppliers. All of these devices share a common architecture that
allows system designers to address cost, performance and
time-to-market constraints. We support these products with
specialized applications and easy-to-use, low-cost design tools,
which reduce product development costs and time to market.

Mixed-Signal
Products

Our products also include multi-function
mixed-signal devices that incorporate combinations of analog and
digital technology. The growing need to allow user interface
with computers and consumer products as well as the development
of communications systems has created new opportunities for
these mixed-signal devices. Examples of these devices include
chipsets for communication applications (GSM cellular phones,
remote access servers, data and fax modems), audio input/output
devices and power and thermal management devices for computer
applications and electric motor control devices.

Micromachined
Products

Our technology base includes a number of new
products using an advanced IC technology known in the industry
as surface micromachining. This technology enables extremely
small mechanical structures to be built on the surface of a chip
along with supporting circuitry. In addition to incorporating an
electro-mechanical structure, these devices also have analog
circuitry for conditioning signals obtained from the
micromachined sensing element.

Our micromachined products are accelerometers
used in a wide variety of applications. The majority of current
revenue from micromachined products is derived from
accelerometers used by automotive manufacturers in airbag
applications. Emerging applications include GPS automobile
navigation systems, earthquake detectors and high-end computer
joysticks. We are also engaged in the development of
micromachined products for use in all-optical switching elements
in optical networks.

General Purpose
and Custom Products

Across the entire range of ICs that we design and
manufacture are general purpose products as well as custom
products designed for specific applications for specific
customers. In many of the new emerging markets in
communications, computer and consumer products, there is a
tendency to work with selected major customers to design
application-specific solutions which can combine elements of
analog, digital, mixed-signal and micromachined functionality.



Assembled Products

Our assembled products include multi-chip modules
(MCMs), hybrids and printed circuit board modules. An MCM is a
device made up of several IC chips assembled in an automated
fashion in a multilayer package that provides high interconnect
density at low cost. A hybrid consists of several chips and
discrete components mounted and wired together on a substrate,
which is then enclosed in a package. A printed-board module
consists of surface-mount components assembled on a small
printed board that is then encapsulated in a small plastic case.

Revenues from this product group have been
declining for several years, primarily because hybrids are being
replaced in many new designs with smaller, lower-cost monolithic
ICs that offer higher levels of performance and integration.
Sales of these products are approximately 3% of our total sales.

Sales Channels

We sell our products in North America and
internationally through a direct sales force, third-party
distributors and independent sales representatives.
Approximately 39% of our fiscal 2001 net sales were to customers
in North America. As of December 1, 2001, we had 12 sales
offices in the United States, and our third-party distribution
channel consisted of six national and regional third-party
distributors and several independent sales representatives in
numerous locations throughout the U.S. and Canada.

Approximately 24% of our fiscal 2001 net sales
were to customers in Europe, 15% to customers in Japan, and 22%
to customers in other international markets. As of
December 1, 2001, we had direct sales offices in Australia,
Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong
Kong, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands,
Singapore, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. We also had
sales representatives and/or distributors in approximately
46 countries outside North America, including countries
where we also have direct sales offices. For further detail
regarding geographic information, see Note 4 in the Notes to our
Consolidated Financial Statements included as part of this
report.

A significant portion of our fiscal 2001 revenue
was derived from sales made through distributors. These
distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products.
Some of them also sell products competitive with our products,
including those for which we are an alternate source. Sales to
certain distributors are made under agreements that provide
protection to the distributors for their inventory of our
products against price reductions and products that are
slow-moving or that we have discontinued.

Our worldwide technical direct field sales
efforts are supported by an extensive promotional program that
includes editorial coverage and paid advertising in trade
publications, direct mail programs, promotional brochures,
technical seminars and participation in trade shows. We publish
and distribute full-length databooks, short-form catalogs,
applications guides, technical handbooks and detailed data
sheets for individual products. We also provide product and
application information and sell products via our worldwide web
site on the Internet. We maintain a staff of field application
engineers who aid customers in incorporating our products into
their products during their product development cycles.

For fiscal 2001, our 20 largest customers
accounted for approximately 30% of our net sales. The largest
single customer represented approximately 3% of net sales.

Production and Raw Materials

Monolithic integrated circuit components are
manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps
that include wafer fabrication, wafer testing, cutting the wafer
into individual “chips” (or dice), assembly of the
dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in
final packaged form. The raw materials used to manufacture these
devices include silicon wafers, processing chemicals (including
liquefied gases), precious metals, ceramic packages and plastic
used for packaging.

We develop and employ a wide variety of
proprietary processes that are specifically tailored for use in
fabricating high-performance linear, mixed-signal and
system-level ICs. We also use industry-standard bipolar and CMOS
wafer fabrication processes.



Our IC products are fabricated both at our
production facilities and by third-party wafer fabricators. We
rely primarily on our own facilities for fabricating wafers that
require linear and mixed-signal processes. We operate wafer
fabrication facilities in Wilmington and Cambridge,
Massachusetts; Santa Clara and Sunnyvale, California; Belfast,
Northern Ireland and Limerick, Ireland. We also operate assembly
and test facilities located in Ireland, the Philippines and
Taiwan and also use third-party subcontractors. We have
agreements with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company,
(TSMC), and Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Pte.,
Ltd., (CSM), for the production of digital and very large scale
integration mixed-signal devices. To provide access to advanced
process technology at competitive costs, we participated in the
formation of a joint venture (WaferTech, LLC) with TSMC, Altera,
Integrated Silicon Solutions and several individual investors
that built a fabrication facility for eight-inch wafers in
Camas, Washington. Originally we had an 18% equity ownership in
WaferTech. In fiscal 1999, we sold 78% of our investment to
other WaferTech partners in exchange for $105 million in
cash, which was equal to 78% of the carrying value of the equity
ownership at October 31, 1998. During the first quarter of
fiscal 2001, we completed the sale of our remaining investment
in WaferTech, LLC to TSMC for approximately $61 million in
cash. We recorded a pretax realized gain on the sale of this
investment of approximately $28 million.

Hybrid products are manufactured by mounting and
connecting together several integrated circuit chips in a single
package. We manufacture some of the chips used in our hybrids,
and purchase others from outside suppliers. The production
process for modular components, subsystems and systems consists
primarily of assembly, packaging and testing. Some of our
assembled products are assembled and tested within our U.S.
manufacturing facilities and at U.S. subcontractors, while
others are assembled and tested at our facilities outside the
United States or by subcontractors, principally in the Far East.

To respond to production capacity requirements,
we significantly expanded our manufacturing capacity over the
past several years. Major wafer fabrication expansions were
completed in Wilmington, Massachusetts, Sunnyvale, California,
and Limerick, Ireland. In fiscal 2001, we completed construction
of an additional assembly and test facility in Cavite,
Philippines. We expect that our capital expenditures for fiscal
2002 will be approximately $70 million compared to
$297 million in fiscal 2001.

Backlog

Backlog at the end of fiscal 2001 was
approximately $210 million, down from approximately
$1,062 million at the end of fiscal 2000. We define backlog
as firm orders with a customer requested delivery date within
thirteen weeks. While backlog has declined primarily as a result
of the lower demand for our products from the year earlier
period, it has also been impacted by the tendency of customers
to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers,
including us, in periods of depressed demand. In periods of
increased demand, there is a tendency towards longer lead times
that has the effect of increasing backlog and, in some
instances, we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to
fulfill all orders. As is customary in the semiconductor
industry, we allow orders to be canceled or deliveries delayed
by customers without penalty. Accordingly, we believe that our
backlog at any time should not be used as an indication of
future revenues.

Government Contracts

We estimate that approximately 4% of our fiscal
2001 total worldwide revenue was attributable to sales to the
U.S. government and government contractors and
subcontractors. Our government contract business is
predominantly in the form of negotiated, firm fixed-price
subcontracts. All such contracts and subcontracts contain
standard provisions relating to termination at the election of
the United States government.

Competition

We compete with a large number of semiconductor
companies in markets that are highly competitive. We believe we
are one of the largest suppliers of high-performance linear and
mixed-signal signal-processing components. Competitors for our
analog, mixed-signal and DSP products include Cirrus Logic Inc.,
Linear Technology Corp., Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.,
Motorola Semiconductor Products, National Semiconductor Corp.,
Phillips Semiconductor, ST Microelectronics and Texas
Instruments, Inc. Sales of our



micromachined products are currently comprised of
acceleration sensors, and our main competitors are Bosch,
Motorola and Denso, which use a multichip solution. We use a
single chip solution that we believe provides cost, reliability
and functional advantages in the marketplace.

Many other companies offer products that compete
with our products. Some also offer other electronic products,
and some have financial resources substantially larger than
ours. Also, some formerly independent competitors have been
purchased by larger companies.

We believe that competitive performance in the
marketplace for real-world signal-processing components depends
upon several factors, including product price, technical
innovation, product quality and reliability, range of products,
customer service and technical support. We believe our
aggressive technical innovation emphasizing product performance
and reliability, supported by our commitment to strong customer
service and technical support, enables us to continue to compete
successfully in our chosen markets against both foreign and
domestic semiconductor manufacturers.

Environment

Our manufacturing facilities are subject to
numerous environmental laws and regulations, particularly with
respect to industrial waste and emissions. Compliance with these
laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our
capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

Employees

As of November 3, 2001, we employed
approximately 9,000 persons. Our future success depends in large
part on the continued service of our key technical and senior
management personnel, and on our ability to continue to attract,
retain and motivate qualified employees, particularly those
highly skilled design, process and test engineers involved in
the manufacture of existing products and the development of new
products and processes. The competition for such personnel is
intense, and the loss of key employees could have a material
adverse effect on us. We believe that relations with our
employees are good.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
	FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations

Net sales were $2,277 million in fiscal
2001, a decrease of 12% from net sales of $2,578 million in
fiscal 2000. The decrease in net sales was attributable to
declining demand in several markets that we serve, particularly
the communications market, as well as an overall decline in the
general economy. Fiscal 2001 analog IC product sales decreased
3% from fiscal 2000. Our analog IC product sales were strong in
the first half of the year and declined in line with a major
downturn in the semiconductor industry that occurred during the
last half of fiscal 2001. Our fiscal 2001 DSP IC product sales
decreased 32% from the prior year due to order cancellations and
adjustments, particularly from telecommunications customers and
contract manufacturers. Sales of new products, which we define
as sales of products introduced in the prior six quarters, were
19% of net sales in fiscal 2001 as compared with 25% in fiscal
2000. The year over year decrease in new products as a
percentage of sales was primarily due to the sharp downturn in
sales of our communications products.

Net sales were $2,578 million in fiscal
2000, an increase of 78% over net sales of $1,450 million
in fiscal 1999. This increase in net sales was attributable to
continued growth in the markets we serve. Sales into all end
markets increased in fiscal 2000 with the communications market
representing the largest growth area.

The percentage of sales by geographic region for
the last three years is as follows:

As set forth above, the fiscal 2001 decline in
North American sales as a percentage of total sales was
principally attributable to an overall decline in the
communications market as well as a cyclical downturn in the
semiconductor industry. Sales to international regions remained
strong in the first half of fiscal 2001 but weakened in the
latter half of the year due to the downturn in the semiconductor
industry. In absolute dollar terms, sales to Europe increased by
10% in fiscal 2001. Sales in fiscal 2001 to Japan remained
relatively flat to fiscal 2000 as both a percentage of sales and
in absolute dollar terms. Fiscal 2001 sales to Southeast Asia
remained flat as a percentage of sales as compared to fiscal
2000 while declining approximately 13% in absolute dollars. In
fiscal 2000, sales to Europe declined as a percentage of total
sales largely due to a weakening Euro/ U.S. dollar exchange rate
over fiscal 1999. In absolute dollars, fiscal 2000 net sales
increased over fiscal 1999 by 72% in North America, 61% in
Europe, 75% in Japan and 114% in Southeast Asia. These large
sales increases were due to high growth in end market demand
that was not sustainable.

Gross margin was $1,269 million, or 55.7% of
net sales, in fiscal 2001 compared to $1,461 million, or
56.7% of net sales, in fiscal 2000. Gross margin declined by 100
basis points from the prior year due to reduced revenue levels,
the impact of inventory reserves and low utilization of our
internal fabs. The increase in gross margin in fiscal 2000 to
56.7% from the 49.3% achieved in fiscal 1999 was due primarily
to the favorable effect of fixed costs being allocated across a
higher sales base and improved manufacturing efficiencies as
production increased at our wafer fabrication, assembly and test
facilities. Gross margin declined to 52% in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2001 as a result of a 47% sales decline in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2001 as compared to the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2000.

Research and development (R&D) expense
amounted to $465 million in fiscal 2001, an increase of
$75 million over fiscal 2000. Additional expenses
associated with increased engineering headcount were the main
reason for the year over year increase. As a result of the
decline in the year to year revenue, R&D spending as a
percentage of sales increased to 20.4% from 15.1% in fiscal
2000. At any point in time we have hundreds of R&D projects
underway, and we believe that none of these projects is material
on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of
innovative technologies and processes for new products and we
believe that a continued commitment to research and development
is essential in order to maintain product



leadership with our existing products and to
provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore we
expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in
the future. In fiscal 2000, R&D expense increased to
$390 million from $253 million in fiscal 1999.

Amortization of intangibles was $53 million
for fiscal 2001 compared with $11 million for fiscal 2000.
The increase in amortization expense was attributable to the
amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of
BCO Technologies plc in the third quarter of fiscal 2000,
and the acquisition of Thomas Neuroth AG, Signal Processing
Associates Pty. Ltd., Integrated Micro Instruments, Inc.,
ChipLogic, Inc. and Staccato Systems, Inc. completed in the
first quarter of fiscal 2001.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we
completed the following acquisitions:



•

On January 16, 2001, we acquired Staccato
	Systems, Inc. (Staccato) of Mountain View, California. The total
	purchase price of $23.8 million consisted of
	$23 million in cash and the assumption of $0.8 million
	of outstanding Staccato stock options. Additional contingent
	cash consideration of up to $7 million is payable if
	certain operational objectives are achieved and will be
	accounted for as additional goodwill. Approximately
	$1.8 million of the contingent consideration has been paid
	as of November 3, 2001. Staccato is in the field of audio
	synthesis technology.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2000, we
acquired BCO Technologies plc (BCO), a company with
operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in a cash-for-stock
transaction valued at approximately $163 million. BCO is a
leading supplier of silicon-on-insulator wafers used for
fabricating micromechanical optical devices for optical
switching and communications applications. In connection with
this acquisition, we recorded approximately $158 million of
goodwill. There was no in-process research and development
write-off related to this acquisition. During the second quarter
of fiscal 1999, we acquired two DSP tools companies, White
Mountain DSP, Inc. of Nashua, New Hampshire (WM) and
Edinburgh Portable Compilers Limited, of Edinburgh, Scotland
(EPC). The total cost of these acquisitions was approximately
$23 million with additional cash consideration of up to a
maximum of $10 million payable if the acquired companies
achieve certain revenue and operational objectives. As of
November 3, 2001 all of the additional cash consideration
has been paid and accounted for as additional purchase price. In
connection with the acquisitions of WM and EPC, we recorded a
charge of $5.1 million for the write-off of in-process
research and development.

Selling, marketing, general and administrative
(SMG&A) expenses were $287 million in fiscal 2001, a
decrease of $6 million from the $293 million in fiscal
2000. As a percentage of sales, SMG&A increased to 12.6% for
fiscal 2001 from 11.4% in fiscal 2000 as a result of reduced
revenue levels. In fiscal 2000, SMG&A expenses increased
$83 million from $210 million in fiscal 1999. As a
percentage of sales, SMG&A decreased to 11.4% in fiscal 2000
from 14.5% in fiscal 1999 as a result of increased sales.

During fiscal 2001, we recorded a special charge
of approximately $47 million related to cost reduction
actions taken in response to the current economic climate. The
actions consisted of workforce reductions in manufacturing,
which included a decision to consolidate worldwide manufacturing
operations and rationalize production planning and quality
activities. Workforce reductions also occurred, to a lesser
extent, in selling, marketing and administrative areas. As of
November 3, 2001, the cost reductions included severance
and fringe benefit costs of approximately $30 million for
approximately 1,200 employees in the U.S., Europe, Asia and the
Philippines, of which approximately half of these employees were
terminated as of November 3, 2001. The special charge also
included approximately $12 million related to the
abandonment of equipment resulting from the consolidation of
worldwide manufacturing operations. We believe that the
workforce reductions will result in annual salary savings of
approximately $40 million with a $27 million reduction
in cost of sales and a $13 million reduction in operating
expenses. The impact in fiscal 2002 of these cost savings is
expected to be approximately $30 million, with a
$20 million reduction in cost of sales and a
$10 million reduction in operating expenses.

Our operating income was $408 million, or
17.9% of sales, for fiscal 2001, compared to $767 million,
or 29.8% of sales, in fiscal 2000 and $243 million, or
16.7% of net sales, for fiscal 1999.

In fiscal 1999, we sold 78% of our investment in
WaferTech, LLC (WaferTech) to other WaferTech partners in
exchange for $105 million in cash, which was equal to 78%
of the carrying value of the equity ownership at
October 31, 1998. During the first quarter of fiscal 2001,
we completed the sale of our remaining investment in WaferTech
to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for approximately
$61 million in cash. We recorded a pretax realized gain on
the sale of this investment of approximately $28 million.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2000, we sold our investment in
Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Pte. Ltd. We received
proceeds of approximately $65 million in cash and realized
a pretax gain of approximately $44 million. These realized
gains are included in other nonoperating income.

Interest expense was $62 million in fiscal
2001 compared to $6 million in fiscal 2000. The increase in
interest expense was the result of a full year of interest
expense on our $1,200 million of 4.75% convertible
subordinated notes, which were issued in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2000. Interest income was $133 million in fiscal
2001 compared to $63 million in fiscal 2000. The increase
in interest income was due to higher cash



balances from increased cash flow as well as the
unused portion of the funds obtained from the issuance of our
4.75% convertible subordinated notes.

Our effective income tax rate remained relatively
flat at 29.7% for fiscal 2001 as compared to 29.9% for fiscal
2000, primarily due to a shift in the mix of worldwide profits
offset by a taxable gain on the sale of our remaining WaferTech
investment. Our effective income tax rate increased to 29.9% for
fiscal 2000 from 23.6% in fiscal 1999 due to increased profits
in higher tax jurisdictions, principally the United States.

Fiscal 2001 net income was $356 million, or
15.7% of sales, and diluted earnings per share was $0.93
compared to net income in fiscal 2000 of $607 million and
diluted earnings per share of $1.59. The fiscal 2001 decrease in
net income from fiscal 2000 was primarily due to reduced revenue
levels. Net income increased to $607 million, or 23.6% of
sales, in fiscal 2000 from $197 million, or 13.6% of sales,
in fiscal 1999.

Effective October 29, 2000, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 133, (FAS 133), “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138,
“Accounting for Certain Instruments and Certain Hedging
Activities.” FAS 133 requires that an entity recognize
all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure such
instruments at fair market value. Under certain circumstances, a
portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially
reported as a component of other comprehensive income
(OCI) until the hedged transaction affects earnings. For a
derivative not designated as a hedging instrument, the gain or
loss is recognized in income immediately. While the adoption of
FAS 133 on October 29, 2000 did not have a material
impact on operations, it resulted in a $5 million loss
recognized in OCI, which was reclassified into earnings during
fiscal 2001.

In August 2001 the Company adopted Securities and
Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin 101,
(SAB 101), “Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements.” SAB 101 summarizes the application of
generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition
in financial statements. The adoption of this standard did not
have a material effect on our financial position or results of
operations.

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 141, (FAS 141), “Business Combinations”
and No. 142, (FAS 142), “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets.” FAS 141 requires that all business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting. Under FAS 142,
which is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to
have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be
subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the
Statement. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized
over their estimated useful lives. We must adopt these new
pronouncements no later than November 2002, with earlier
adoption permitted. Application of the non-amortization
provisions of FAS 142 is expected to result in an increase
in net income of approximately $54 million, beginning in
fiscal 2003. We will apply the new rules on accounting for
goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first
quarter of fiscal 2003 and have not yet determined what effect,
if any, the adoption of FAS 141 and 142 will have on our
financial position or results of operations.

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 143, (FAS 143), “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations,” which addresses financial
accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated
asset retirement costs. It also applies to legal obligations
associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result
from the acquisition, construction, development and
(or) the normal operation of a long-lived asset, except for
certain obligations of lessees. We are required to adopt
FAS 143 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and we do not
believe that the adoption of FAS 143 will have a material
effect on our financial position or results of operations.

In August 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 144, (FAS 144), “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” which
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the
impairment of long-lived assets. This statement supersedes
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121,
“Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of” and the accounting and
reporting provisions for



the disposal of a segment of a business of
APB Opinion No. 30, “Reporting the Results of
Operations-Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a
Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring
Events and Transactions.” We are required to adopt
FAS 144 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and we have not
yet determined what effect, if any, the adoption of FAS 144
will have on our financial position or results of operations.

The impact of inflation on our business during
the past three years has not been significant.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

At November 3, 2001, we had
$2,793 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments compared to $2,235 million at October 28,
2000. The $558 million increase in cash, cash equivalents
and short-term investments was primarily due to operating cash
inflows of $844 million (37% of fiscal 2001 sales) offset
by $297 million of capital spending. In fiscal 2000, our
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased by
$1,473 million primarily due to operating cash inflows of
$705 million, or 27% of sales in fiscal 2000, and
$1,172 million of proceeds from the issuance of long-term
debt offset by $275 million of capital spending and
$169 million of acquisition-related spending. Investing
activities used $1,220 million in fiscal 2001 and
$456 million in fiscal 2000, while financing activities
generated $2 million in fiscal 2001 and $1,130 million
in fiscal 2000.

Accounts receivable of $218 million at the
end of fiscal 2001 decreased $246 million or 53% from
$464 million at the end of fiscal 2000. This decrease
resulted principally from a $382 million decrease in sales
from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 to the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2001. Days sales outstanding improved from 52 days
at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 to 46 days
at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. As a percentage
of annualized fourth quarter sales, accounts receivable was
12.9% at the end of fiscal 2001, down from 14.4% at the end of
fiscal 2000.

Inventories decreased $85 million, or 26%,
from fiscal 2000 to $247 million at the end of fiscal 2001.
Days cost of sales in inventory increased by 21 days to
111 days as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal
2001. The decrease in inventory in absolute dollar terms is
attributable to production decreases in response to reduced
demand for our products as well as an increase in inventory
reserves and a sharp curtailment of spending on wafers supplied
by external foundries. We employ a variety of consistent
methodologies to determine the amount of inventory reserves
necessary. While a portion of the reserve is determined via
reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market
calculations, an element of the reserve is subject to
significant judgments by us about future demand for our
inventory. Although we believe that we have used our best
efforts and information to estimate future demand, due to the
uncertain economic times and the difficulty inherent in
predicting future results, it is possible that actual demand for
our products will differ from our estimates. If actual demand
for products is less than our estimates, additional reserves for
existing inventories may need to be reflected in future periods.

Net additions to property, plant and equipment of
$297 million for fiscal 2001 were funded with a combination
of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. Capital
spending in fiscal 2001 increased slightly from the
$275 million incurred in fiscal 2000. Significant fiscal
2001 capital additions included new facilities in Wilmington,
MA; Sunnyvale, CA; and Limerick, Ireland. We currently plan to
make capital expenditures of approximately $70 million in
fiscal 2002. Depreciation expense is expected to increase to
$171 million in fiscal 2002 from $158 million in
fiscal 2001.

We acquired five companies during fiscal 2001, as
more fully described in “Results of Operations.” Total
cash used to purchase these companies was approximately
$38 million.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, we
issued $1,200 million of 4.75% Convertible Subordinated
Notes due 2005 (2005 Notes), with semiannual interest
payments on April 1 and October 1 of each year,
commencing April 1, 2001. The 2005 Notes are
convertible, at the option of the holder, into our common stock
at any time unless previously redeemed or repurchased, at a
conversion price of $129.78 per share, subject to adjustment in
certain events. The net proceeds of the offering were
$1,172 million after payment of



the underwriting discount and expenses of the
offering, which will be amortized over the term of the
2005 Notes. After the issuance of the 2005 Notes, our
debt-to-equity ratio increased to 53%.

At November 3, 2001, our principal sources
of liquidity were $2,793 million of cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.

We believe that our existing sources of liquidity
and cash expected to be generated from future operations,
together with current and anticipated available long-term
financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital
expenditures and research and development efforts for the
foreseeable future.

Forward-Looking Statements

The “Management Analysis” and other
sections of this report contain forward-looking statements that
are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and
projections about the industry and markets in which we operate,
management’s beliefs and assumptions made by management. In
addition, other written or oral statements that constitute
forward-looking statements may be made by or on our behalf.
Words such as “expect,” “anticipate,”
“intend,” “plan,” “believe,”
“seek,” “estimate,” variations of such words
and similar expressions are intended to identify such
forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees
of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties
and assumptions that are difficult to predict. (See
“Factors That May Affect Future Results” below.)
Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially
from what is expressed or forecast in such forward-looking
statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise.

Factors That May Affect Future
Results

Our future operating results are difficult to
	predict and may materially fluctuate.

Our future operating results are difficult to
predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors,
including the timing of new product announcements or
introductions by us or our competitors, competitive pricing
pressures, fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate
availability of wafers and manufacturing capacity, the risk that
our backlog could decline significantly, our ability to hire,
retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other
qualified employees to meet the demands of our largest
customers, changes in product mix, and the effect of adverse
changes in economic conditions in the United States and
international markets. In addition, the semiconductor market has
historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic
downturns at various times, including the recent decline in
demand experienced during fiscal 2001. Our business is subject
to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance,
depending on the mix of future business, that products stocked
in inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them.
As a result of these and other factors, there can be no
assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in
future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis.

Our future success depends upon our ability to
	develop and market new products and enter new markets.

Our success significantly depends on our
continued ability to develop and market new products. There can
be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce
new products in a timely manner or that new products, if
developed, will achieve market acceptance. In addition, our
growth is dependent on our continued ability to penetrate new
markets where we have limited experience and competition is
intense. There can be no assurance that the markets we serve
will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will
meet the requirements of these markets, that our products will
achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors
will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take
market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain profits
in these markets. Also, some of our customers in these markets
are less well established, which could subject us to increased
credit risk.



We may not be able to compete successfully in
	the semiconductor industry in the future.

The semiconductor industry is intensely
competitive. Some of our competitors have greater technical,
marketing, manufacturing and financial resources than we do. Our
competitors also include emerging companies attempting to sell
products to specialized markets that we serve. Our competitors
have, in some cases, developed and marketed products having
similar design and functionality as our products. There can be
no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the
future against existing or new competitors or that our operating
results will not be adversely affected by increased price
competition.

We may not be able to satisfy increasing
	demand for our products, and increased production may lead to
	overcapacity and lower prices.

The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry
has resulted in sustained or short-term periods when demand for
our products has increased or decreased rapidly. We and the
semiconductor industry experienced a period of rapid decreases
in demand in fiscal 2001. As a result we have overcapacity due
to the expansion of our production facilities and increased
access to third-party foundries. However, we cannot be sure that
we will not encounter unanticipated production problems at
either our own facilities or at third-party foundries, or that
our capacity will be sufficient to satisfy demand for our
products. We believe that other semiconductor manufacturers have
expanded their production capacity over the past several years.
This expansion by us and our competitors and the continuation of
the decline in the demand for semiconductor products that began
in early fiscal 2001, has led to overcapacity in our target
markets, which has resulted in a year over year decline in our
revenue rate and could lead to price erosion that would
adversely affect our operating results.

We rely on third-party subcontractors and
	manufacturers for some industry-standard wafers and
	assembly/test services and therefore cannot control their
	availability or conditions of supply.

We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on
assembly and test subcontractors and on third-party wafer
fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be
manufactured using industry-standard digital processes. This
reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over
delivery schedules, manufacturing yields and costs.

Our revenues may not increase enough to offset
	the expense of additional capacity.

Our capacity additions resulted in a significant
increase in operating expenses. If revenue levels do not
increase enough to offset these additional expense levels, our
future operating results could be adversely affected. In
addition, asset values could be impaired if the additional
capacity is underutilized for an extended period of time.

We rely on manufacturing capacity located in
	geologically unstable areas, which could affect the availability
	of supplies and services.

We, and many companies in the semiconductor
industry, rely on internal manufacturing capacity located in
California and Taiwan as well as wafer fabrication foundries in
Taiwan and other sub-contractors in geologically unstable
locations around the world. This reliance involves risks
associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the
semiconductor industry, including temporary loss of capacity,
availability and cost of key raw materials and equipment, and
availability of key services including transport. In addition,
California has recently experienced intermittent interruption in
the availability of electricity. To date, the impact on us has
been negligible. However, electricity is a critical resource for
us, without which our products could not be manufactured at
factories exposed to continued lengthy power interruptions.

We are exposed to economic, political and
	other risks through our significant worldwide
	operations.

During fiscal 2001, 61% of our revenues were
derived from customers in international markets. We have
manufacturing facilities outside the United States in Ireland,
the United Kingdom, the Philippines and Taiwan. In addition to
being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the
semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic and
political risks inherent in international operations and their
impact on the



U.S. economy in general, including the risks
associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic
instability in many countries around the world as well as the
economic disruption from acts of terrorism, particularly in the
aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001
and the response to them of the United States and its allies.
These risks include air transportation disruptions,
expropriation, currency controls and changes in currency
exchange rates, tax and tariff rates and freight rates, and
social and political unrest. Although we engage in hedging
transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate
fluctuations, there can be no assurance that our competitive
position will not be adversely affected by changes in the
exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against other currencies.

We are involved in frequent litigation
	regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly to
	defend and could require us to redesign products or pay
	significant royalties.

The semiconductor industry is characterized by
frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other
intellectual property rights. We have from time to time
received, and may in the future receive, claims from third
parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their
patents or other intellectual property rights. In the event a
third party makes a valid intellectual property claim and a
license is not available on commercially reasonable terms, we
could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of
products incorporating that intellectual property, and our
operating results could be materially and adversely affected.
Litigation may be necessary to enforce patents or other of our
intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of
infringement, and this litigation can be costly and divert the
attention of key personnel. See Note 10 of the Notes to our
Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended
November 3, 2001 for information concerning pending
litigation that involves us. An adverse outcome in this
litigation could have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results
of operations or cash flows in the period in which the
litigation is resolved.

Leverage and debt service obligations may
	adversely affect our cash flow.

We have a substantial amount of outstanding
indebtedness. We may be unable to generate cash sufficient to
pay the principal of, interest on, and other amounts due in
respect of, this indebtedness when due. Our substantial leverage
could have significant negative consequences. This substantial
leverage could increase our vulnerability to general adverse
economic and industry conditions. It may require the dedication
of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow from
operations to service the indebtedness, thereby reducing the
amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes,
including capital expenditures. It may also limit our
flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our
business and the industry in which we operate.

ITEM 7A.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
	MARKET RISK

We have fixed rate debt obligations and interest
rate swap and cap agreements. An increase in interest rates
would not significantly increase interest expense due to the
fixed nature of our debt obligations. Because of the size and
structure of these obligations, a 100 basis point increase in
interest rates would not result in a material change in our
interest expense or the fair value of the debt obligations and
related interest rate swap and cap agreements for fiscal 2001
and fiscal 2000. The fair value of our investment portfolio
would not be significantly impacted by either a 100 basis
point increase or decrease in interest rates in fiscal 2001 and
fiscal 2000 due mainly to the short-term nature of the major
portion of our investment portfolio. The related interest income
would change by approximately $6 million for each
100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates for
fiscal 2001 on a weighted average portfolio maturity of
93 days. The impact of a 100 basis point increase or
decrease in interest rates on interest income was not material
for fiscal 2000 due mainly to the relative insignificance of
interest income to the consolidated pretax income.

As more fully described in Note 2
(i) in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements,
we regularly hedge our non-U.S. dollar-based exposures by
entering into forward exchange contracts. The terms of these
contracts are for periods matching the duration of the
underlying exposure and generally range from three months up to
one year. The short-term nature of these contracts has resulted
in these instruments having insignificant fair values at
November 3, 2001 and October 28, 2000. Currently, our
largest foreign currency



exposure is against the Euro, primarily because
Europe has a higher proportion of local currency denominated
expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at
November 3, 2001 and October 28, 2000, a 10%
unfavorable movement in foreign exchange rates would not expose
us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows or
significantly diminish the fair value of our foreign currency
financial instruments, primarily due to the short lives of the
affected financial instruments that effectively hedge
substantially all of our year-end exposures against fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates. The calculation assumes that
each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative
to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of
changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the
volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as
competitors’ products become more or less attractive. Our
sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign
currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in
sales levels or local currency selling prices.

Summary of Significant Accounting
	Policies

a.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and all of its wholly owned
subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all significant intercompany
accounts and transactions are eliminated. The Company’s
fiscal year ends on the 52-week or 53-week period ending on the
Saturday closest to the last day in October. Fiscal year 2001
was a 53-week year, and fiscal years 2000 and 1999 were each
52-week years.

Certain amounts reported in previous years have
been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2001 presentation,
such reclassifications were immaterial.

b.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and
	Investments

Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid
investments with insignificant interest rate risk and maturities
of three months or less at the time of acquisition. Investments
with maturities between three and twelve months at time of
acquisition are considered short-term investments. Cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of
commercial paper and government agency discount notes, but also
include certificates of deposit, bank time deposits,
institutional money market funds and bankers’ acceptances.
Long-term investments consist of mutual funds, commercial paper
and bank money market funds that are acquired to generate
returns that offset changes in certain liabilities related to
deferred compensation arrangements, as well as equity securities.

The Company classifies its investments in readily
marketable debt and equity securities as
“held-to-maturity,” “available-for-sale” or
“trading” at the time of purchase and such designation
is evaluated as of each balance sheet date. Held-to-maturity
securities, which are carried at amortized cost, include only
those securities the Company has the positive intent and ability
to hold to maturity. Securities, such as bank time deposits,
which by their nature are typically held to maturity, are
classified as such. The Company’s other readily marketable
investments are classified as either available-for-sale or
trading. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value
with unrealized gains and losses, net of related tax, if any,
reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity.
Realized gains and losses, as well as interest, dividends and
capital gains distributions on all securities, are included in
earnings.

Cash equivalents and short-term investments
classified as available-for-sale were $2,624 million and
$2,167 million at November 3, 2001 and
October 28, 2000, respectively and those classified as
held-to-maturity were $108 million and $7 million at
November 3, 2001 and October 28, 2000, respectively.
All of



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

these securities have contractual maturities of
twelve months or less at time of acquisition. Because of the
short term to maturity, and hence relative price insensitivity
to changes in market interest rates, amortized cost approximates
fair value for all of these securities. As such, no realized or
unrealized gains or losses were recorded during each of these
years. There were no cash equivalents or short-term investments
classified as trading at November 3, 2001 and
October 28, 2000.

Long-term investments classified as trading were
$243 million and $182 million at November 3, 2001
and October 28, 2000, respectively, and were based on
published market quotes on November 2, 2001 and
October 27, 2000. Gross realized and unrealized gains and
losses from trading securities were not material in fiscal 2001,
fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999. There were approximately
$1.7 million and $0 at November 3, 2001 and
October 28, 2000, respectively, of long-term investments
classified as available-for-sale. Gross realized gains on
available-for-sale investments were $0 in fiscal 2001 and
$44 million in fiscal 2000. Gross unrealized gains and
losses were not material in fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000. There
were no long-term investments classified as held-to-maturity at
November 3, 2001 and October 28, 2000.

c.

Supplemental Cash Flow Statement
	Information

The Company’s primary non-cash financing
activities in fiscal 2001 resulted from its current year
acquisitions for which 1,462,066 shares of common stock
were issued (valued at approximately $81.8 million) and the
assumption of stock options with a fair value of approximately
$4.9 million. As a result, the Company recognized
approximately $8.8 million of stock-based compensation
expense. The Company’s non-cash financing activities in
fiscal 1999 consisted solely of the conversion of its 3.50%
Convertible Subordinated Notes into common stock.

d.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost
(first-in, first-out method) or market. Inventories at
November 3, 2001 and October 28, 2000 were as follows:

e.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost
less allowances for depreciation and amortization. The
straight-line method of depreciation is used for all classes of
assets for financial statement purposes; both straight-line and
accelerated methods are used for income tax purposes.
Capitalized leases and leasehold improvements are amortized
based upon the lesser of the term of the lease or the useful
life of the asset. Depreciation and amortization are based on
the following useful lives:

Buildings & Building Equipment

Up to 25 years

Machinery & Equipment

3-10 years

Office Equipment

3-8 years



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Total depreciation and amortization of property,
plant and equipment was $158 million, $143 million and
$139 million in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Property, plant and equipment included $77 million and
$82 million of capitalized leases in fiscal 2001 and 2000,
net of $56 million and $49 million, respectively, of
accumulated depreciation.

Property, plant and equipment includes
capitalized interest of $6.5 million and $0 as of
November 3, 2001 and October 28, 2000, respectively.

f.

Goodwill and Other Acquisition-related
	Intangibles

Other intangibles include items such as acquired
trained workforce and customer base. Goodwill and intangibles
are evaluated for impairment periodically or whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may
not be recoverable based on the related undiscounted cash flows.
Amortization lives are principally five years.

The balances shown are net of total accumulated
amortization of $88 million and $35 million as of
November 3, 2001 and October 28, 2000, respectively.
Amortization of goodwill and other acquisition-related
intangibles was $53 million, $13 million and
$4 million for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

g.

Grant Accounting

The Company’s manufacturing facility in
Limerick, Ireland has received various grants from the
Industrial Development Authority of the Republic of Ireland.
These grants include capital, employment and research and
development grants. Capital grants for the acquisition of
property and equipment are netted against the related capital
expenditures and amortized as a credit to depreciation expense
over the useful life of the related asset. Employment grants,
which relate to employee hiring and training, and research and
development grants are recognized in earnings in the period in
which the related expenditures are incurred by the Company.

h.     Translation
of Foreign Currencies

The functional currency for the Company’s
foreign sales operations is the applicable local currency. Gains
and losses resulting from translation of these foreign
currencies into U.S. dollars are accumulated in other
comprehensive income. Transaction gains and losses are included
in income currently, including those at the Company’s
principal foreign manufacturing operations where the functional
currency is the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains
or losses included in other expenses, net, were not material in
fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999.

i.     Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Agreements

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange
contracts, foreign currency option contracts and currency swap
agreements to offset certain operational and balance sheet
exposures from the impact of changes in foreign currency
exchange rates. Such exposures result from the portion of the
Company’s operations, assets and liabilities that are
denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily
the Japanese yen and the Euro. These foreign exchange contracts
are entered into to support product sales, purchases and
financing transactions made in the normal course of business,
and accordingly, are not speculative in nature.



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Effective October 29, 2000, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 133, (FAS 133), “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138, (FAS
138), “Accounting for Certain Instruments and Certain
Hedging Activities.” As a result of the adoption of FAS
133, the Company recognizes all derivative financial instruments
in the consolidated financial statements at fair value
regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the instrument.
Changes in the fair value of the derivative financial
instruments are either recognized periodically in earnings or in
stockholders’ equity as a component of other comprehensive
income (OCI) depending on whether the derivative financial
instrument qualifies for hedge accounting. Changes in fair
values of derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting are
reported in earnings. While the adoption of FAS 133 on
October 29, 2000 did not have a material impact on
operations, it resulted in a $5 million loss recognized in
OCI, which was reclassified into earnings during fiscal 2001.

Foreign Exchange Exposure Management —
The Company has significant international sales and purchase
transactions in foreign currencies and has a policy of hedging
forecasted and actual foreign currency risk with forward foreign
exchange contracts. The Company’s forward foreign exchange
contracts are denominated in Japanese yen and the Euro and are
for periods consistent with the terms of the underlying
transactions, generally one year or less. Derivative instruments
are employed to eliminate or minimize certain foreign currency
exposures that can be confidently identified and quantified. In
accordance with FAS 133, hedges related to anticipated
transactions are designated and documented at the inception of
the respective hedge as cash flow hedges and evaluated for
effectiveness monthly. As the terms of the forward contract and
the underlying transaction are matched at inception, forward
contract effectiveness is calculated by comparing the fair value
of the contract to the change in the forward value of the
anticipated transaction, with the effective portion of the gain
or loss on the derivative instrument reported as a component of
OCI in stockholders’ equity and reclassified into earnings
in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects
earnings. Any residual change in fair value of the instruments,
or ineffectiveness, is recognized immediately in other expense.
No ineffectiveness was recognized in fiscal 2001.

Additionally, the Company enters into foreign
currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses
generated by the remeasurement of certain recorded assets and
liabilities in a non-functional currency. Changes in the fair
value of these undesignated hedges are recognized in other
expense immediately as an offset to the changes in the fair
value of the asset or liability being hedged.

Derivative financial instruments involve, to a
varying degree, elements of market and credit risk not
recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The market
risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency
exchange rate or interest rate movements is expected to offset
the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and
liabilities being hedged. The counterparties to the agreements
relating to the Company’s foreign exchange and interest
rate instruments consist of a number of major international
financial institutions with high credit ratings. The Company
does not believe that there is significant risk of
nonperformance by these counterparties because the Company
continually monitors the credit ratings of such counterparties,
and limits the financial exposure with any one financial
institution. While the contract or notional amounts of
derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the
volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount
of the Company’s exposure to credit risk. The amounts
potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible
inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their
contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by
which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts
exceed the obligations of the Company to the counterparties.

Accumulated Derivative Gains or
Losses

The following table summarizes activity in other
comprehensive income related to derivatives classified as cash
flow hedges held by the Company during the period of
October 29, 2000 (the date of adoption of FAS 133) through
November 3, 2001:

All of the accumulated gain will be reclassified
into earnings over the next twelve months.

j.

Fair Values of Financial
	Instruments

The following estimated fair value amounts have
been determined by the Company using available market
information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However,
considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to
develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates
presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts
that the Company could realize in a current market exchange.

The following methods and assumptions were used
by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for
financial instruments:

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments

— The
carrying amounts of these items are a reasonable estimate of
their fair value due to the short term to maturity and readily
available market for these types of investments.

Long-term
investments

— The
fair value of long-term investments is based on quoted market
values.

Short-term
borrowings

— The
carrying amounts of these variable-rate borrowings approximate
fair value due to the short period of time to maturity.

Long-term
debt

— The fair
value of long-term debt is based on quoted market values.



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Interest rate swap and cap
agreements

— The
fair value of interest rate swap and cap agreements is obtained
from dealer quotes. These values represent the estimated amount
the Company would receive or pay to terminate the agreements
taking into consideration current interest rates.

Forward foreign currency exchange
contracts

— The
estimated fair value of forward foreign currency exchange
contracts is based on the estimated amount at which they could
be settled based on forward market exchange rates.

Foreign currency option
contracts

— The
fair value of foreign currency option contracts is obtained from
dealer quotes. This value represents the estimated net amount
the Company would receive or pay to terminate the agreement.

k.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting period. Such estimates relate to the useful
lives of fixed assets, allowances for doubtful accounts and
customer returns, inventory reserves, potential reserves
relating to litigation matters, accrued liabilities and other
reserves. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and
such differences may be material to the financial statements.

l.     Concentrations
of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally
of investments and trade accounts receivable.

The Company maintains cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments with high credit quality financial
institutions and monitors the amount of credit exposure to any
one financial institution.

The Company sells its products to distributors
and original equipment manufacturers involved in a variety of
industries including industrial automation, instrumentation,
military/aerospace and, to an increasing degree, communications,
computers and peripherals, and high-performance consumer
electronics. The Company has adopted credit policies and
standards to accommodate growth in these markets. The Company
performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers’
financial condition and although the Company generally does not
require collateral, letters of credit may be required from its
customers in certain circumstances. Reserves are provided for
estimated amounts of accounts receivable that may not be
collected.

m.     Concentration
of Other Risks

The semiconductor industry is characterized by
rapid technological change, competitive pricing pressures and
cyclical market patterns. The Company’s financial results
are affected by a wide variety of factors, including general
economic conditions worldwide, economic conditions specific to
the semiconductor industry, the timely implementation of new
manufacturing technologies, the ability to safeguard patents and
intellectual property in a rapidly evolving market and reliance
on assembly and test subcontractors, third-party wafer
fabricators and independent distributors. In addition, the
semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject
to significant economic downturns at various times. The Company
is exposed to the risk of obsolescence of its inventory
depending on the mix of future business. As a result, the
Company may experience significant period-to-period fluctuations
in future operating results due to the factors mentioned above
or other factors.



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

n.     Revenue
Recognition

Prior to fiscal 2001, the Company recognized
revenue from product sales to end users upon shipment. In fiscal
2001, the Company adopted the provisions of Securities and
Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin 101. Accordingly
revenue from product sales to end-users is now recognized when
title passes, which for shipments to certain foreign countries
is subsequent to product shipment. Title for these shipments
ordinarily passes within a week of shipment. This accounting
change did not materially impact the Company’s results of
operations for fiscal 2001. For all periods presented, revenue
is deferred on sales made through distributors until the
distributors resell the products to the end users.

o.     Comprehensive
Income

Components of comprehensive income include net
income and certain transactions that have generally been
reported in the consolidated statement of stockholders’
equity. Other comprehensive income is comprised of net income,
currency translation adjustments, available-for-sale securities
valuation adjustments, and net gain or loss on derivative
instruments designated as cash flow hedges.

p.     Advertising
Expense

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
Advertising expense was $10.4 million in fiscal 2001,
$16.1 million in fiscal 2000 and $13.0 million in
fiscal 1999.

q.     Income
Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on the differences between financial reporting
and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using
the enacted income tax rates and laws that will be in effect
when the temporary differences are expected to reverse.
Additionally, deferred tax assets and liabilities are separated
into current and noncurrent amounts based on the classification
of the related assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes.

r.     Earnings
Per Share of Common Stock

Basic earnings per share is computed based only
on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period, plus the dilutive effect of future issues of common
stock relating to stock option programs and other potentially
dilutive securities. In calculating diluted earnings per share,
the dilutive effect of stock options is computed using the
average market price for the period. In fiscal 2001, a total of
9,246,720 shares related to convertible debt financing and
7,533,121 shares related to outstanding stock options are
excluded from the earnings per share calculation because the
effect would be anti-dilutive, but these shares could be
dilutive in the future. In fiscal 2000, a total of 2,311,680
shares related



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

to convertible debt financing are excluded from
the earnings per share calculation because the effect would be
anti-dilutive. The following table sets forth the computation of
basic and diluted earnings per share:

s.     Stock-Based
Compensation

The Company grants stock options for a fixed
number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to
the fair value of the shares at the date of grant. The Company
accounts for stock option grants in accordance with APB Opinion
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees” and, accordingly, recognizes no compensation
expense for the stock option grants. The Company has granted
restricted stock for a fixed number of shares to employees for
nominal consideration. Compensation expense related to
restricted stock awards is recorded ratably over the restriction
period.

t.     New
Accounting Standards

Effective October 29, 2000, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 133, (FAS 133), “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138,
“Accounting for Certain Instruments and Certain Hedging
Activities.” FAS 133 requires that an entity recognize all
derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure such
instruments at fair market value. Under certain circumstances, a
portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially
reported as a component of other comprehensive income
(OCI) until the hedged transaction affects earnings. For a
derivative not designated as a hedging instrument, the gain or
loss is recognized in income immediately. While the adoption of
FAS 133 on October 29, 2000 did not have a material impact
on operations, it resulted in a $5 million loss recognized
in OCI, which was reclassified into earnings during fiscal 2001.

In August 2001 the Company adopted Securities and
Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin 101, (SAB 101),
“Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.” SAB 101
summarizes the application of generally accepted accounting
principles to revenue recognition in financial statements. The
adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our
financial position or results of operations.

In June 2001 the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 141, (FAS 141), “Business Combinations” and
No. 142, (FAS 142), “Goodwill and Other



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Intangible Assets.” FAS 141 requires that
all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Under FAS
142, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to
have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be
subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the
Statement. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized
over their estimated useful lives. We must adopt these new
pronouncements no later than November 2002 with earlier adoption
permitted. Application of the non-amortization provisions of FAS
142 is expected to result in an increase in net income of
approximately $54 million, beginning in fiscal 2003. We will
apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other
intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2003
and have not yet determined what effect, if any, the adoption of
FAS 141 and 142 will have on our financial position or results
of operations.

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 143, (FAS 143), “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations,” which addresses financial accounting and
reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of
tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement
costs. It also applies to legal obligations associated with the
retirement of long-lived assets that result from the
acquisition, construction, development and (or) the normal
operation of a long-lived asset, except for certain obligations
of lessees. We are required to adopt FAS 143 in the first
quarter of fiscal 2003 and we do not believe that the adoption
of FAS 143 will have a material effect on our financial position
or results of operations.

In August 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 144, (FAS 144), “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” which
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the
impairment of long-lived assets. This statement supersedes
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121,
“Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of” and the accounting and
reporting provisions for the disposal of a segment of a business
of APB Opinion No. 30, “Reporting the Results of
Operations — Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a
Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and
Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions.” We are
required to adopt FAS 144 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003
and we have not yet determined what effect, if any, the adoption
of FAS 144 will have on our financial position or results of
operations.

u.     Stock
Split

On February 15, 2000, the Company’s
Board of Directors approved a 2-for-1 split of the
Company’s common stock, effected as a 100% stock dividend
on March 15, 2000 by the distribution of one share of
common stock for every share held on the record date of
February 28, 2000. In connection with the stock split the
number of common stock purchase rights that are associated with
each share of common stock was reduced from one to one-half. All
historical per share amounts in this report have been restated
to reflect the split.

3.     Acquisitions

During the first quarter of fiscal 2001, the
Company completed the following acquisitions:



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Pro forma results of operations for Neuroth, SPA,
IMI, ChipLogic and Staccato have not been provided herein as
they were not material to the Company on either an individual or
an aggregate basis. The results of operations of each
acquisition are included in the Company’s consolidated
statement of income from the date of each acquisition.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2000, the
Company acquired BCO Technologies plc (BCO), a company with
operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in a cash-for-stock
transaction valued at approximately $163 million. The
acquisition was accounted for as a purchase, and the excess of
the purchase price over the



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

fair value of the assets acquired was allocated
to workforce in place and goodwill, which are being amortized on
the straight-line basis over five years. In connection with the
acquisition, the Company recorded approximately
$158 million of goodwill. There was no in-process research
and development write-off related to this acquisition.

During the second quarter of fiscal 1999, the
Company acquired two DSP tools companies, White Mountain DSP,
Inc. (WM) of Nashua, New Hampshire, and Edinburgh Portable
Compilers Limited (EPC), of Edinburgh, Scotland. The total cost
of these acquisitions was approximately $21 million in cash
and $2 million in common stock of the Company, with
additional cash consideration of up to a maximum of
$10 million (to be accounted for as additional goodwill)
payable if the acquired companies achieve certain revenue and
operational objectives. All of the contingent consideration has
been paid. These acquisitions were accounted for as purchases,
and the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the
assets acquired was allocated to existing technology, workforce
in place, trade names and goodwill, which are being amortized on
the straight-line basis over periods ranging from six to ten
years. In connection with these acquisitions, the Company
recorded a charge of $5.1 million representing the
write-off of in-process research and development.

Pro forma results of operations for BCO, WM and
EPC have not been provided herein as they were not material to
the Company on either an individual or an aggregate basis. The
results of operations of each acquisition are included in the
Company’s consolidated statement of income from the date of
each acquisition.

4.     Industry and
Geographic Segment Information

The Company operates in two segments: the design,
manufacture and marketing of a broad range of integrated
circuits, which comprises approximately 97% of the
Company’s revenue, and the design, manufacture and
marketing of a range of assembled products, which accounts for
the remaining 3% of the Company’s revenue. Effectively, the
Company operates in one reportable segment.

Geographic
Information

5.     Special
Charge

During fiscal 2001, the Company recorded special
charges of approximately $47 million related to cost reduction
actions taken in response to the current economic climate. The
actions consisted of workforce reductions in manufacturing and,
to a lesser extent, in selling, marketing and administrative
areas as well as a decision to consolidate worldwide
manufacturing operations and rationalize production planning and
quality activities.

Through November 3, 2001, the cost
reductions included severance and fringe benefit costs of
$29.6 million for approximately 1,200 employees in the
U.S., Europe, Asia and the Philippines of which approximately
half of these employees have been terminated as of
November 3, 2001. The special charge also included
$11.6 million related to the abandonment of equipment
resulting from the consolidation of worldwide manufacturing
operations and $5.8 million of other charges primarily
related to equipment and lease cancellation fees.

A summary of the special charge is as follows:

The Company expects to complete the above actions
within the next nine to twelve months.

6.     Investments

Investments at November 3, 2001 and
October 28, 2000 were as follows:

During the first quarter of fiscal 2001, the
Company sold its investment in WaferTech, realizing a pretax
gain on the sale of this investment of approximately
$28 million. This gain is included in other nonoperating
income.

Other investments consist primarily of long-term
investments in mutual funds and bank money market funds, which
are related to the Company’s deferred compensation plan and
are offset by a corresponding noncurrent liability to the plan
participants. These investments are classified as trading.

Investments are stated at fair value, which is

and Contingencies

Litigation

The Company was a defendant in a federal lawsuit
brought in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York by U.S. Philips Corporation (Philips). On
October 2, 2000, Philips filed suit against the Company,
Cirrus Logic, Inc., Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, Linear
Technology Corporation and Standard Microsystems Corporation
alleging patent infringement and seeking injunctive relief,
treble damages for alleged willful infringement and unspecified
damages. Subsequent to fiscal 2001, the Company entered into a
settlement with Philips that was not material.

The Company is a defendant in a federal lawsuit
brought in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California by Linear Technology Corporation (LTC).
On June 26, 1997, LTC filed suit against the Company,
Impala Linear Corporation, Toyoda Automatic Loom Works, Ltd.,
Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. and Unitrode Corporation
alleging patent infringement and seeking injunctive relief and
unspecified damages. The case was originally scheduled for trial
on liability issues beginning on September 7, 1999. The
original district judge recused himself and the case was
reassigned three times before the Court granted several motions
for summary judgment of non-infringement in favor of the
defendants in September 2001. The Court also denied LTC’s
motion for summary judgment of infringement and willful
infringement against the Company. On October 4, 2001, the
Court indicated that it would stay the matter and certify
similar issues as to the Company to allow all parties to take
appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit (“Federal Circuit”). LTC, Maxim and Unitrode
have filed cross appeals with the Federal Circuit and have begun
the briefing process. On November 1, 2001, LTC and the
Company jointly petitioned the Federal Circuit to permit them to
address the issues certified for appeal. The joint petition is
still pending. While the Company can give no assurance that it
will prevail in this litigation, it believes that resolution of
this litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s consolidated financial position, although an
unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s results of operations or cash flow in the
quarter, or annual period in which this matter is resolved.

Patent infringement suits were pending against
the Company’s wholly owned French subsidiary by Sextant
Avionique, S.A. (Sextant) in France claiming that the
Company’s accelerometer infringes certain Sextant patents.
Sextant has obtained a court ruling that the Company infringed
Sextant’s French patents, and therefore, unless the
decision is reversed, the Company will be unable to manufacture
or sell any infringing accelerometers in France. The Company is
currently appealing the French court’s decision and expects
a decision to be rendered by the French court in fiscal 2002.
The Company does not believe that the French

court’s decision will have a material
adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or
consolidated results of operations.

From time to time as a normal incidence of the
nature of the Company’s business, various claims, charges
and litigation are asserted or commenced against the Company
arising from, or related to, contractual matters, patents,
trademarks, personal injury, environmental matters, product
liability, insurance coverage and personnel and employment
disputes. As to such claims and litigation, the Company can give
no assurance that it will prevail. However, the Company does not
believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s consolidated financial position, although
an adverse outcome of any of these matters could have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of
operations or cash flow in the quarter, or annual period in
which one or more of these matters are resolved.

11.     Stockholders’
Equity

Stock
Plans

In fiscal 1998, the stockholders approved the
1998 Stock Option Plan (1998 Plan), which provides for the
issuance of nonstatutory and incentive stock options to purchase
up to 30 million shares of common stock. In March 2000, the
stockholders approved an amendment to the 1998 Plan to increase
the shares reserved for issuance by an additional
34 million shares. Officers, employees, directors,
consultants and advisors of the Company and its subsidiaries are
eligible to be granted options under this plan at a price not
less than 100% (110% in the case of incentive stock options
granted to 10% or greater stockholders) of the fair market value
of the common stock at the time the option is granted. The
Company’s 1988 Stock Option Plan was terminated upon
adoption of the 1998 Stock Option Plan; however, options to
purchase common stock remain outstanding under the plan.

While the Company may grant options to employees,
which become exercisable at different times or within different
periods, the Company has generally granted options to employees
that are exercisable on a cumulative basis in annual
installments of 33 1/3% each on the third, fourth and fifth
anniversaries of the date of grant.

Under the 1994 Director Option Plan, which was
amended in 1998, each non-employee director was granted annually
a non-statutory option to purchase 21,000 shares of common stock
at an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date
of grant. Up to 1999, each newly elected non-employee director
received a grant of an option to purchase 21,000 shares of
Common Stock upon his or her election to the Board (the
“Initial Grant”). The 1994 Director Option Plan was
amended in 1999 whereby the number of shares of Common Stock
underlying the Initial Grant was increased from 21,000 to
60,000. On December 8, 1999, the 1994 Director Option Plan
was terminated (effective March 14, 2000), and the Board of
Directors authorized that from and after March 14, 2000,
all options granted to non-employee directors will be granted
under the Company’s 1998 Plan, under which each
non-employee director is granted annually a non-statutory stock
option to purchase 20,000 shares (formerly 25,000 shares) of
common stock at an exercise price equal to the fair market value
on the date of grant. The options granted to directors under the
1998 Plan, as well as the options previously granted under the
1994 Director Option Plan, are exercisable on a cumulative basis
in annual installments of 33 1/3% each on the first, second
and third anniversaries of the date of grant. The Company also
has options outstanding under the 1992 Director Option Plan that
are exercisable on a cumulative basis in annual installments of
33 1/3% each on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries
of the date of grant.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Information with respect to activity under the
stock option plans is set forth below:

The following table summarizes information about
options outstanding at November 3, 2001:

The Company has an employee stock purchase plan
(ESPP) that allows eligible employees to purchase, through
payroll deductions, shares of the Company’s common stock at
85% of the fair market value at specified dates. Employees
purchased 390,719 shares in fiscal 2001 (1,011,624 and 1,312,800
in fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999, respectively) for
$15.2 million ($16.5 million and $12.9 million in
fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999, respectively). At November 3,
2001, approximately 2,991,000 common shares, net of retirements,
remained available for issuance under the ESPP.

Under the 1991 Restricted Stock Plan, which
expired in December 2000, a maximum of 5,400,000 shares of
common stock were authorized for awards by the Company to key
employees for nominal consideration. Shares awarded from the
plan were restricted as to transfer, usually for a period of
five years and, under certain conditions, were subject to
repurchase by the Company at the original purchase price per
share. There were no additional shares awarded under the
restricted stock plans in either fiscal 2001 or fiscal 2000.
During fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, $2.1 million,
$2.2 million, and $2.8 million, respectively, of
compensation was charged to

expense. At November 3, 2001, there were
1,221,982 shares of common stock, net of forfeitures, reserved
for issuance under the 1991 Restricted Stock Plan.

As of November 3, 2001, a total of
90,134,362 common shares were reserved for issuance under the
Company’s stock plans.

Common Stock Repurchase

In November 2000, the Board of Directors
authorized the Company to repurchase up to 15 million
shares of its common stock. As of November 3, 2001, the
Company had purchased 417,400 shares of its common stock at an
average purchase price of $52.30 per share. The repurchased
shares are held as treasury shares and are being used for the
employee stock purchase plan and other benefit plans.

Stock-Based Compensation

As permitted under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123 (FAS 123),
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” the Company
has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and related Interpretations, in accounting for
stock-based awards to employees. Under APB 25, the Company
generally recognizes no compensation expense with respect to
such awards.

Pro forma information regarding net income and
earnings per share is required by FAS 123 for awards
granted after October 28, 1995 as if the Company had
accounted for its stock-based awards to employees under the fair
value method of FAS 123. The fair value of the
Company’s stock-based awards to employees was estimated
using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes
option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models
require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including
the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company’s
stock-based awards to employees have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and
because changes in the subjective input assumptions can
materially affect the fair value estimate, in management’s
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a
reliable single measure of the fair value of its stock-based
awards to employees. The fair value of the Company’s
stock-based awards to employees was estimated assuming no
expected dividends and the following weighted average
assumptions:

The following is a summary of weighted average
grant date values generated by application of the Black-Scholes
model:

As required under FAS 123, the reported net
income and diluted earnings per share have been presented to
reflect the impact had the Company been required to include the
amortization of the Black-Scholes option

value as expense. For purposes of this
disclosure, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized
to expense over the options’ vesting periods. The
Company’s pro forma information follows:

The effects of applying FAS 123 on pro forma
disclosures are not likely to be representative of the effects
on pro forma disclosures of future years. Because FAS 123
is applicable only to options granted subsequent to
October 28, 1995, the pro forma effect is not fully
reflected for fiscal year 1999.

Preferred Stock

The Company has 471,934 authorized shares of
$1.00 par value Preferred Stock. The Board of Directors is
authorized to fix designations, relative rights, preferences and
limitations on the preferred stock at the time of issuance. An
aggregate of 300,000 shares of preferred stock have been
designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock
for issuance in connection with the Company’s Stockholder
Rights Plan.

Common
Stock Purchase Rights

In March 1998, the Board of Directors adopted a
Stockholder Rights Plan (the Stockholder Rights Plan) that
replaced a plan adopted by the Board in 1988. Pursuant to the
Stockholder Rights Plan, after giving effect to the
Company’s two-for-one stock split effected on
March 15, 2000, each share of the Company’s Common
Stock (Common Stock) currently has an associated one-half of a
right. Under certain circumstances, each whole right would
entitle the registered holder to purchase from the Company one
one-thousandth share of Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $180 in cash, subject to
adjustment.

The rights are not exercisable and cannot be
transferred separately from the Common Stock until ten business
days (or such later date as may be determined by the Board of
Directors) after (i) the public announcement that a person
or group of affiliated or associated persons has acquired (or
obtained rights to acquire) beneficial ownership of 15% or more
of Common Stock or (ii) the commencement of a tender offer
or exchange offer that would result in a person or group
beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding Common Stock.
If and when the rights become exercisable, each holder of a
right shall have the right to receive, upon exercise, that
number of shares of Common Stock (or in certain circumstances,
cash property or other securities of the Company) that equals
the exercise price of the right divided by 50% of the current
market price (as defined in the Stockholder Rights Plan) per
share of Common Stock at the date of the occurrence of such
event. In the event at any time after any person becomes an
acquiring person, (i) the Company is consolidated with, or
merged with and into, another entity and the Company is not the
surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or if the
Company is the surviving entity, but shares of its outstanding
common stock are changed or exchanged for stock or securities or
cash or any other property, or (ii) 50% or more of the
Company’s assets or earning power is sold or transferred,
each holder of a right shall thereafter have the right to
receive upon exercise, that number of shares of common stock of
the acquiring company that equals the exercise price of the
right divided by 50% of the current market price of such common
stock at the date of the occurrence of the event.

The rights have certain anti-takeover effects, in
that they would cause substantial dilution to a person or group
that attempts to acquire a significant interest in the Company
on terms not approved by the Board of Directors. The rights
expire on March 17, 2008 but may be redeemed by the Company
for $.001 per right at any time prior to the tenth day following
a person’s acquisition of 15% or more of the Company’s
Common Stock. So long as the rights are not separately
transferable, each new share of Common Stock issued will have
one-half of a right associated with it.

12.     Retirement
Plans

The Company and its subsidiaries have various
savings and retirement plans covering substantially all
employees. The Company maintains a defined contribution plan for
the benefit of its eligible United States employees. This plan
provides for Company contributions of up to 5% of each
participant’s total eligible compensation. In addition, the
Company contributes an amount equal to each participant’s
contribution, if any, up to a maximum of 2% of each
participant’s total eligible compensation, plus 50% of the
contributions between 2% and 4%. The Company also has various
defined benefit pension and other retirement plans for certain
non U.S. employees that are consistent with local statutes and
practices. The total expense related to all of the
Company’s retirement plans was approximately
$28 million in fiscal 2001, $26 million in fiscal 2000
and $21 million in fiscal year 1999, which primarily
consisted of costs related to the U.S. defined contribution
plan. Also included in total expense is pension expense related
to non-U.S. defined benefit plans of approximately
$3 million for each of the fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999.

Non-U.S.
Plan Disclosures

The Company’s funding policy for its foreign
defined benefit pension plans is consistent with the local
requirements of each country. The plans’ assets consist
primarily of U.S. and non-U.S. equity securities, bonds,
property and cash.

Net annual periodic pension cost of non-U.S.
plans is presented in the following table:

$13.2 million and accumulated benefit obligations of
$9.7 million, versus plan assets of $4.8 million for
three plans whose obligations exceeded their assets.
