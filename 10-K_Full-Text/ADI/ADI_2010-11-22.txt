Industry
    Background

Electronic signals fall into one of two categories: analog or
    digital. Analog signals, also known as linear signals, represent
    real-world phenomena, such as temperature, pressure, sound,
    light, speed and motion. This information can be detected and
    measured using analog sensors, which generate an electronic
    signal of continuously-varying voltages and currents. The
    signals from these sensors are initially processed using analog
    methods, such as amplification, filtering and shaping. They are
    then usually converted to digital form for storage or further
    manipulation. Digital signals represent the “ones” and
    “zeros” of binary arithmetic; the further manipulation
    of the signals after conversion to digital form is called
    “digital signal processing,” or DSP. Digital signals
    are often converted back to analog form for functions such as
    video display, audio output or control. We refer to these
    manipulations and transformations as “real-world signal
    processing.” Providing real-world signal processing
    solutions that achieve the customer’s desired performance
    generally involves working in multiple technology domains:
    analog and digital processing, sensors and transducers and power
    management.

New
    Organizational Structure in 2009: Product and Market
    Organizations

We implemented a new organizational structure at the end of 2009
    with the intention of optimizing our focus on the technologies
    we create and the markets we serve. We continue to operate with
    one reporting segment, but under the new organizational
    structure we have two separate groups, one focused on products
    and one focused on end markets. The product group is focused on
    core technology development and leadership in converters,
    amplifiers and radio frequency, or RF, micro-electromechanical
    sensors, or MEMS, power management, and DSP. The end
    market-focused organization is dedicated to understanding,
    selecting, and resourcing initiatives that are more customized
    to a particular market or application. The focus of this team is
    to apply the full expanse of our broad technology portfolio to
    more integrated and targeted product strategies for the
    industrial, healthcare, automotive, consumer, and communications
    infrastructure markets. The end market group includes our sales
    organization.

These two new groups collaborate at all levels. On the one hand,
    our product group develops key technology for use by the end
    market groups, which apply these technologies to specific
    applications. Equally important, the applications expertise
    within each end market group is used to enhance core technology
    development by our product group.

Principal
    Products

We design, manufacture and market a broad line of
    high-performance ICs that incorporate analog, mixed-signal and
    digital signal processing technologies. Our ICs are designed to
    address a wide range of real-world signal processing
    applications. Our product portfolio includes both
    general-purpose products used by a broad range of customers and
    applications, as well as application-specific products designed
    for specific clusters of customers in key target markets. By
    using readily available, high-performance, general-purpose
    products in their systems, our customers can reduce the time
    they need to bring new products to market. Given the high cost
    of developing more customized ICs, our standard products often
    provide a cost-effective solution for many low to medium volume
    applications. However, for some industrial, medical, automotive,
    consumer, and communications products, we focus on working with
    leading customers to design application-specific solutions. We
    begin with our existing core technologies in data conversion,
    amplification, RF, MEMS, power management and DSP, and devise a
    solution to more closely meet the needs of a specific customer
    or group of customers. Because we have already developed the
    core technology for our general-purpose products, we can create
    application-specific solutions quickly.



We produce and market several thousand products and operate in
    one reporting segment. Our ten highest revenue products, in the
    aggregate, accounted for approximately 9% of our revenue for
    fiscal 2010. A breakdown of our fiscal 2010 revenue by product
    category follows.

Analog
    Products

Our analog IC technology has been the foundation of our business
    for over four decades, and we are one of the world’s
    largest suppliers of high-performance analog ICs. Our analog
    signal processing ICs are primarily high-performance devices,
    generally defined today as devices that support a minimum of
    12-bits of accuracy and a minimum of 50 megahertz of speed. The
    principal advantages these products have versus
    competitors’ products include higher accuracy, lower cost
    per function, smaller size, lower power consumption and fewer
    components, resulting in improved reliability. Our product
    portfolio includes several thousand analog ICs, any one of which
    can have as many as several hundred customers. Our analog ICs
    typically have long product life cycles. Our analog
    IC customers include both original equipment manufacturers,
    or OEMs, and customers who build electronic subsystems for
    integration into larger systems.

We derive the majority of our analog signal processing IC
    product revenue from sales of data converters and amplifiers. We
    are the industry’s leading supplier of data converter
    products. Data converters translate real-world analog signals
    into digital data and also translate digital data into analog
    signals. Data converters remain our largest and most diverse
    product family and an area where we are continuously innovating
    to enable our customers to redefine and differentiate their
    products. With the industry’s leading portfolio of ADCs

(analog-to-digital

converters) and DACs

(digital-to-analog

converters), our converter products combine sampling rates and
    accuracy with the low noise, power, price and small package size
    required by industrial, medical, automotive, consumer, and
    communications electronics. We are also a leading supplier of
    high-performance amplifiers. Amplifiers are used to condition
    analog signals and minimize noise. We provide high speed,
    precision, RF, broadband, instrumentation and other amplifiers.
    We also offer an extensive portfolio of comparators that are
    used in a wide variety of applications.

Our analog product line also includes a broad portfolio of RF
    ICs covering the entire RF signal chain from industry-leading
    high performance RF function blocks to highly integrated
    broadband and short-range single chip transceiver solutions. To
    date, we have sold our RF ICs principally for cellular
    infrastructure and

point-to-point

applications and have been focused on the high performance end
    of the market.

Also within our analog technology portfolio are products that
    use an advanced IC technology known in the industry as surface
    micromachining, which is used to produce semiconductor products
    known as micro-electromechanical systems, or MEMS. This
    technology enables us to build extremely small mechanical
    sensing elements on the surface of a chip along with supporting
    circuitry. In addition to incorporating an electromechanical
    structure, these devices also have analog circuitry for
    conditioning signals obtained from the sensing element. The
    integration of signal conditioning and MEMS is a unique feature
    of our products which we call
    iMEMS

®

.

    Our iMEMS product portfolio includes accelerometers used to
    sense acceleration, gyroscopes used to sense rotation, and MEMS
    microphones used to capture audio sounds. The majority of our
    current revenue from MEMS products is derived from automotive
    manufacturers, industrial customers, and consumer customers.

Power management and reference products make up the balance of
    our analog sales. Whether the product is plugged into the wall
    or runs on batteries, every electronic device requires some form
    of power management, which can include converters, battery
    chargers, charge pumps, and regulators. We leverage our leading
    analog signal



technology to devise innovative high-performance power
    management ICs, high-reliability infrastructure equipment and
    battery-operated portable medical, communications and consumer
    devices.

Digital
    Signal Processing Products

Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) complete our product portfolio.
    DSPs are optimized for high-speed numeric calculations, which
    are essential for instantaneous, or real-time, processing of
    digital data generated, in most cases, from analog to digital
    signal conversion. Our DSP products are designed to be fully
    programmable and to efficiently execute specialized software
    programs, or algorithms, associated with processing digitized
    real-time, real-world data. Programmable DSPs provide the
    flexibility to modify the device’s function quickly and
    inexpensively using software. Our general-purpose DSP IC
    customers typically write their own algorithms using software
    development tools that we provide and software development tools
    they obtain from third-party suppliers. Our DSPs are designed in
    families of products that share a common architecture and
    therefore can execute the same software. We support these
    products with easy-to-use development tools, which are designed
    to reduce our customers’ product development costs and

time-to-market.

Markets
    and Applications

The following describes some of the characteristics of, and
    customer products within, our major end markets:

Industrial

— Our industrial market
    includes the following sectors:

    Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for further information about our products by category and end
    market.

Research
    and Development

Our markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and
    advances. Accordingly, we make substantial investments in the
    design and development of new products and manufacturing
    processes, and the improvement of existing products and
    manufacturing processes. We spent approximately
    $492 million during fiscal 2010 on the design, development
    and improvement of new and existing products and manufacturing
    processes, compared to approximately $447 million during
    fiscal 2009 and approximately $533 million during fiscal
    2008.



Our research and development strategy focuses on building
    technical leadership in core technologies of converters,
    amplifiers and RF, MEMS, power management, and DSP. In support
    of our research and development activities, we employ thousands
    of engineers involved in product and manufacturing process
    development at 33 design centers and manufacturing sites located
    throughout the world.

Patents
    and Other Intellectual Property Rights

We seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our
    technology and products through the use of patents, copyrights,
    mask works, trademarks and trade secrets. We have a program to
    file applications for and obtain patents, copyrights, mask works
    and trademarks in the United States and in selected foreign
    countries where we believe filing for such protection is
    appropriate. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and
    confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through
    the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements. We have
    obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the
    United States and in other countries. As of October 30,
    2010, we held approximately 1,600 U.S. patents and
    approximately 560 non-provisional pending U.S. patent
    applications. There can be no assurance, however, that the
    rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing
    products in every jurisdiction. While our patents, copyrights,
    mask works, trademarks and trade secrets provide some advantage
    and protection, we believe our competitive position and future
    success is largely determined by such factors as the system and
    application knowledge, innovative skills, technological
    expertise and management ability and experience of our
    personnel; the range and success of new products being developed
    by us; our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing
    efforts; and customer service and technical support. It is
    generally our policy to seek patent protection for significant
    inventions that may be patented, though we may elect, in certain
    cases, not to seek patent protection even for significant
    inventions, if we determine other protection, such as
    maintaining the invention as a trade secret, to be more
    advantageous. We also have trademarks that are used in the
    conduct of our business to distinguish genuine Analog Devices
    products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs to
    promote our brands and identify products containing genuine
    Analog Devices components.

Sales
    Channels

We sell our products globally through a direct sales force,
    third-party distributors, independent sales representatives and
    via our website.

We derived approximately 56% of our fiscal 2010 revenue from
    sales made through distributors. These distributors typically
    maintain an inventory of our products. Some of them also sell
    products which compete with our products, including those for
    which we are an alternate source. In all regions of the world,
    we defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to
    distributors until the distributors resell the products to their
    customers. We make sales to distributors under agreements that
    allow distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to
    return qualifying products for credit, as determined by us, in
    order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or
    obsolete product from their inventory. These agreements limit
    such returns to a certain percentage of our shipments to that
    distributor during the prior quarter. In addition, distributors
    are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the
    relationship with the distributor. Additional information
    relating to our sales to distributors is set forth in
    Note 2n. in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

The categorization of sales into geographic regions set forth
    below is based upon the location of the customer.

about our industry, segment and geographic areas, see our
    Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 4 in the related
    Notes contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

We support our worldwide technical direct field sales efforts by
    an extensive promotional program that includes editorial
    coverage and paid advertising in trade publications, direct mail
    programs, promotional brochures, technical seminars and
    participation in trade shows. We publish and distribute product
    catalogs, applications guides, technical handbooks and detailed
    data sheets for individual products. We also provide this
    information and sell products via our website. We maintain a
    staff of field application engineers who aid customers in
    incorporating our products into their products.

We have tens of thousands of customers worldwide. Our largest
    single customer, excluding distributors, represented
    approximately 4% of our fiscal 2010 revenue. Our 20 largest
    customers, excluding distributors, accounted for approximately
    32% of our fiscal 2010 revenue. These customers used hundreds of
    different types of our products in a wide range of applications
    spanning the industrial, automotive, communication, consumer and
    computer markets.

Seasonality

Sales to customers during our first fiscal quarter may be lower
    than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our
    customers during the holiday season. In general, the seasonality
    for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on
    our results of operations. In addition, as explained in our risk
    factors included elsewhere in this report, our revenue is more
    likely to be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by
    cyclicality in the semiconductor industry.

Through subsidiaries and affiliates, we conduct business in
    numerous countries outside the United States. During fiscal
    2010, we derived approximately 81% of our revenue from customers
    in international markets. Our international business is subject
    to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations,
    including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and
    controls, import and export controls, and other laws, policies
    and regulations of foreign governments. Although we engage in
    hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange
    rate fluctuations, our competitive position may be adversely
    affected by changes in the exchange rate of the
    United States dollar against other currencies.

Production
    and Raw Materials

Monolithic integrated circuit components are manufactured in a
    sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer
    fabrication, wafer testing, cutting the wafer into individual
    “chips,” or dice, assembly of the dice into packages
    and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form.
    The raw materials used to manufacture these devices include
    silicon wafers, processing chemicals (including liquefied
    gases), precious metals and ceramic and plastic used for
    packaging.

We develop and employ a wide variety of proprietary
    manufacturing processes that are specifically tailored for use
    in fabricating high-performance analog, DSP, mixed-signal and
    MEMS ICs. We also use bipolar and complementary metal-oxide
    semiconductor, or CMOS, wafer fabrication processes.

Our IC products are fabricated both at our production facilities
    and by third-party wafer fabricators. Our products are
    manufactured in our own wafer fabrication facilities using
    proprietary processes and at third-party wafer-fabrication
    foundries using

sub-micron

digital CMOS processes. A significant portion of our revenue in
    fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was from products fabricated at
    third-party wafer-fabrication facilities, primarily Taiwan
    Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC. We operate wafer
    fabrication facilities in Wilmington, Massachusetts and
    Limerick, Ireland. We closed our wafer fabrication facility in
    Cambridge, Massachusetts at the end of fiscal 2009. We also
    operate test facilities located in the Philippines and use
    third-party subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our
    products.

Capital spending was $111.6 million in fiscal 2010,
    compared with $56.1 million in fiscal 2009. We currently
    plan to make capital expenditures in the range of approximately
    $120 million to $130 million in fiscal 2011.



Our products require a wide variety of components, raw materials
    and external foundry services, most of which we purchase from
    third-party suppliers. We have multiple sources for many of the
    components and materials that we purchase and incorporate into
    our products. However, a large portion of our external wafer
    purchases and foundry services are from a limited number of
    suppliers, primarily TSMC. If TSMC or any of our other key
    suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver
    sufficient quantities of components to us, on the time schedule
    and of the quality that we require, we may be forced to seek to
    engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result
    in significant expenses and disruptions or delays in
    manufacturing, product development and shipment of product to
    our customers. Although we have experienced shortages of
    components, materials and external foundry services from time to
    time, these items have generally been available to us as needed.

Backlog

Backlog at the end of fiscal 2010 was approximately
    $563 million, up from approximately $411 million at
    the end of fiscal 2009. We define backlog as of a particular
    date to mean firm orders from a customer or distributor with a
    requested delivery date within thirteen weeks. Backlog is
    impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead
    times available from suppliers, including us, in periods of
    depressed demand. In periods of increased demand, there is a
    tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of
    increasing backlog and, in some instances, we may not have
    manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders. As is
    customary in the semiconductor industry, we allow most orders to
    be cancelled or deliveries to be delayed by customers without
    significant penalty. Accordingly, we believe that our backlog at
    any time should not be used as an indication of our future
    revenue.

We typically do not have long-term sales contracts with our
    customers. In some of our markets where end-user demand may be
    particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers
    place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it
    available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to
    make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the
    product. In other instances, we manufacture product based on
    forecasts of customer demand. As a result, we may incur
    inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated
    sales and are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders
    leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. Further,
    those orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the
    customer’s unique requirements so that those cancelled
    orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable
    products, resulting in potential inventory write-offs. As a
    result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for some of our products
    that are subject to these uncertainties, the amount of
    unsaleable product could be substantial.

Government
    Contracts

We estimate that approximately 4% of our fiscal 2010 revenue was
    attributable to sales to the U.S. government and
    U.S. government contractors and subcontractors. Our
    government contract business is predominantly in the form of
    negotiated, firm fixed-price subcontracts. All such contracts
    and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to
    termination at the election of the U.S. government.

Acquisitions,
    Divestitures and Investments

An element of our business strategy involves expansion through
    the acquisition of businesses, assets, products or technologies
    that allow us to complement our existing product offerings,
    expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce
    or enhance our technological capabilities. From time to time, we
    consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen our
    business.

Additional information relating to our acquisition and
    divestiture activities during fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and
    fiscal 2008 is set forth in Note 2u. and Note 6 of the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
    Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.



Competition

We compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets
    that are highly competitive. Our competitors include:

• Broadcom Corporation

• Microchip Technology, Inc.

• Cirrus Logic, Inc.

• National Semiconductor Corporation

• Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.

• NXP Semiconductors

• Infineon Technologies

• ST Microelectronics

• Intersil Corporation

• Silicon Laboratories, Inc.

• Linear Technology Corporation

• Texas Instruments, Inc.

• Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.

We believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for
    real-world signal processing components depends upon several
    factors, including design and quality of products, product
    performance, features and functionality, and product pricing,
    availability and capacity, with the relative importance of these
    factors varying among products, markets and customers. We
    believe our technical innovation emphasizing product performance
    and reliability, supported by our commitment to strong customer
    service and technical support, enables us to compete in our
    chosen markets against both foreign and domestic semiconductor
    manufacturers.

Many other companies offer products that compete with our
    products, and some have greater financial, manufacturing,
    technical and marketing resources than we have. Some of our
    competitors may have better established supply or development
    relationships with our current and potential customers.
    Additionally, some formerly independent competitors have been
    purchased by larger companies. Our competitors also include
    emerging companies selling specialized products into markets we
    serve. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete
    successfully in the future against existing or new competitors,
    or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by
    increased price competition.

Environment,
    Health and Safety

We are committed to protecting the environment and the health
    and safety of our employees, customers and the public. We
    endeavor to adhere to applicable environmental, health and
    safety (EHS) regulatory and industry standards across all of our
    facilities, and to encourage pollution prevention, reduce our
    water and energy consumption, reduce waste generation, and
    strive towards continual improvement. We strive to achieve
    excellence in EHS management practices as an integral part of
    our total quality management system.

Our management systems are certified to ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001,
    ISO 9001 and TS16949. We are an applicant member of the
    Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition, or EICC. In fiscal
    2009, we published our first Sustainability Report, which stated
    our commitment to consuming less energy and applying fair labor
    standards, among other things. We are not including the
    information contained in our Sustainability Report in, or
    incorporating it by reference into this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous and
    increasingly strict federal, state local and foreign EHS laws
    and regulations, particularly with respect to the
    transportation, storage, handling, use, emission, discharge and
    disposal of certain chemicals used or produced in the
    semiconductor manufacturing process. Our products are subject to
    increasingly stringent regulations regarding chemical content in
    jurisdictions where we sell products, including the Restriction
    of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and Registration, Evaluation,
    Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) directives in
    the European Union. Contracts with many of our customers reflect
    these and additional EHS compliance standards. Compliance with
    these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our
    capital expenditures, earnings, financial condition or
    competitive position. There can be no assurance, however, that
    current or future environmental laws and regulations will not
    impose costly



requirements upon us. Any failure by us to comply with
    applicable environmental laws, regulations and contractual
    obligations could result in fines, suspension of production, the
    need to alter fabrication processes and legal liability.

Employees

As of October 30, 2010, we employed approximately 8,500
    individuals worldwide. Our future success depends in large part
    on the continued service of our key technical and senior
    management personnel, and on our ability to continue to attract,
    retain and motivate qualified employees, particularly those
    highly-skilled design, process, test and applications engineers
    involved in the design, support and manufacture of new and
    existing products and processes. We believe that relations with
    our employees are good; however, the competition for such
    personnel is intense, and the loss of key personnel could have a
    material adverse impact on our results of operations and
    financial condition.



ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other
    documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and
    uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ
    materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking
    statements contained in this report.

Disruptions
    in global credit and financial markets could materially and
    adversely affect our business and results of
    operations.

Global credit and financial markets appear to be recovering from
    extreme disruptions experienced over the past two years.
    However, uncertainty about continuing economic stability
    remains. Our business was significantly affected by the global
    economic crisis. These economic uncertainties affect businesses
    such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to
    accurately forecast and plan our future business activities.
    High unemployment rates, continued weakness in commercial and
    residential real estate markets and the tightening of credit by
    financial institutions may lead consumers and businesses to
    continue to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to
    cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders with
    us. In addition, the inability of customers to obtain credit
    could impair their ability to make timely payments to us.
    Customer insolvencies could also negatively impact our revenues
    and our ability to collect receivables. In addition, financial
    difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could
    result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults
    and inventory challenges. Financial turmoil may cause financial
    institutions to consolidate or go out of business, which
    increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the
    future on our financial instruments could differ significantly
    from the fair value assigned to them. During the global
    financial crisis, many governments adopted stimulus or spending
    programs designed to ease the economic impact of the crisis.
    Some of our businesses benefited from these stimulus programs
    and as these programs conclude, those businesses could be
    negatively impacted. The recent debt crisis in certain European
    countries could cause the value of the Euro to deteriorate, thus
    reducing the purchasing power of our European customers. In
    addition, the recent European debt crisis and related financial
    restructuring efforts has contributed to the instability in
    global credit markets. We are unable to predict the impact of
    these events on the apparent economic recovery, and if economic
    conditions deteriorate again, we may record additional charges
    relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and
    our business and results of operations could be materially and
    adversely affected.

Our
    future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income
    are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate.

Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net
    income are difficult to predict and may be materially affected
    by a number of factors, including:

•

the effects of adverse economic conditions in the United States
    and international markets;

•

changes in customer demand for our products and for end products
    that incorporate our products;

•

the effectiveness of our efforts to refocus our operations,
    including our ability to reduce our cost structure in both the
    short term and over a longer duration;

•

the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us,
    our customers or our competitors;

•

competitive pricing pressures;

•

fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of
    wafers and other raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and
    test capacity;

•

the ability of our third party suppliers, subcontractors and
    manufactures to supply us with sufficient quantities of products
    or components;

•

any significant decline in our backlog;

•

the timing, delay or cancellation of significant customer orders
    and our ability to manage inventory;



•

our ability to hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of
    engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of
    our customers;

•

changes in geographic, product or customer mix;

•

our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient
    levels;

•

potential significant litigation-related costs;

•

the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating
    expense levels, including with respect to costs associated with
    labor, utilities, transportation and raw materials;

•

the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide
    environmental regulations;

•

changes in our effective tax rates in the United States, Ireland
    or worldwide; and

•

the effects of public health emergencies, natural disasters,
    widespread travel disruptions, security risks, terrorist
    activities, international conflicts and other events beyond our
    control.

In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been
    cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and
    downturns. Our business is subject to rapid technological
    changes and there can be no assurance, depending on the mix of
    future business, that products stocked in our inventory will not
    be rendered obsolete before we ship them. As a result of these
    and other factors, there can be no assurance that we will not
    experience material fluctuations in future revenue, gross
    margins, operating results and net income on a quarterly or
    annual basis. In addition, if our revenue, gross margins,
    operating results and net income do not meet the expectations of
    securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common
    stock may decline.

Changes
    in our effective tax rate may impact our results of
    operations.

A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate,
    including: increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions; the
    jurisdictions in which profits are earned and taxed; the
    resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax
    authorities; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets
    and liabilities; adjustments to income taxes upon finalization
    of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for
    tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process
    research and development and impairments of goodwill in
    connection with acquisitions; changes in available tax credits;
    and changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws.
    Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could
    adversely impact our net income for future periods.

Long-term
    contracts are not typical for us and reductions, cancellations
    or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our
    operating results.

We typically do not have long-term sales contracts with our
    customers. In certain markets where end-user demand may be
    particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers
    place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it
    available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to
    make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the
    product. In other instances, we manufacture product based on
    forecasts of customer demands. As a result, we may incur
    inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated
    sales and are subject to the risk of cancellations of orders,
    leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. Further,
    orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the
    customer’s unique requirements so that those cancelled or
    unrealized orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of
    unsaleable products, causing potential inventory write-offs. As
    a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the
    products that are subject to these uncertainties, the amount of
    unsaleable product could be substantial. Incorrect forecasts, or
    reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products
    could adversely affect our operating results.

Our
    future success depends upon our ability to continue to innovate,
    improve our products, develop and market new products, and
    identify and enter new markets.

Our success significantly depends on our continued ability to
    improve our products and develop and market innovative new
    products. Product development, innovation and enhancement is
    often a complex, time-consuming and costly process involving
    significant investment in research and development, with no
    assurance of return on



investment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
    develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or
    efficient manner or that new and improved products, if
    developed, will achieve market acceptance. Our products
    generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes
    competing industry standards, which may adversely affect our
    ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur
    significant costs. In addition, our customers generally impose
    very high quality and reliability standards on our products,
    which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy.
    Any inability to satisfy customer quality standards or comply
    with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely
    affect demand for our products and our results of operations. In
    addition, our growth is dependent on our continued ability to
    identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited
    experience and competition is intense. Also, some of our
    customers in these markets are less established, which could
    subject us to increased credit risk. There can be no assurance
    that the markets we serve will grow in the future, that our
    existing and new products will meet the requirements of these
    markets, that our products will achieve customer acceptance in
    these markets, that competitors will not force price reductions
    or take market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain
    adequate gross margins or profits in these markets. Furthermore,
    a decline in demand in one or several of our end-user markets
    could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our
    products and our results of operations.

We may
    not be able to compete successfully in markets within the
    semiconductor industry in the future.

We face intense technological and pricing competition in the
    semiconductor industry, and we expect this competition to
    increase in the future, including from companies located outside
    the United States. Many other companies offer products that
    compete with our products. Some have greater financial,
    manufacturing, technical, sales and marketing resources than we
    have. Some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply
    or development relationships with our current and potential
    customers or suppliers. Our competitors also include emerging
    companies selling specialized products in markets we serve.
    Competition is generally based on design and quality of
    products, product performance, features and functionality, and
    product pricing, availability and capacity, with the relative
    importance of these factors varying among products, markets and
    customers. Existing or new competitors may develop products or
    technologies that more effectively address the demands of our
    customers and markets with enhanced performance, features and
    functionality, lower power requirements, greater levels of
    integration or lower cost. Increased competition in certain
    markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining
    average selling prices, reduced gross margins and loss of market
    share in those markets. There can be no assurance that we will
    be able to compete successfully in the future against existing
    or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be
    adversely affected by increased competition.

We rely
    on third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers for
    some industry-standard wafers, manufacturing processes and
    assembly and test services, and generally cannot control their
    availability or conditions of supply.

We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on suppliers, assembly
    and test subcontractors, and third-party wafer fabricators to
    supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using
    industry-standard submicron processes. This reliance involves
    several risks, including reduced control over availability,
    capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields,
    and costs. Additionally, we utilize a limited number of
    third-party wafer fabricators, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor
    Manufacturing Company, or TSMC. In addition, these suppliers
    often provide manufacturing services to our competitors and
    therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in
    capacity constraints. In certain instances, the third party
    supplier is the sole source of highly specialized processing
    services. If our suppliers are unable or unwilling to
    manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule
    and of the quality or quantity that we require or provide us
    with required manufacturing processes, we may be forced to seek
    to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could
    result in additional expenses and delays in product development
    or shipment of product to our customers. If replacement
    suppliers or manufacturing processes are not available, we may
    also experience delays in product development or shipment which
    could, in turn, result in the temporary or permanent loss of
    customers. A significant portion of our fiscal 2010 revenue was
    from products fabricated at third-party wafer-fabrication
    facilities, primarily TSMC.



The
    markets for semiconductor products are cyclical, and increased
    production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices, and
    conversely, we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for
    our products.

The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted
    in periods when demand for our products has increased or
    decreased rapidly. If we expand our operations and workforce too
    rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of
    increased demand for our products, and that demand does not
    materialize at the pace at which we expect or declines, or if we
    overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand, our
    operating results may be adversely affected as a result of
    increased operating expenses, reduced margins, underutilization
    of capacity or asset impairment charges. These capacity
    expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could
    also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead
    to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating
    results. Conversely, during periods of rapid increases in
    demand, our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy
    the demand. In addition, we may not be able to expand our
    workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner,
    procure adequate resources, or locate suitable third-party
    suppliers, to respond effectively to changes in demand for our
    existing products or to the demand for new products requested by
    our customers, and our current or future business could be
    materially and adversely affected.

Our
    semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to
    product warranty and indemnity claims, which could result in
    significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely
    affect the market acceptance of our products.

Semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain
    defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are
    developed. We generally warrant our products to our customers
    for one year from the date title passes from us. We invest
    significant resources in the testing of our products; however,
    if any of our products contain defects, we may be required to
    incur additional development and remediation costs, pursuant to
    warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer
    contracts and purchase orders. These problems may divert our
    technical and other resources from other product development
    efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers
    or others, including liability for costs associated with product
    recalls, which may adversely impact our operating results. We
    may also be subject to customer indemnity claims. Our customers
    have on occasion been sued, and may in the future be sued, by
    third parties with respect to infringement or other product
    matters, and those customers may seek indemnification from us
    under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them.
    In certain cases, our potential indemnification liability may be
    significant. If any of our products contains defects, or has
    reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation
    may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to
    sell our products to existing and prospective customers and
    could adversely affect our operating results.

We have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial
    amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits
    is a highly complex and precise process. Minute impurities,
    contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in
    the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer
    manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer
    breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of
    wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be
    nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in
    semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes
    could become unstable. This instability could result in
    manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a
    material adverse effect on our operating results.

We are
    involved in frequent litigation, including regarding
    intellectual property rights, which could be costly to bring or
    defend and could require us to redesign products or pay
    significant royalties.

The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims
    and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property
    rights, including claims arising under our contractual
    obligations to indemnify our customers. Other companies or
    individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of
    semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to
    obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from
    making and selling infringing products, if those patents are
    found to be valid. From time to time, we receive claims from
    third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe
    their patents or other intellectual property rights. In the
    event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim
    against us and a license is not available to us on commercially
    reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to
    redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that
    intellectual property, and our operating results could be
    materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be



necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual
    property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement,
    and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of
    our key personnel. We could be subject to warranty or product
    liability claims that could lead to significant costs and
    expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards. There
    can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect
    against all claims and potential liabilities. We may incur costs
    and expenses relating to a recall of our customers’
    products due to an alleged failure of components we supply. An
    adverse outcome in litigation could have a material adverse
    effect on our financial position or on our operating results or
    cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved.

We may be
    unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which may
    limit our ability to compete effectively.

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our
    intellectual property. We primarily rely on patent, mask work,
    copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as
    nondisclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our
    proprietary technologies and processes. Despite our efforts to
    protect our proprietary technologies and processes, it is
    possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties
    may obtain, copy, use or disclose our technologies, products and
    processes. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we
    design, manufacture, market and sell our products may afford
    little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology.

There can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued
    patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In
    addition, any of our existing or future patents may be
    challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As such, any rights
    granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful
    protection. We may not have foreign patents or pending
    applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and
    applications. Even if foreign patents are granted, effective
    enforcement in foreign countries may not be available. If our
    patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology,
    our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours.
    Our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology
    independently or design around our patents.

We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our
    employees, consultants and strategic partners. We also try to
    control access to and distribution of our technologies,
    documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these
    efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy,
    disclose, obtain or use our products or technology without our
    authorization. Also, former employees may seek employment with
    our business partners, customers or competitors, and there can
    be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary
    information will be maintained in the course of such future
    employment.

If we do
    not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our
    business strategy will be adversely affected.

Our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the
    recruitment, retention and effective succession of our executive
    officers and key management and technical personnel,
    particularly our experienced engineers. The competition for
    these employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or
    more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect
    on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material
    adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for
    engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if
    we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do
    not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our
    officers or employees.

To remain
    competitive, we may need to acquire other companies, purchase or
    license technology from third parties, or enter into other
    strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or
    enhance our existing products.

An element of our business strategy involves expansion through
    the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies
    that allow us to complement our existing product offerings,
    expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce
    or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to
    find businesses that have the technology or resources we need
    and, if we find such businesses, we may not be able to purchase
    or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable
    terms or at all. Acquisitions and technology licenses are
    difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons,
    including the cost of potential transactions, competition among
    prospective buyers and licensees, the need for regulatory
    approvals, and difficulties related to integration efforts. Both
    in the U.S. and abroad, governmental regulation of
    acquisitions has become more complex, increasing the costs and
    risks of undertaking significant acquisitions. In order to
    finance a potential transaction, we may need to



raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money.
    We may not be able to find financing on favorable terms, and the
    sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing
    shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are
    superior to the rights of our common shareholders.

Acquisitions also involve a number of risks, including:

•

difficulty integrating acquired technologies, operations and
    personnel with our existing businesses;

•

diversion of management attention in connection with both
    negotiating the acquisitions and integrating the assets;

•

strain on managerial and operational resources as management
    tries to oversee larger operations;

•

the future funding requirements for acquired companies, which
    may be significant;

•

potential loss of key employees;

•

exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired
    companies; and

•

increased risk of costly and time-consuming litigation.

If we are unable to successfully address these risks, we may not
    realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition,
    which may have an adverse effect on our business plans and
    operating results.

We rely
    on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable
    areas, which could affect the availability of supplies and
    services.

We, like many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on
    internal manufacturing capacity, wafer fabrication foundries and
    other

sub-contractors

in geologically unstable locations around the world. This
    reliance involves risks associated with the impact of
    earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry, including
    temporary loss of capacity, availability and cost of key raw
    materials, utilities and equipment and availability of key
    services, including transport of our products worldwide. Any
    prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing
    facilities, or those of our subcontractors or third-party wafer
    fabrication foundries, as a result of fire, natural disaster,
    unavailability of utilities or otherwise, could result in a
    temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products,
    which could have a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations and financial condition.

We are
    exposed to business, economic, political, legal and other risks
    through our significant worldwide operations.

We have significant operations and manufacturing facilities
    outside the United States, including in Ireland and the
    Philippines. During fiscal 2010, we derived approximately 81% of
    our revenue from customers in international markets. Although we
    engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to
    currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance
    that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by
    changes in the exchange rate of the United States dollar against
    other currencies. Potential interest rate increases, as well as
    high energy costs, could have an adverse impact on industrial
    and consumer spending patterns and could adversely impact demand
    for our products. While a majority of our cash is generated
    outside the United States, we require a substantial amount of
    cash in the United States for operating requirements, stock
    repurchases, cash dividends and acquisitions. If we are unable
    to address our U.S. cash requirements through operations,
    through borrowings under our current credit facility or from
    other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost, our
    business strategies and operating results could be adversely
    affected.

In addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in
    the semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic,
    political and legal risks inherent in international operations,
    including the risks associated with the recent crisis in global
    credit and financial markets, ongoing uncertainties and
    political and economic instability in many countries around the
    world, as well as economic disruption from acts of terrorism and
    the response to them by the United States and its allies. Other
    business risks associated with global operations include
    increased managerial complexities, air transportation
    disruptions, expropriation, currency controls, currency exchange
    rate movement, additional costs related to foreign taxes,
    tariffs and freight rate increases, exposure to different
    business practices and legal standards, particularly with
    respect to price protection, competition practices, intellectual
    property, anti-



corruption and environmental compliance, trade and travel
    restrictions, pandemics, import and export license requirements
    and restrictions, difficulties in staffing and managing
    worldwide operations, and accounts receivable collections.

We expect to continue to expand our business and operations in
    China. Our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely
    affected by China’s continuously evolving laws and
    regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and
    export tariffs, currency controls, environmental regulations,
    anti-corruption, and intellectual property rights and
    enforcement of those rights. Enforcement of existing laws or
    agreements may be inconsistent. In addition, changes in the
    political environment, governmental policies or

U.S.-China

relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or
    their interpretation and enforcement, increased taxation,
    restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations,
    which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and
    operating results.

Our
    operating results are dependent on the performance of
    independent distributors.

A significant portion of our sales are through independent
    distributors that are not under our control. These independent
    distributors generally represent product lines offered by
    several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts
    applied to our products or they could terminate their
    representation of us. We generally do not require letters of
    credit from our distributors and are not protected against
    accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors.
    Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could
    adversely affect our operating results. Termination of a
    significant distributor, whether at our initiative or the
    distributor’s initiative, could disrupt our current
    business, and if we are unable to find suitable replacements,
    our operating results could be adversely affected.

We are
    subject to increasingly strict environmental health and safety
    (EHS) regulations, which could increase our expenses and affect
    our operating results.

Our industry is subject to increasingly strict EHS requirements,
    particularly those environmental requirements that control and
    restrict the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage
    and disposal of certain chemicals used or produced in the
    semiconductor manufacturing process. Public attention to
    environmental concerns continues to increase, and our customers
    routinely include stringent environmental standards in their
    contracts with us. Changes in environmental regulations may
    require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control
    equipment or alter the way our products are made. In addition,
    we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us
    to risks of strict liability for damages caused by releases of
    such materials. Any failure to control such materials adequately
    or to comply with regulatory restrictions or contractual
    obligations could result in penalties, civil and criminal fines,
    and damage our reputation, and might increase our expenses and
    adversely affect our operating results.

New climate change regulations could require us to change our
    manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may
    cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations.
    In addition, new restrictions on carbon dioxide or other
    greenhouse gas emissions could result in significant costs for
    us. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has adopted greenhouse gas
    requirements, and the U.S. Congress may pass federal
    greenhouse gas legislation in the future. The
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is preparing
    greenhouse gas reporting regulations that are likely to apply to
    us. EPA may propose other climate change-based regulations that
    also may increase our expenses and adversely affect our
    operating results. We expect increased worldwide regulatory
    activity relating to climate change in the future. Compliance
    with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on
    our capital expenditures, earnings, financial condition or
    competitive position. There is no assurance that the cost to
    comply with current or future EHS laws and regulations will not
    exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition
    or results of operations. Additionally, any failure by us to
    comply with applicable EHS requirements or contractual
    obligations could result in penalties, civil and criminal fines,
    suspension of or changes to production, legal liability and
    damage to our reputation.

If we are
    unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we may not be able to
    service our debt obligations, including making payments on our
    $375 million senior unsecured notes.

In fiscal 2009, we issued in a public offering $375 million
    aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notes
    due July 1, 2014. Our ability to make payments of principal
    and interest on our indebtedness when



due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject
    to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial,
    business and other factors affecting our consolidated
    operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are
    unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the
    future to service our debt, we may be required to, among other
    things:

•

seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;

•

refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness,
    including the notes;

•

sell selected assets;

•

reduce or delay planned capital expenditures; or

•

reduce or delay planned operating expenditures.

Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service
    our debt, including the notes, which could negatively impact our
    financial results. In addition, any such financing, refinancing
    or sale of assets might not be possible on economically
    favorable terms.

Restrictions
    in our credit facility and outstanding debt instruments may
    limit our activities.

Our current credit facility and our 5.0% senior unsecured
    notes impose, and future debt instruments to which we may become
    subject may impose, restrictions that limit our ability to
    engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company,
    including to undertake certain transactions, to create certain
    liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary
    indebtedness. Our ability to comply with these financial
    restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future
    performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions
    and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control
    such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in
    technology and changes in the level of competition. In addition,
    our credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with
    specified financial ratios. If we breach any of the covenants
    under our credit facility or the indenture governing our
    outstanding notes and do not obtain appropriate waivers, then,
    subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness
    thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable.

Our stock
    price may be volatile.

The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the
    past and may be volatile in the future, as it may be
    significantly affected by the following factors:

•

crises in global credit, debt and financial markets;

•

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating
    results;

•

changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our
    failure to perform in line with those estimates or our published
    guidance;

•

changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies;

•

announcements by us or our competitors of significant new
    products, technical innovations, acquisitions or dispositions,
    litigation or capital commitments;

•

departures of key personnel;

•

actual or perceived noncompliance with corporate responsibility
    or ethics standards by us or any of our employees, officers or
    directors; and

•

negative media publicity targeting us or our competitors.

The stock market has historically experienced volatility,
    especially within the semiconductor industry, that often has
    been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. These
    market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless
    of our operating results.

    of our common stock we are authorized to repurchase under the
    program to $4 billion. On November 19, 2010, our Board
    of Directors authorized the repurchase by us  of an additional
    $1 billion of our common stock under our existing share
    repurchase program. Under the repurchase program, we may
    repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to
    time in the open market and through privately negotiated
    transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our
    Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we
    have repurchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the
    repurchase program.

The number of holders of record of our common stock at
    November 18, 2010 was 2,936. This number does not include

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS (all tabular amounts in thousands except per share
    amounts)

This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations, including in particular the
    section entitled “Outlook,” contains forward-looking
    statements regarding future events and our future results that
    are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act
    of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). These
    statements are based on current expectations, estimates,
    forecasts, and projections about the industries in which we
    operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Words
    such as “expects,” “anticipates,”
    “targets,” “goals,” “projects,”
    “intends,” “plans,” “believes,”
    “seeks,” “estimates,” “continues,”
    “may,” variations of such words and similar
    expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking
    statements. In addition, any statements that refer to
    projections regarding our future financial performance,
    particularly in light of the uncertainty remaining after the
    global credit and financial market crisis over the past two
    years; our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, our
    future capital needs and capital expenditures; our future market
    position and competitive changes in the marketplace for our
    products; our ability to innovate new products and technologies;
    the timing or the effectiveness of our continuing efforts to
    refocus our operations and reduce our cost structure and the
    expected amounts of any cost savings related to those efforts;
    our ability to access credit or capital markets; our ability to
    pay dividends or repurchase stock; our ability to service our
    outstanding debt; our expected tax rate; the future actions of
    our third-party suppliers; our reliance on assembly and test
    subcontractors, third party wafer fabricators and independent
    distributors; the expected outcomes of intellectual property and
    litigation matters; the ability to safeguard our patents and
    intellectual property; potential acquisitions or divestitures;
    the continued availability of key personnel; the global nature
    of our operations; the effect of new accounting pronouncements;
    and other characterizations of future events or circumstances
    are forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned that these
    forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject
    to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to
    predict, including those identified in Part I,
    Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in our Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely
    from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. We
    undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking
    statements except to the extent required by law.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we sold our baseband
    chipset business and related support operations, or Baseband
    Chipset Business, to MediaTek Inc. and sold our CPU voltage
    regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to certain
    subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation. The financial
    results of these businesses are presented as discontinued
    operations in the consolidated statements of income for all
    periods presented. The assets related to these businesses are
    reflected as non-current assets of discontinued operations in
    the consolidated balance sheet as of October 31, 2009.
    Unless otherwise noted, this Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis relates only to financial results from continuing
    operations.

The

year-to-year

revenue changes by end market and product category are more
    fully outlined below under

Revenue Trends by End Market

and

Revenue Trends by Product

.

In fiscal 2010, our revenue increased 37% from fiscal 2009 and
    our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations
    increased from $0.85 to $2.33. Cash flow from operations in
    fiscal 2010 was $991.2 million, or 36% of revenue. In
    addition, we received $216.1 million in net proceeds
    related to employee stock option exercises,



distributed $250 million to our shareholders in dividend
    payments and paid $111.6 million for capital expenditures.
    These factors contributed to the net increase in cash, cash
    equivalents and short-term investments of $871.8 million in
    fiscal 2010.

The

year-to-year

increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 was the
    result of a resurgence in economic activity from the low levels
    achieved during 2009 as a result of the general economic
    downturn following the global credit and financial crisis. The
    strategy we employed during the start of the economic downturn
    to be more focused on products and markets that value innovation
    and to make fundamental improvements to our cost structure aided
    in our growth. Improving macro trends in the industrial,
    communications, automotive and healthcare markets helped, and we
    believe will continue to help, to generate strong growth
    opportunities for us in the future. However, these trends remain
    uncertain and we cannot predict the sustainability of the
    current economic conditions. Consequently, our reported results
    for fiscal 2010 may not be indicative of our future results.

Revenue
    Trends by End Market

The following table summarizes revenue by end market. The
    categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a
    variety of data points including the technical characteristics
    of the product, the “sold to” customer information,
    the “ship to” customer information and the end
    customer product or application into which our product will be
    incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this
    data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end
    market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify
    revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications
    typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the
    underlying trends of results within, each end market.

Industrial —

The

year-to-year

increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in
    industrial end market revenue was primarily the result of a
    broad-based increase in demand in this end market, which was
    most significant for products sold into the instrumentation and
    automation sectors. The

year-to-year

decrease in revenue from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 in
    industrial end market revenue was primarily the result of a
    broad-based decline in demand in this end market, which was most
    significant for products sold into the instrumentation and
    process controls sectors.

Automotive

— The

year-to-year

increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in
    automotive end market revenue was primarily the result of
    increased demand due to various government-initiated incentive
    programs, inventory replenishment and a general increase in the
    electronic content found in vehicles. The

year-to-year

decrease in revenue from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 in
    automotive end market revenue was primarily due to economic
    conditions relating to the global credit crisis resulting in
    cautious customer spending behavior.

Consumer —

The

year-to-year

increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in consumer
    end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad-based
    increase in demand for products used in digital cameras and
    other consumer applications. The

year-to-year

decrease in revenue from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 in consumer
    end market revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in
    demand for products used in home entertainment, digital cameras
    and video game applications, consistent with the global slowdown
    in consumer spending.



Communications —

The

year-to-year

increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in
    communications end market revenue was primarily the result of a
    broad-based increase in demand in this end market, which was
    most significant for the infrastructure sector. The

year-to-year

decrease from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 in communications end
    market revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in sales
    of analog products used in basestations, wireless handsets and
    networking applications.

Revenue
    Trends by Product

The following table summarizes revenue by product categories.
    The categorization of our products into broad categories is
    based on the characteristics of the individual products, the
    specification of the products and in some cases the specific
    uses that certain products have within applications. The
    categorization of products into categories is therefore subject
    to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances
    where products move between product categories we reclassify the
    amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such
    reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing
    of, or the underlying trends of results within, each product
    category.

The increase in total revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010
    was the result of a broad-based increase in sales across all of
    our product categories. The decrease in revenue from fiscal 2008
    to fiscal 2009 was due to declining demand across our product
    categories in every market that we serve, particularly the
    industrial and consumer end markets, as a result of an overall
    decline in the worldwide economy.

Revenue
    Trends by Geographic Region

The percentage of product sales from continuing operations by
    geographic region, based upon point of sale, for the last three
    fiscal years is as follows:

In fiscal year 2010 and 2009, the predominant countries
    comprising “Rest of North and South America” are
    Canada and Mexico; the predominant countries comprising
    “Europe” are Germany, Sweden, France and the
    United Kingdom; and the predominant countries comprising
    “Rest of Asia” are Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore.
    In fiscal year 2008, the predominant countries comprising
    “Rest of North and South America” are Canada and
    Mexico; the predominant countries comprising “Europe”
    are Germany, France and the United Kingdom; and the
    predominant countries comprising “Rest of Asia” are
    Taiwan and South Korea.

Sales increased in all geographic regions in fiscal 2010 as
    compared to fiscal 2009, with sales in Europe and the Rest of
    Asia experiencing the largest increases. The increase in sales
    was the result of an increase in demand for our products
    primarily as a result of improving economic conditions worldwide.

Sales declined in all geographic regions in fiscal 2009, as
    compared to fiscal 2008, with sales in Europe and Japan
    experiencing the largest decline. This decline in sales in
    Europe was partially attributable to a decline in the automotive
    end market. The decline in sales in Japan was principally
    attributable to the general decline in consumer spending as a
    result of the global economic crisis. The decline in China was
    smaller than the decline in the other regions primarily due to
    the strong demand for our products used in China’s recent
    infrastructure build-out of the country’s next generation
    of communication technology.

Gross margin percentage was higher in fiscal 2010 by
    970 basis points as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily as a
    result of an increase in sales of $746.6 million, increased
    operating levels in our manufacturing facilities and the impact
    of ongoing efforts to reduce overall manufacturing costs,
    including the savings realized as a result of wafer fabrication
    facility consolidations. Additionally, a higher proportion of
    our revenues was from products sold into the instrumentation and
    automation sectors of the industrial end market, which earn
    higher margins as compared to products sold into our other end
    markets.

Gross margin percentage was lower in fiscal 2009 by
    560 basis points as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily as a
    result of a decrease in sales of $568.0 million and reduced
    operating levels in our manufacturing facilities that created
    adverse utilization variances.

Research and development, or R&D, expenses in fiscal 2010
    increased $45.3 million, or 10%, from fiscal 2009. The
    increase was primarily the result of an increase in variable
    compensation expense, which is a variable expense linked to our
    overall profitability, partially offset by the impact of actions
    we took over the past two years to control discretionary
    spending and permanently reduce operating expenses.

R&D expenses in fiscal 2009 decreased $86.5 million,
    or 16%, from fiscal 2008. This decrease was primarily the result
    of the actions we took to constrain or permanently reduce
    operating expenses as well as a decrease in variable
    compensation expenses.

R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from

year-to-year

depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new
    product development efforts, which we view as critical to our
    future growth. At any point in time we have hundreds of R&D
    projects underway, and we believe that none of these projects is
    material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the
    development of innovative technologies and processes for new
    products, and we believe that a continued commitment to R&D
    is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our



existing products and to provide innovative new product
    offerings, and therefore we expect to continue to make
    significant R&D investments in the future.

Selling, marketing, general and administrative, or SMG&A,
    expenses in fiscal 2010 increased $57.4 million, or 17%,
    from fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily the result of an
    increase in variable compensation expense, which is a variable
    expense linked to our overall profitability, and higher sales
    commission expenses, which are variable expenses linked to our
    sales. These increases were offset by the impact of actions we
    took over the past two years to control discretionary spending
    and permanently reduce operating expenses.

SMG&A expenses in fiscal 2009 decreased $82.5 million,
    or 20%, from fiscal 2008. This decrease was primarily the result
    of our actions taken to constrain or permanently reduce
    operating expenses as well as a decrease in variable
    compensation expenses.

Stock-based
    Compensation Expense

As of October 30, 2010, the total compensation cost related
    to unvested equity awards not yet recognized in our statement of
    income was approximately $95 million (before tax
    consideration), which we will recognize over a weighted average
    period of 1.4 years.

During fiscal 2009, our shareholders approved and we completed
    an employee stock option exchange program (Option Exchange). The
    Option Exchange provided our eligible employees, excluding our
    named executive officers and directors, the opportunity to
    exchange eligible stock option grants for a smaller number of
    new stock options with a lower exercise price, or in some
    instances cash, that had approximately the same fair value as
    the options surrendered.

See Note 3 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial
    Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for further information on our stock based compensation.

Special
    Charges

The following is a summary of ongoing restructuring actions we
    have taken over the last several years.

Closure
    of Wafer Fabrication Facility in Sunnyvale

We ceased production at our California wafer fabrication
    facility in November 2006. We paid the related lease obligation
    costs on a monthly basis over the remaining lease term, which
    expired in March 2010. We recorded a one-time settlement charge
    of $0.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 related
    to the termination of the lease. This action was completed in
    fiscal 2010.

Consolidation
    of a Wafer Fabrication Facility in Limerick

In fiscal 2007, we recorded a special charge of
    $13.7 million as a result of our decision to only use
    eight-inch technology at our wafer fabrication facility in
    Limerick. Certain manufacturing processes and products produced
    on the Limerick facility’s six-inch production line have
    transitioned to our existing eight-inch production line in
    Limerick while others have transitioned to external foundries.
    The charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded
    in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan for 150
    manufacturing employees associated with this action. We
    terminated the employment of all employees associated with these
    programs and have paid out all amounts owed to employees as
    severance. During fiscal 2008, we recorded an additional charge
    of $1.5 million related to this action, of which
    $1.2 million was an adjustment to the original estimate of
    the severance costs and $0.3 million was for

clean-up

and
    closure costs that we expensed as incurred. During fiscal 2009,
    we recorded additional charges of



$1.2 million for

clean-up

and
    closure costs that we expensed as incurred. The production in
    the six-inch wafer fabrication facility ceased during the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2009. This action was completed in fiscal
    2010. The closure of this facility resulted in annual cost
    savings of approximately $25 million per year, which we
    began realizing in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. These
    savings are recorded in cost of sales, of which approximately
    $1 million relates to non-cash depreciation savings.

Reduction
    of Operating Costs

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, in order to further
    reduce our operating cost structure, we recorded a special
    charge of $1.6 million for severance and fringe benefit
    costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or
    the statutory requirements at foreign locations for 19
    engineering, selling, marketing, general and administrative
    employees.

During fiscal 2009, we recorded an additional charge of
    $30.3 million related to this cost reduction action.
    Approximately $2.1 million of this charge was for lease
    obligation costs for facilities that we ceased using during the
    first quarter of fiscal 2009; approximately $0.8 million
    was for the write-off of property, plant and equipment no longer
    used as a result of this action; and approximately
    $0.5 million was for contract termination costs and
    approximately $0.3 million was for

clean-up

and
    closure costs that we expensed as incurred. The remaining
    $26.6 million related to the severance and fringe benefit
    costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or
    statutory requirements at foreign locations for 245
    manufacturing employees and 302 engineering and SMG&A
    employees. This cost reduction action, which was substantially
    completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2009, resulted in
    annual savings of approximately $36.4 million. These annual
    savings are being realized as follows: approximately
    $31.6 million in SMG&A expenses and approximately
    $4.8 million in cost of sales.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we recorded an
    additional charge of $11.4 million related to the further
    reduction of our operating cost structure. Approximately
    $10.9 million of this charge was for severance and fringe
    benefit costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit
    plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 149
    engineering and SMG&A employees. Approximately
    $0.5 million of the charge relates to our decision to
    abandon efforts to develop a particular expertise in power
    management, resulting in the impairment of related intellectual
    property. When fully implemented in the first quarter of fiscal
    2011, we estimate that these cost reduction actions will result
    in annual savings of approximately $16 million.

We terminated the employment of all employees associated with
    this action and are paying amounts owed to employees for
    severance as income continuance.

Closure
    of a Wafer Fabrication Facility in Cambridge

During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded a special
    charge of $22.1 million as a result of our decision to
    consolidate our Cambridge, Massachusetts wafer fabrication
    facility into our existing Wilmington, Massachusetts facility.
    In connection with the anticipated closure of this facility, we
    evaluated the recoverability of the facility’s
    manufacturing assets and concluded that there was an impairment
    of approximately $12.9 million based on the revised period
    of intended use. The remaining $9.2 million was for
    severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in accordance with
    our ongoing benefit plan for 175 manufacturing employees and 9
    SMG&A employees associated with this action.

We finished production in the Cambridge wafer fabrication
    facility and began

clean-up

activities during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. During the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we reversed approximately
    $1.8 million of our severance accrual. The accrual reversal
    was required because 51 employees either voluntarily left
    the Company or found alternative employment within the Company.
    In addition, we recorded a special charge of approximately
    $1.7 million for the impairment of manufacturing assets
    that were originally going to be moved to our other wafer
    fabrication facilities but are no longer needed at those
    facilities and therefore have no future use. We also recorded a
    special charge of $0.1 million for

clean-up

costs as we began our

clean-up

of
    the Cambridge wafer fabrication facility at the end of the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. We terminated the employment of
    all employees associated with this charge and are paying amounts
    owed to employees for severance as income continuance. We
    estimate that this action will result in annual cost savings of
    approximately $41 million per year, which we began
    realizing in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. We expect these
    annual savings to be realized as follows: approximately
    $40.2 million



in cost of sales, of which approximately $4.0 million
    relates to non-cash depreciation savings, and approximately
    $0.8 million relates to SMG&A expenses.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we recorded an
    additional charge of $4.7 million related to this cost
    reduction action. Approximately $3.4 million of the charge
    related to lease obligation costs for the Cambridge wafer
    fabrication facility, which we ceased using in the first quarter
    of fiscal 2010, and the remaining $1.3 million of the
    charge related to

clean-up

and
    closure costs. These cost reductions resulted in annual savings
    of approximately $2.4 million, which we began realizing in
    the first quarter of fiscal 2010.

The $615.3 million, or 216%, increase in operating income
    from continuing operations in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal
    2009 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue of
    $746.6 million, a 970 basis point increase in gross
    margin percentage, and lower special charges recorded in fiscal
    2010 as compared to fiscal 2009.

The $340.2 million, or 54%, decrease in operating income
    from continuing operations in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal
    2008 was primarily the result of a decrease in revenue of
    $568.0 million, a 560 basis point decrease in gross
    margin percentage and an increase of $50.6 million in
    special charges. This decrease in operating income from
    continuing operations was partially offset by a decrease in
    R&D and SMG&A expenses as more fully described above
    under the headings

Nonoperating income was lower by $11 million in fiscal 2010
    as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to higher interest
    expense incurred during fiscal 2010 as a result of the issuance
    of $375 million aggregate principal 5.0% senior
    unsecured notes on June 30, 2009 resulting in a partial
    year of interest expense in 2009 compared to a full year in
    2010. In addition, we earned lower interest income on
    investments as a result of lower interest rates in fiscal 2010
    as compared to fiscal 2009.

Nonoperating income was lower by $28.5 million in fiscal
    2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to lower interest
    income earned on investments as a result of lower interest rates
    in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. In addition, we
    incurred interest expense during fiscal 2009 as a result of the
    issuance of $375 million aggregate principal
    5.0% senior unsecured notes on June 30, 2009. We
    entered into an interest rate swap in June 2009 that swaps the
    fixed rate of the notes to a variable rate based on the
    three-month LIBOR plus 2.05%.

Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in

    our income is earned.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was higher compared to
    our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of
    a change in the mix of our income to jurisdictions where income
    is taxed at a higher rate. In addition, higher special charges
    recorded in fiscal 2009, a majority of which provided a tax
    benefit at the higher U.S. tax rate contributed to a higher
    effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was lower compared to our
    effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 primarily as a result of our
    recording special charges of $53.7 million in fiscal 2009,
    a majority of which provided a tax benefit at the higher
    U.S. tax rate, and as a result of a change in the mix of
    our income to jurisdictions where income is taxed at a lower
    rate.

    fiscal 2010.

Income from continuing operations, net of tax, in fiscal 2009

We sold our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc. and our

    certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation during the
    first quarter of fiscal 2008. Accordingly, the results of the
    operations of these businesses have been presented as
    discontinued operations within the consolidated financial
    statements.

Acquisitions

In fiscal 2006, we acquired substantially all the outstanding
    stock of privately-held Integrant Technologies, Inc. (Integrant)
    of Seoul, Korea. The acquisition enabled us to enter the mobile
    TV market and strengthened our presence in the Asia region. We
    paid $8.4 million related to the purchase of shares from
    the founder of Integrant during the period from July 2007
    through July 2009. We recorded these payments as additional
    goodwill.

In fiscal 2006, we acquired all the outstanding stock of
    privately-held AudioAsics A/S (AudioAsics) of Roskilde, Denmark.
    The acquisition of AudioAsics allows us to continue developing
    low-power audio solutions, while expanding our presence in the
    Nordic and Eastern European regions. We paid additional cash
    payments of



$3.1 million during fiscal 2009 for the achievement of
    revenue-based milestones during the period from October 2006
    through January 2009, which we recorded as additional goodwill.
    In addition, in accordance with the terms of the acquisition
    documents, we paid $3.2 million during fiscal 2009 based on
    the achievement of technological milestones during the period
    from October 2006 through January 2009, which we recorded as
    compensation expense in fiscal 2008. All revenue and
    technological milestones related to this acquisition have been
    met and no additional payments will be made.

We have not provided pro forma results of operations for
    Integrant and AudioAsics in this report as they were not
    material to us on either an individual or an aggregate basis. We
    included the results of operations of each acquisition in our
    consolidated statement of income from the date of such
    acquisition.

At October 30, 2010, cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments totaled $2,687.8 million, an increase of
    $871.8 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The
    primary sources of funds for fiscal 2010 were net cash generated
    from operating activities of $991.2 million and
    $216.1 million in net proceeds from employee stock option
    exercises. The principal uses of funds for fiscal 2010 were
    dividend payments of $250.0 million and capital
    expenditures of $111.6 million.

We sold our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc. and our
    CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring business to
    certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation during the
    first quarter of fiscal 2008. The cash flows from these
    discontinued operations have been combined with the operating,
    investing and financing cash flows from continuing operations
    (i.e. no separate classification of cash flows from discontinued
    operations) for all periods presented. We believe the absence of
    the cash flows from these discontinued operations has not and
    will not have a material impact on our future liquidity and
    financial position. Additionally, as a result of these
    dispositions, we reclassified certain assets and liabilities
    related to these businesses to assets or liabilities of
    discontinued operations. See Note 2u. in the Notes to our
    Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

We use the annualized fourth quarter revenue in our calculation
    of days sales outstanding and we use the annualized fourth
    quarter cost of sales in our calculation of days cost of sales
    in inventory.

Accounts receivable at October 30, 2010 increased
    $86.1 million, or 29%, from the end of the fourth quarter
    of fiscal 2009. The increase in receivables was the result of
    higher revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 as compared
    to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.

Inventory at October 30, 2010 increased by
    $24.3 million, or 10%, from the end of the fourth quarter
    of fiscal 2009. The increase in inventory relates primarily to
    an increase in manufacturing production to support higher sales
    demand.

Current liabilities increased to $643.5 million at
    October 30, 2010, an increase of $256.9 million, or
    66%, from $386.6 million at the end of fiscal 2009. This
    increase was primarily due to higher deferred income on
    shipments to distributors in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal
    2009, and an increase in accrued liabilities relating to
    variable



compensation expense. In addition, income taxes payable
    increased in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 as a result
    of higher profits and a change in the mix of our income to
    jurisdictions where income is taxed at a higher rate.

Net additions to property, plant and equipment including
    discontinued operations were $111.6 million in fiscal 2010,
    $56.1 million in fiscal 2009 and $157.4 million in
    fiscal 2008. We expect fiscal 2011 capital expenditures to be in
    the range of $120 million to $130 million.

During fiscal 2010, our Board of Directors declared cash
    dividends totaling $0.84 per outstanding share of common stock
    resulting in aggregate dividend payments of $250.0 million.
    After the end of fiscal 2010, on November 19, 2010, our
    Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per
    outstanding share of our common stock. The dividend is payable
    on December 22, 2010 to shareholders of record on
    December 3, 2010 and is expected to total approximately
    $66 million. We currently expect quarterly dividends to
    continue at $0.22 per share, although they remain subject to
    declaration by our Board of Directors. The payment of future
    dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including
    our financial performance, outlook and liquidity.

Our common stock repurchase program has been in place since
    August 2004. In the aggregate, the Board of Directors has
    authorized us to repurchase $4 billion of our common stock
    under the program. Under the program, we may repurchase
    outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the
    open market and through privately negotiated transactions.
    Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of
    Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have
    repurchased all shares authorized under the program. As of
    October 30, 2010, we had repurchased a total of
    approximately 116.0 million shares of our common stock for
    approximately $3,948.2 million under this program. As of
    October 30, 2010, an additional $51.8 million remained
    available for repurchase of shares under the current authorized
    program. On November 19, 2010, our Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase by us of an additional $1 billion
    of our common stock under our existing share repurchase program.
    The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued
    shares of common stock. We also from time to time repurchase
    shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due
    upon the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units
    or the exercise of stock options, or in certain limited
    circumstances to satisfy the exercise price of options granted
    to our employees under our equity compensation plans. Any future
    common stock repurchases will be based on several factors
    including our financial performance, outlook, liquidity and the
    amount of cash we have available in the United States.

On June 30, 2009, we issued $375 million aggregate
    principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notes due
    July 1, 2014 (the Notes) with annual interest payments of
    5.0% paid in two installments on January 1 and July 1 of each
    year, commencing January 1, 2010. The net proceeds of the
    offering were $370.4 million, after issuing at a discount
    and deducting expenses, underwriting discounts and commissions,
    which will be amortized over the term of the Notes. We swapped
    the fixed interest portion of these Notes for a variable
    interest rate based on the three-month LIBOR plus 2.05% (2.34%
    as of October 30, 2010). The variable interest payments
    based on the variable annual rate are payable quarterly. The
    LIBOR based rate is set quarterly three months prior to the date
    of the interest payment. The indenture governing the Notes
    contains covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create,
    assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a
    lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease-back
    transactions with respect to a principal property; and
    consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or
    substantially all of our assets to any other party. In addition,
    we have a five-year $165 million unsecured revolving credit
    facility that expires in May 2013. To date, we have not borrowed
    under this credit facility but we may borrow in the future and
    use the proceeds for support of commercial paper issuance, stock
    repurchases, dividend payments, acquisitions, capital
    expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate
    purposes.

At October 30, 2010, our principal source of liquidity was
    $2,687.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and
    short-term investments. As of October 30, 2010,
    approximately $725.4 million of our cash and cash
    equivalents and short-term investments was held in the United
    States. The balance of our cash and cash equivalents and
    short-term investments was held outside the United States in
    various foreign subsidiaries. As we intend to reinvest certain
    of our foreign earnings indefinitely, this cash held outside the
    United States is not available to meet certain of our cash
    requirements in the United States, including for cash dividends
    and common stock repurchases.

The volatility in the credit markets has generally diminished
    liquidity and capital availability in worldwide markets. While
    there are signs that conditions may be improving, there is no
    certainty that the current tentative recovery in credit and
    financial markets will continue. We are unable to predict the
    likely duration of the tentative



recovery in the credit and financial markets. However, we
    believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected
    to be generated from future operations, together with existing
    and anticipated available long-term financing, will be
    sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research
    and development efforts, dividend payments (if any) and
    purchases of stock (if any) under our stock repurchase program
    in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months.

Purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other
    goods and services are not included in the table above. We are
    not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders
    that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may
    represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding
    agreements. In addition, our purchase orders generally allow for
    cancellation without significant penalties. We do not have
    significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or
    other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that
    exceed our expected short-term requirements.

As of October 30, 2010, our total liabilities associated
    with uncertain tax positions was $28.3 million, which are
    included in “Other non-current liabilities” in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheet contained in Item 8 of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties, we
    cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in
    which we expect to settle the non-current liabilities associated
    with these uncertain



tax positions. Therefore, we have not included these uncertain
    tax positions in the above contractual obligations table.

The expected timing of payments and the amounts of the
    obligations discussed above are estimated based on current
    information available as of October 30, 2010.

Off-balance
    Sheet Financing

As of October 30, 2010, we had no off-balance sheet
    financing arrangements.

Outlook

The following statements are based on current expectations.
    These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may
    differ materially. Unless specifically mentioned, these
    statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any
    mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or business combinations
    that may be announced or closed after the date of filing this
    report. These statements supersede all prior statements
    regarding our business outlook made by us.

We are planning for revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2011
    to be in the range of $715 million to $740 million.
    Our plan is for gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal
    2011 to be approximately 66%. We are planning for operating
    margins in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 to be in the range
    of 34.5% to 35.5%. As a result, our plan is for diluted EPS from
    continuing operations to be approximately $0.63 to $0.67 in the
    first quarter of fiscal 2011.

New

Revenue
    Arrangements That Include Software Elements

In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)

No. 2009-14 —

Software (Topic 985): Certain Revenue Arrangements That
    Include Software Elements

(formerly EITF Issue

No. 09-3).

This standard removes tangible products from the scope of
    software revenue recognition guidance and also provides guidance
    on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement
    that includes a tangible product are within the scope of the
    software revenue guidance. More specifically, if the software
    sold with or embedded within the tangible product is essential
    to the functionality of the tangible product, then this
    software, as well as undelivered software elements that relate
    to this software, are excluded from the scope of existing
    software revenue guidance. ASU

No. 2009-14

is effective for fiscal years that begin on or after
    June 15, 2010, which is our fiscal year 2011. We are
    currently evaluating the impact, if any, that ASU

No. 2009-14

may have on our financial condition and results of operations.

Multiple-Deliverable
    Revenue Arrangements

In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2009-13 —

Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue
    Arrangements

(formerly EITF Issue

No. 08-1).

This standard modifies the revenue recognition guidance for
    arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple elements,
    such as product, software, services or support, to a customer at
    different times as part of a single revenue generating
    transaction. This standard provides principles and application
    guidance to determine whether multiple deliverables exist, how
    the individual deliverables should be separated and how to
    allocate the revenue in the arrangement among those separate
    deliverables. The standard also expands the disclosure
    requirements for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements. ASU

No. 2009-13

is effective for fiscal years that begin on or after
    June 15, 2010, which is our fiscal year 2011. We are
    currently evaluating the impact, if any, that ASU

No. 2009-13

may have on our financial condition and results of operations.

Variable
    Interest Entities

In December 2009, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2009-17 —

Consolidations (Topic 810): Improvements to Financial
    Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest
    Entities

, which amends ASC 810,

Consolidation

.
    This standard requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to
    determine whether the enterprise’s variable



interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest
    in a variable interest entity. Additionally, an enterprise is
    required to assess whether it has an implicit financial
    responsibility to ensure that a variable interest entity
    operates as designed when determining whether it has the power
    to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that
    most significantly impact the entity’s economic
    performance. ASU

No. 2009-17

is effective for fiscal years that begin after November 15,
    2009, which is our fiscal year 2011. We are currently evaluating
    the impact, if any, that ASU

No. 2009-17

may have on our financial condition and results of operations.

Transfers
    of Financial Assets

In June 2009, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2009-16,

Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets,

(Topic
    820). This standard changes the way entities account for
    securitizations and other transfers of financial instruments.
    ASU

No. 2009-16

is effective for fiscal years that begin after November 15,

    the impact, if any, that ASU

No. 2009-16

may have on our financial condition and results of operations.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of the financial
    condition and results of operations is based upon the
    consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
    accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles. The preparation of these financial statements
    requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
    reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses,
    and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We
    base our estimates and judgments on historical experience,
    knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur
    in the future based on available information. We consider the
    following accounting policies to be both those most important to
    the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require
    the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ
    significantly from management’s estimates and projections,
    there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We
    also have other policies that we consider key accounting
    policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including
    the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the
    products are sold to the end user; however, the application of
    these policies does not require us to make significant estimates
    or judgments that are difficult or subjective.

Inventory
    Valuation

We value inventories at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of
    the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels,
    obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write
    down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of
    methodologies to determine the net realizable value of
    inventory. While a portion of the calculation is determined via
    reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market
    calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to
    significant judgments made by us about future demand for our
    inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our
    estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may
    need to be recorded in future periods. To date, our actual
    results have not been materially different than our estimates,
    and we do not expect them to be materially different in the
    future.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate,
    for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our
    customers to make required payments. If the financial condition
    of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may
    exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be
    required. To date, our actual results have not been materially
    different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be
    materially different in the future.

Long-Lived
    Assets

We review property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets
    for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be
    recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by
    comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash
    flows that the assets are expected to generate over their
    remaining economic lives. If such assets are considered to be
    impaired, the impairment to be



recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying
    value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by
    either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by
    utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have
    recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our
    property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets
    during the past three fiscal years, except those made in
    conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our
    business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments
    in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets
    requires estimates of future operating results that are used in
    the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows.
    Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives
    of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in
    assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences
    could result in impairment charges, which could have a material
    adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in
    certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their
    estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations,
    we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised
    useful lives.

Goodwill

Goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more
    frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and
    suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be
    recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. We test
    goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating
    segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual
    basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if we believe
    indicators of impairment exist. The performance of the test
    involves a two-step process. The first step of the impairment
    test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable
    reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including
    goodwill. We generally determine the fair value of our reporting
    units using the income approach methodology of valuation that
    includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other
    generally accepted valuation methodologies, which requires
    significant judgment by management. If the carrying amount of a
    reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, we
    perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to
    determine the amount of impairment loss. The second step of the
    goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair
    value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the
    carrying value of that goodwill. These impairment tests may
    result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse
    impact on our results of operations.

Accounting
    for Income Taxes

We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining
    income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These
    estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits,
    benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax
    assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the
    timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and
    financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and
    penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. We assessed
    the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and
    concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the
    amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due
    to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization
    of certain state credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion,
    we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence
    of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred
    tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the
    impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net
    operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our
    judgments regarding future profitability may change due to
    future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international
    tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require
    material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in
    a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the
    period when such determinations are made, which in turn, may
    result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a
    subsequent period.

On November 4, 2007 (the first day of our 2008 fiscal
    year), we adopted new accounting principles on accounting for
    uncertain tax positions. These principles requires companies to
    determine that it is “more likely than not” that a tax
    position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities
    before any benefit can be recorded in the financial statements.
    An uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has
    less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. For those tax
    positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit
    will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax
    benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being
    realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that
    has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income
    tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax
    benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in
    the financial statements. We reevaluate these uncertain tax
    positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on



factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or
    circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues
    under audit, and new audit activity. A change in these factors
    would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an
    additional charge to the tax provision.

In the ordinary course of global business, there are many
    transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is
    uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of
    cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related
    entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no
    assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these
    matters will not be different than that which is reflected in
    our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In the event
    our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a
    material impact on our income tax provision and operating
    results in the period in which such determination is made. In
    addition to the factors described above, our current and
    expected effective tax rate is based on then-current tax law.
    Significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could
    affect these estimates.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options
    and related awards is recognized in the statement of income.
    Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be
    recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in
    calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options. We
    calculate the grant-date fair values using the Black-Scholes
    valuation model. The use of valuation models requires us to make
    estimates of the following assumptions:

Expected volatility

— We are responsible for
    estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors,
    including third-party estimates, when estimating volatility. We
    currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility
    results in the best estimate of the grant-date fair value of
    employee stock options because it reflects the market’s
    current expectations of future volatility. In evaluating the
    appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility, we
    concluded that: (1) options in our common stock are
    actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges;
    (2) the market prices of both the traded options and the
    underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to
    each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee
    share options; (3) the traded options have exercise prices
    that are both

near-the-money

and close to the exercise price of the employee share options;
    and (4) the maturities of the traded options used to
    estimate volatility are at least one year.

Expected term

— We use historical employee
    exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected
    term assumption for the Black-Scholes grant-date valuation. We
    believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate
    of the expected term of a new option, and that generally, all of
    our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior. In general, the
    longer the expected term used in the Black-Scholes valuation
    model, the higher the grant-date fair value of the option.

Risk-free interest rate

— The yield on
    zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is
    commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the
    risk-free interest rate.

Expected dividend yield

— Expected dividend
    yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by
    our Board of Directors for the current quarter and dividing that
    result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the
    option. Until such time as our Board of Directors declares a
    cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current
    quarter’s cash dividend, the current dividend will be used
    in deriving this assumption. Cash dividends are not paid on
    options, restricted stock or restricted stock units.

The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized during
    a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that
    are ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated at
    the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent
    periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The
    term “forfeitures” is distinct from
    “cancellations” or “expirations” and
    represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option.
    Based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures, we have
    applied an annual forfeiture rate of 4.3% to all unvested
    stock-based awards as of October 30, 2010. The rate of 4.3%
    represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each
    year over the vesting period. This analysis is re-evaluated
    quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary.
    Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting
    period will only be for those awards that vest.



Contingencies

From time to time, we receive demands from third parties
    alleging that our products or manufacturing processes infringe
    the patent or intellectual property rights of these parties. We
    periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent
    liability should be recorded. In making this determination, we
    may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with
    internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based
    on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment
    regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we
    determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be
    incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably
    estimated. If a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we
    record a contingent loss. In determining the amount of a
    contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the
    specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement
    negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other
    factors. If the judgments and estimates made by us are
    incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses
    that could materially adversely impact our results of operations.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest
    Rate Exposure

Based on our marketable securities and short term investments
    outstanding as of October 30, 2010 and October 31,
    2009, our annual interest income would change by approximately
    $27 million and $18 million, respectively, for each
    100 basis point increase in interest rates.

To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk
    associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a
    sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in
    interest rates would have on the value of our investment
    portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the
    yield curve. Based on investment positions as of
    October 30, 2010, a hypothetical 100 basis point
    increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in
    a $4 million incremental decline in the fair market value
    of the portfolio. As of October 31, 2009, a similar
    100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have
    resulted in approximately $3 million of incremental decline
    in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would
    only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity.

In June 2009, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to
    hedge the benchmark interest rate of our $375 million
    5.0% senior unsecured notes due July 1, 2014. The
    effect of the swap was to convert our 5.0% fixed interest rate
    to a variable interest rate based on the three-month LIBOR plus
    2.05% (2.34% as of October 30, 2010). If LIBOR changes by
    100 basis points, our annual interest expense would change
    by approximately $4 million.

Foreign
    Currency Exposure

As more fully described in Note 2i. in the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

we regularly hedge our

non-U.S. dollar-based

exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange
    contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching
    the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from
    one month to twelve months. Currently, our largest foreign
    currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European
    operations have the highest proportion of our local currency
    denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures
    existing at October 30, 2010 and October 31, 2009, a
    10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over
    the course of the year would expose us to approximately
    $6 million in losses in earnings or cash flows.

The market risk associated with our derivative instruments
    results from currency exchange rate or interest rate movements
    that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying
    transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. The
    counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign
    exchange instruments consist of a number of major international
    financial institutions with high credit ratings. We do not
    believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by
    these counterparties because we continually monitor the credit
    ratings of such counterparties. While the contract or notional
    amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure
    of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the
    amount of our exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially
    subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of
    counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are
    generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the
    counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed our
    obligations to the counterparties.



The following table illustrates the effect that a 10%
    unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange
    rates, relative to the U.S. dollar, would have on the fair
    value of our forward exchange contracts as of October 30,
    2010 and October 31, 2009:

The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in
    the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition
    to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes
    typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency
    sales price as competitors’ products become more or less
    attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes
    in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a
    potential change in sales levels or local currency selling
    prices.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

a.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and all of its subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all
    intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Certain
    amounts reported in previous years have been reclassified to
    conform to the fiscal 2010 presentation. Such reclassified
    amounts were immaterial. The Company’s fiscal year is the
    52-week or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to the
    last day in October. Fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 were
    52-week periods.

The Company sold its baseband chipset business and related
    support operations (Baseband Chipset Business) to MediaTek Inc.
    and its CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring
    business to certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation
    during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The Company has
    reflected the financial results of these businesses as
    discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income
    for all periods presented. The assets of these businesses are
    reflected as non-current assets of discontinued operations in
    the consolidated balance sheet as of October 31, 2009. The
    historical results of operations of these businesses have been
    segregated from the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements and are included in income from discontinued
    operations, net of tax, in the consolidated statements of income.

b.

Cash,
    Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments

Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with
    insignificant interest rate risk and maturities of three months
    or less at the time of acquisition. Cash, cash equivalents and
    short-term investments consist primarily of corporate
    obligations such as commercial paper and corporate bonds and
    institutional money market funds. They also include bank time
    deposits.

The Company classifies its investments in readily marketable
    debt and equity securities as

“held-to-maturity,”

“available-for-sale”

or “trading” at the time of purchase. There were no
    transfers between investment classifications



ANALOG
    DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

in any of the fiscal years presented.

Held-to-maturity

securities, which are carried at amortized cost, include only
    those securities the Company has the positive intent and ability
    to hold to maturity. Securities, such as bank time deposits,
    which by their nature are typically held to maturity, are
    classified as such. The Company’s other readily marketable
    cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as

available-for-sale.

Available-for-sale

securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and
    losses, net of related tax, reported in accumulated other
    comprehensive (loss) income.

The Company’s deferred compensation plan investments are
    classified as trading. See Note 7 for additional
    information on the Company’s deferred compensation plan
    investments. There were no cash equivalents or short-term
    investments classified as trading at October 30, 2010 and
    October 31, 2009.

The Company periodically evaluates its investments for
    impairment. There were no

other-than-temporary

impairments of short-term investments in any of the fiscal years
    presented.

No realized gains or losses were recorded during any of the
    fiscal years presented.

Unrealized gains and losses on

available-for-sale

securities classified as short-term investments at
    October 30, 2010 and October 31, 2009 are as follows:

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out method) or market. The valuation of inventory requires
    the Company to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as
    inventory that is not of saleable quality. The Company employs a
    variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value
    of its inventory. While a portion of the calculation to record
    inventory at its net realizable value is based on the age of the
    inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, a key factor
    in estimating obsolete or excess inventory requires the Company
    to estimate the future demand for its products. If actual demand
    is less than the Company’s estimates, impairment charges,
    which are recorded to cost of sales, may need to be recorded in
    future periods. Inventory in excess of saleable amounts is not
    valued, and the remaining inventory is valued at the lower of
    cost or market.

Inventories at October 30, 2010 and October 31, 2009
    are as follows:

e.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost less
    allowances for depreciation. The straight-line method of
    depreciation is used for all classes of assets for financial
    statement purposes; both straight-line and accelerated methods
    are used for income tax purposes. Leasehold improvements are
    amortized based upon the lesser of the term of the lease or the
    useful life of the asset. Repairs and maintenance charges are
    expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are based on
    the following useful lives:

Buildings & building equipment

Up to 25 years

Machinery & equipment

3-8 years

Office equipment

3-8 years

Depreciation expense from continuing operations of property,
    plant and equipment was $116.1 million, $132.5 million
    and $144.2 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable.
    Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of
    their carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows the
    assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic
    lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
    impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by
    which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value
    determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value
    determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. If
    such assets are not impaired, but their useful lives have
    decreased, the remaining net book value is amortized over the
    revised useful life.

f.

Goodwill
    and Intangible Assets

Goodwill

The Company annually evaluates goodwill for impairment as well
    as whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the
    carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company
    tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level
    (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on
    an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if
    indicators of impairment exist. The performance of the test
    involves a two-step process. The first step of the impairment
    test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable



ANALOG
    DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including
    goodwill. The Company determines the fair value of its reporting
    units using the income approach methodology of valuation that
    includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other
    generally accepted valuation methodologies. If the carrying
    amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s
    fair value, the Company performs the second step of the goodwill
    impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. The
    second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing
    the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s
    goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. No impairment
    of goodwill resulted from the Company’s most recent
    evaluation, which occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.
    No impairment of goodwill resulted in any of the fiscal years
    presented. The Company’s next annual impairment assessment
    will be made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 unless
    indicators arise that would require the Company to reevaluate at
    an earlier date. The following table presents the changes in
    goodwill during fiscal 2010 and 2009:

Intangible
    Assets

The Company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability
    of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying
    value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected
    to generate over their remaining economic lives. If such assets
    are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized
    in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the
    assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted
    market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a
    discounted cash flow technique.

    amortization that is expected to reflect the estimated pattern
    of economic use. The remaining amortization expense will be
    recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately
    0.6 years.

Amortization expense from continuing operations related to
    intangibles was $4.8 million, $7.4 million and
    $9.3 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Grant
    Accounting

Certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries have received
    various grants from governmental agencies. These grants include
    capital, employment and research and development grants. Capital
    grants for the acquisition of property and equipment are netted
    against the related capital expenditures and amortized as a
    credit to depreciation expense over the useful life of the
    related asset. Employment grants, which relate to employee
    hiring and training, and research and development grants are
    recognized in earnings in the period in which the related
    expenditures are incurred by the Company.

h.

Translation
    of Foreign Currencies

The functional currency for the Company’s foreign sales and
    research and development operations is the applicable local
    currency. Gains and losses resulting from translation of these
    foreign currencies into U.S. dollars are recorded in
    accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. Transaction gains
    and losses and remeasurement of foreign currency denominated
    assets and liabilities are included in income currently,
    including those at the Company’s principal foreign
    manufacturing operations where the functional currency is the
    U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses
    included in other expenses, net, were not material in fiscal
    2010, 2009 or 2008.

i.

Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Agreements

Foreign Exchange Exposure Management

— The
    Company enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts
    to offset certain operational and balance sheet exposures from
    the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Such
    exposures result from the portion of the Company’s
    operations, assets and liabilities that are denominated in
    currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro;
    other exposures include the Philippine Peso and the British
    Pound. These foreign currency exchange contracts are entered
    into to support transactions made in the normal course of
    business, and accordingly, are not speculative in nature. The
    contracts are for periods consistent with the terms of the
    underlying transactions, generally one year or less. Hedges
    related to anticipated transactions are designated and
    documented at the inception of the respective hedges as cash
    flow hedges and are evaluated for effectiveness monthly.
    Derivative instruments are employed to eliminate or minimize
    certain foreign currency exposures that can be confidently
    identified and quantified. As the terms of the contract and the
    underlying transaction are matched at inception, forward
    contract effectiveness is calculated by comparing the change in
    fair value of the contract to the change in the forward value of
    the anticipated transaction, with the effective portion of the
    gain or loss on the derivative instrument reported as a
    component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income (OCI)
    in shareholders’ equity and reclassified into earnings in
    the same period during which the hedged transaction affects
    earnings. Any residual change in fair value of the instruments,
    or ineffectiveness, is recognized immediately in other (income)
    expense. Additionally, the Company enters into forward foreign
    currency contracts that economically hedge the gains and losses
    generated by the remeasurement of certain recorded assets and
    liabilities in a non-functional currency. Changes in the fair
    value of these undesignated hedges are recognized in other
    (income) expense immediately as an offset to the changes in the
    fair value of the asset or liability being hedged. As of
    October 30, 2010 and October 31, 2009, the total
    notional amount of these undesignated hedges was
    $42.1 million and $38 million, respectively. The fair
    value of these hedging instruments in the Company’s
    condensed consolidated balance sheets as of October 30,
    2010 and October 31, 2009 was immaterial.

Interest Rate Exposure Management

— On
    June 30, 2009, the Company entered into interest rate swap
    transactions related to its outstanding 5% senior unsecured
    notes where the Company swapped the notional amount of its
    $375 million of fixed rate debt at 5.0% into floating
    interest rate debt through July 1, 2014. Under the terms of

paid in two installments on the 1st of every January and
    July, commencing January 1, 2010 through and ending on the
    maturity date; and (ii) pay on the $375 million
    notional amount an annual three-month LIBOR plus 2.05% (2.34% as
    of October 30, 2010) interest payment, payable in four
    installments on the 1st of every January, April, July and
    October, commencing on October 1, 2009 and ending on the
    maturity date. The LIBOR-based rate is set quarterly three
    months prior to the date of the interest payment. The Company
    designated these swaps as fair value hedges. The fair value of
    the swaps at inception was zero and subsequent changes in the
    fair value of the interest rate swaps were reflected in the
    carrying value of the interest rate swaps on the balance sheet.
    The carrying value of the debt on the balance sheet was adjusted
    by an equal and offsetting amount. The gain or loss on the
    hedged item (that is fixed-rate borrowings) attributable to the
    hedged benchmark interest rate risk and the offsetting gain or
    loss on the related interest rate swaps for fiscal year 2010 and
    fiscal year 2009 are as follows:

The amounts earned and owed under the swap agreements are
    accrued each period and are reported in interest expense. There
    was no ineffectiveness recognized in any of the periods
    presented.

The market risk associated with the Company’s derivative
    instruments results from currency exchange rate or interest rate
    movements that are expected to offset the market risk of the
    underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged.
    The counterparties to the agreements relating to the
    Company’s derivative instruments consist of a number of
    major international financial institutions with high credit
    ratings. The Company does not believe that there is significant
    risk of nonperformance by these counterparties because the
    Company continually monitors the credit ratings of such
    counterparties. Furthermore, none of the Company’s
    derivative transactions are subject to collateral or other
    security arrangements and none contain provisions that are
    dependent on the Company’s credit ratings from any credit
    rating agency. While the contract or notional amounts of
    derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the
    volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount
    of the Company’s exposure to credit risk. The amounts
    potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible
    inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their
    contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by
    which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts
    exceed the obligations of the Company to the counterparties. As
    a result of the above considerations, the Company does not
    consider the risk of counterparty default to be significant.

The Company records the fair value of its derivative financial
    instruments in the consolidated financial statements in other
    current assets, other assets or accrued liabilities, depending
    on their net position, regardless of the purpose or intent for
    holding the derivative contract. Changes in the fair value of
    the derivative financial instruments are either recognized
    periodically in earnings or in shareholders’ equity as a
    component of OCI. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges
    are recorded in OCI and reclassified into earnings when the
    underlying contract matures. Changes in the fair values of
    derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting are reported in
    earnings as they occur.

The total notional amount of derivative instruments designated
    as hedging instruments as of October 30, 2010 and
    October 31, 2009 was as follows: $375 million of
    interest rate swap agreements accounted for as fair value
    hedges, and $140 million and $128 million,
    respectively, of cash flow hedges denominated in Euros, British
    Pounds and Philippine Pesos. The fair value of these hedging
    instruments in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance

Fair
    Value

The Company defines fair value as the price that would be
    received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
    orderly transaction between market participants at the
    measurement date. The Company applies the following fair value
    hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair
    value into three levels and bases the categorization within the
    hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and
    significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy gives
    the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active
    markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1
    measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs
    (Level 3 measurements).

Level 1

— Level 1 inputs are quoted
    prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
    liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access
    at the measurement date.

Level 2

— Level 2 inputs are inputs
    other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are
    observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
    indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified
    (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for
    substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

Level 3

— Level 3 inputs are
    unobservable inputs for the asset or liability in which there is
    little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at
    the measurement date. As of October 30, 2010 and
    October 31, 2009 the Company held no assets or liabilities
    valued using Level 3 inputs.

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company
    in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial
    instruments:

Cash equivalents and short-term

    using a yield curve model based on current market rates.

Deferred compensation plan investments and other
    investments

— The fair value of these mutual
    fund, money market fund and equity investments are based on
    quoted market prices.

Long-term debt

— The fair value of
    long-term debt is based on quotes received from third party
    banks.

Interest rate swap agreements

— The fair
    value of interest rate swap agreements is based on quotes
    received from third party banks. These values represent the
    estimated amount the Company would receive or pay to terminate
    the agreements taking into consideration current interest rates
    as well as the creditworthiness of the counterparty.

Forward foreign currency exchange
    contracts

— The estimated fair value of
    forward foreign currency exchange contracts, which includes
    derivatives that are accounted for as cash flow hedges and those
    that are not designated as cash flow hedges, is based on the
    estimated amount the Company would receive if it sold these
    agreements at the reporting date taking into consideration
    current interest rates as well as the creditworthiness of the
    counterparty for assets and the Company’s creditworthiness
    for liabilities.

k.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial
    statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
    during the reporting period. Such estimates relate to the useful
    lives of fixed assets and identified intangible assets,
    allowances for doubtful accounts and customer returns, the net
    realizable value of inventory, potential reserves relating to
    litigation matters, accrued liabilities, accrued taxes, deferred
    tax valuation allowances, assumptions pertaining to share-based
    payments and other reserves. Actual results could differ from
    those estimates and such differences may be material to the
    financial statements.

l.

Concentrations
    of Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
    concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments
    and trade accounts receivable.

The Company maintains cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments and long-term investments with high credit quality
    financial institutions and monitors the amount of credit
    exposure to any one issuer.

The Company sells its products to distributors and original
    equipment manufacturers involved in a variety of industries
    including industrial process automation, instrumentation,
    defense/aerospace, automotive, communications, computers and
    computer peripherals and consumer electronics. The Company has
    adopted credit policies and standards to accommodate growth in
    these markets. The Company performs continuing credit
    evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and
    although the Company generally does not require collateral, the
    Company may require letters of credit from customers in certain
    circumstances. The Company provides reserves for estimated
    amounts of accounts receivable that may not be collected.

m.

Concentration
    of Other Risks

The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid
    technological change, competitive pricing pressures and cyclical
    market patterns. The Company’s financial results are
    affected by a wide variety of factors, including general
    economic conditions worldwide, economic conditions specific to
    the semiconductor industry, the timely implementation of new
    manufacturing technologies, the ability to safeguard patents and
    intellectual property in a rapidly evolving market and reliance
    on assembly and test subcontractors, third-party wafer
    fabricators and independent distributors. In addition, the
    semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject
    to significant economic downturns at various times. The Company
    is exposed to the risk of obsolescence of its inventory
    depending on the mix of future business. Additionally, a large
    portion of the Company’s purchases of external wafer and
    foundry services are from a limited number of suppliers,
    primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing



ANALOG
    DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Company (TSMC). If TSMC or any of the Company’s other key
    suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver
    sufficient quantities of components, on the time schedule and of
    the quality that the Company requires, the Company may be forced
    to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could
    result in significant expenses and disruptions or delays in
    manufacturing, product development and shipment of product to
    the Company’s customers. Although the Company has
    experienced shortages of components, materials and external
    foundry services from time to time, these items have generally
    been available to the Company as needed.

n.

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue from product sales to customers is generally recognized
    when title passes, which for shipments to certain foreign
    countries is subsequent to product shipment. Title for these
    shipments ordinarily passes within a week of shipment. A reserve
    for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based
    on historical experience or specific identification of an event
    necessitating a reserve.

In all regions of the world, the Company defers revenue and the
    related cost of sales on shipments to distributors until the
    distributors resell the products to their customers. Therefore,
    the Company’s revenue fully reflects end customer purchases
    and is not impacted by distributor inventory levels. Sales to
    distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors
    to receive price adjustment credits, as discussed below, and to
    return qualifying products for credit, as determined by the
    Company, in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving,
    discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. These
    agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of the
    value of the Company’s shipments to that distributor during
    the prior quarter. In addition, distributors are allowed to
    return unsold products if the Company terminates the
    relationship with the distributor.

Distributors are granted price-adjustment credits related to
    many of their sales to their customers. Price adjustment credits
    are granted when the distributor’s standard cost (i.e., the
    Company’s sales price to the distributor) does not provide
    the distributor with an appropriate margin on its sales to its
    customers. As distributors negotiate selling prices with their
    customers, the final sales price agreed to with the customer
    will be influenced by many factors, including the particular
    product being sold, the quantity ordered, the particular
    customer, the geographic location of the distributor and the
    competitive landscape. As a result, the distributor may request
    and receive a price adjustment credit from the Company to allow
    the distributor to earn an appropriate margin on the transaction.

Distributors are also granted price adjustment credits in the
    event of a price decrease subsequent to the date the product was
    shipped and billed to the distributor. Generally, the Company
    will provide a credit equal to the difference between the price
    paid by the distributor (less any prior credits on such
    products) and the new price for the product multiplied by the
    quantity of such product in the distributor’s inventory at
    the time of the price decrease.

Given the uncertainties associated with the levels of price
    adjustment credits to be granted to distributors, the sales
    price to the distributor is not fixed or determinable until the
    distributor resells the products to their customers. Therefore,
    the Company defers revenue recognition from sales to
    distributors until the distributors have sold the products to
    their customers.

Title to the inventory transfers to the distributor at the time
    of shipment or delivery to the distributor, and payment from the
    distributor is due in accordance with the Company’s
    standard payment terms. These payment terms are not contingent
    upon the distributors’ sale of the products to their
    customers. Upon title transfer to distributors, inventory is
    reduced for the cost of goods shipped, the margin (sales less
    cost of sales) is recorded as “deferred income on shipments
    to distributors, net” and an account receivable is recorded.

The deferred costs of sales to distributors have historically
    had very little risk of impairment due to the margins the
    Company earns on sales of its products and the relatively long
    life-cycle of the Company’s products. Product returns from
    distributors that are ultimately scrapped have historically been
    immaterial. In addition, price protection and price adjustment
    credits granted to distributors historically have not exceeded
    the margins the Company earns on sales of its products. The
    Company continuously monitors the level and nature of product
    returns and is in continuous contact with the distributors to
    ensure reserves are established for all known material issues.

    sales of $84.4 million and $81.5 million,
    respectively. Deferred income on shipments to distributors
    increased by $93.5 million in fiscal 2010 primarily, as a
    result of the Company’s shipments to its distributors in
    fiscal 2010 exceeding the distributors’ sales to their
    customers during this same time period.

Shipping costs are charged to cost of sales as incurred.

The Company generally offers a

q.

Income
    Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
    differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets
    and liabilities and are measured using the enacted income tax
    rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the
    temporary differences are expected to reverse. Additionally,
    deferred tax assets and liabilities are separated into current
    and non-current amounts based on the classification of the
    related assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes.

r.

Earnings
    Per Share of Common Stock

Basic earnings per share is computed based only on the weighted
    average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
    Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted
    average number of common shares outstanding during the period,
    plus the dilutive effect of potential future issuances of common
    stock

relating to stock option programs and other potentially dilutive
    securities using the treasury stock method. In calculating
    diluted earnings per share, the dilutive effect of stock options
    is computed using the average market price for the respective
    period. In addition, the assumed proceeds under the treasury
    stock method include the average unrecognized compensation
    expense of stock options that are

in-the-money.

This results in the “assumed” buyback of additional
    shares, thereby reducing the dilutive impact of stock options.
    Potential shares related to certain of the Company’s
    outstanding stock options were excluded because they were
    anti-dilutive. Those potential shares, determined based on the
    weighted average exercise prices during the respective years,
    related to the Company’s outstanding stock options could be
    dilutive in the future.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on
    the grant-date fair value of the awards ultimately expected to
    vest, and is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis
    over the vesting period, which is generally five years.
    Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be
    recorded requires the Company to develop estimates used in
    calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options. The
    Company calculates the grant-date fair value using the
    Black-Scholes valuation model. The use of valuation models

Revenue
    Arrangements That Include Software Elements

In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)

No. 2009-14 —

Software (Topic 985): Certain Revenue Arrangements That
    Include Software Elements

(formerly EITF Issue

No. 09-3).

This standard removes tangible products from the scope of
    software revenue recognition guidance and also provides guidance
    on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement
    that includes a tangible product are within the scope of the
    software revenue guidance. More specifically, if the software
    sold with or embedded within the tangible product is essential
    to the functionality of the tangible product, then this
    software, as well as undelivered software elements that relate
    to this software, are excluded from the scope of existing
    software revenue guidance. ASU

No. 2009-14

is effective for fiscal years that begin on or after
    June 15, 2010, which is the Company’s fiscal year
    2011. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any,
    that ASU

No. 2009-14

may have on the Company’s financial condition and results
    of operations.

Multiple-Deliverable
    Revenue Arrangements

In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2009-13 —

Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue
    Arrangements

(formerly EITF Issue

No. 08-1).

This standard modifies the revenue recognition guidance for
    arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple elements,
    such as product, software, services or support, to a customer at
    different times as part of a single revenue generating
    transaction. This standard provides principles and application
    guidance to determine whether multiple deliverables exist, how
    the individual deliverables should be separated and how to
    allocate the revenue in the arrangement among those separate
    deliverables. The standard also expands the disclosure
    requirements for multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. ASU

Consolidations (Topic 810): Improvements to Financial
    Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest
    Entities

, which amends ASC 810,

Consolidation

.
    This standard requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to
    determine whether the enterprise’s variable interest or
    interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable
    interest entity. Additionally, an enterprise is required to
    assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to
    ensure that a variable interest entity operates as designed when
    determining whether it has the power to direct the activities of
    the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the
    entity’s economic performance. ASU

In November 2007, the Company entered into a purchase and sale
    agreement with certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor
    Corporation to sell the Company’s CPU voltage regulation
    and PC thermal monitoring business

which consisted of core voltage regulator products for the
    central processing unit in computing and gaming applications and
    temperature sensors and fan-speed controllers for managing the
    temperature of the central processing unit. During the first
    quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company completed the sale of this
    business for net cash proceeds of $138 million, which was
    net of other cash payments of approximately $1.4 million.
    The Company made final additional cash payments of approximately
    $2.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. In
    connection with the purchase and sale agreement,
    $7.5 million was placed into escrow and was excluded from
    the gain calculations. The Company recorded a

pre-tax

gain
    in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 of $78 million, or
    $43 million net of tax, which was recorded as a gain on
    sale of discontinued operations. During the third quarter of
    fiscal 2008, additional proceeds were released from escrow and
    an additional pre-tax gain of $6.6 million, or
    $3.8 million net of tax, was recorded as a gain on sale of
    discontinued operations. Additionally, at the time of the sale,
    the Company entered into a one-year manufacturing supply
    agreement with a subsidiary of ON Semiconductor Corporation for
    an additional $37 million. The Company has allocated the
    proceeds from this arrangement based on the fair value of the
    two elements of this transaction: (i) the sale of a
    business and (ii) the obligation to manufacture product for
    a one-year period. As a result, $85 million was recorded as
    a liability related to the manufacturing supply agreement, all
    of which has been utilized. The liability was included in
    current liabilities of discontinued operations on the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The Company recorded
    the revenue associated with this manufacturing supply agreement
    in discontinued operations. In the first quarter of fiscal 2010,
    additional proceeds of $1 million were released from
    escrow, $0.6 million net of tax, and was recorded as
    additional gain from the sale of discontinued operations. The
    Company does not expect any additional proceeds from this sale.

In September 2007, the Company entered into a definitive
    agreement to sell its Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc.
    The decision to sell the Baseband Chipset Business was due to
    the Company’s decision to focus its resources in areas
    where its signal processing expertise can provide unique
    capabilities and earn superior returns. On January 11, 2008
    the Company completed the sale of its Baseband Chipset Business
    for net cash proceeds of $269 million. The cash proceeds
    received were net of a refundable withholding tax of
    $62 million. In connection with the purchase and sale
    agreement, $10 million was placed into escrow and was
    excluded from the gain calculations. The Company made additional
    cash payments of $7.8 million during fiscal 2008, primarily
    related to transaction fees and retention payments to employees
    that transferred to MediaTek Inc. The Company made additional
    cash payments of $1.7 million during fiscal 2009 related to
    retention payments for employees who transferred to MediaTek
    Inc. and for the reimbursement of intellectual property license
    fees incurred by MediaTek Inc. In the first quarter of fiscal
    2010, the Company received cash proceeds of $62 million as
    a result of the refund of the withholding tax and also recorded
    an additional gain on sale of $0.3 million, or
    $0.2 million net of tax, due to the settlement of certain
    items at less than the amounts accrued. The Company may receive
    additional proceeds of up to $10 million, currently held in
    escrow, upon the resolution of certain contingent items, which
    would be recorded as additional gain from the sale of
    discontinued operations.

The following amounts related to the CPU voltage regulation and
    PC thermal monitoring and baseband chipset businesses have been
    segregated from continuing operations and reported as
    discontinued operations. These amounts also include the revenue
    and costs of sales provided under a manufacturing supply
    agreement between the

Stock-Based
    Compensation and Shareholders’ Equity

Equity
    Compensation Plans

The Company grants, or has granted, stock options and other
    stock and stock-based awards under The 2006 Stock Incentive Plan
    (2006 Plan). The 2006 Plan was approved by the Company’s
    Board of Directors on January 23, 2006 and was approved by
    shareholders on March 14, 2006 and subsequently amended in
    March 2006, June 2009, September 2009 and December 2009. The
    2006 Plan provides for the grant of up to 15 million shares
    of the Company’s common stock, plus such number of
    additional shares that were subject to outstanding options under
    the Company’s previous plans that are not issued because
    the applicable option award subsequently terminates or expires
    without being exercised. The 2006 Plan provides for the grant of
    incentive stock options intended to qualify under
    Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
    amended, non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights,
    restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based
    awards. Employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisors
    of the Company and its subsidiaries are eligible to be granted
    awards under the 2006 Plan. No award may be made under the 2006
    Plan after March 13, 2016, but awards previously granted
    may extend beyond that date. The Company will not grant further
    options under any previous plans.

While the Company may grant to employees options that become
    exercisable at different times or within different periods, the
    Company has generally granted to employees options that vest
    over five years and become exercisable in annual installments of
    20% on each of the first, second, third, fourth and fifth
    anniversaries of the date of grant;


/


%

    on each of the third, fourth, and fifth anniversaries of the
    date of grant; or in annual installments of 25% on each of the
    second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of
    grant. The maximum contractual term of all options is ten years.

As of October 30, 2010 a total of 12,669,980 common shares
    were available for future grant and 57,013,585 common shares
    were reserved for issuance under the 2006 Plan.

Grant-Date
    Fair Value

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to
    calculate the grant-date fair value of stock option awards. The
    grant date fair value of restricted stock units represents the
    value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant,
    reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on
    the Company’s common stock prior to vesting.

Includes options granted under the stock option exchange program
    which is described below.

Expected volatility — The Company is responsible for
    estimating volatility and has considered a number of factors,
    including third-party estimates, when estimating volatility. The
    Company currently believes that the exclusive use of implied
    volatility results in the best estimate of the grant-date fair
    value of employee stock options because it reflects the
    market’s current expectations of future volatility. In
    evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied
    volatility, the Company concluded that: (1) options in the
    Company’s common stock are actively traded with sufficient
    volume on several exchanges; (2) the market prices of both
    the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a
    similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the
    grant date of the employee share options; (3) the traded
    options have exercise prices that are both

near-the-money

and close to the exercise price of the employee share options;
    and (4) the maturities of the traded options used to
    estimate volatility are at least one year.

Expected term — The Company uses historical employee
    exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected
    term assumption for the Black-Scholes grant-date valuation. The
    Company believes that this historical data is currently the best
    estimate of the expected term of a new option, and that
    generally its employees exhibit similar exercise behavior.

Risk-free interest rate — The yield on zero-coupon
    U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate
    with the expected term assumption is used as the risk-free
    interest rate.

Expected dividend yield — Expected dividend yield is
    calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by the
    Company’s Board of Directors for the current quarter and
    dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of
    grant. Until such time as the Company’s Board of Directors
    declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from
    the current quarter’s cash dividend, the current dividend
    will be used in deriving this assumption. Cash dividends are not
    paid on options, restricted stock or restricted stock units.

Stock-based
    Compensation Expense

The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized during
    a period is based on the value of the awards that are ultimately
    expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant
    and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual
    forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term
    “forfeitures” is distinct from
    “cancellations” or “expirations” and
    represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered
    stock-based award. Based on an analysis of its historical
    forfeitures, the Company has applied an annual forfeiture rate
    of 4.3% to all unvested stock-based awards as of
    October 30, 2010. The rate of 4.3% represents the portion
    that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting
    period. This analysis will be re-evaluated quarterly and the
    forfeiture rate will be



ANALOG
    DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized
    over the vesting period will only be for those options that vest.

Stock-option
    Exchange

During fiscal 2009, shareholders approved and the Company
    completed an employee stock option exchange program (Option
    Exchange). The Option Exchange provided eligible employees of
    the Company, except named executive officers and directors, the
    opportunity to exchange eligible stock option grants for a
    smaller number of new stock options with a lower exercise price,
    or in some instances cash, that had approximately the same fair
    value as the options surrendered.

On September 28, 2009 the Company granted stock options for
    approximately 15.2 million shares in the aggregate to
    approximately 3,100 employees who elected to participate in
    the Option Exchange. The new stock options issued were subject
    to a new vesting period and a new contractual term based on the
    grant date of the original options. In addition, the Company
    made cash payments of approximately $2.6 million to
    approximately 5,100 employees whose exchanged options would
    each have resulted in a new stock option for fewer than
    100 shares. As a result of the exchange, employees elected
    to surrender options for approximately 33.6 million
    options, which were cancelled upon the grant of the new options
    on September 28, 2009.

The exchange of options in this Option Exchange is treated as a
    modification of the existing stock options for accounting
    purposes. Accordingly, any unrecognized compensation expense
    from the surrendered stock options will be recognized over the
    original service period of the surrendered option. Because the
    exchange ratios were calculated to result in the fair value of
    surrendered eligible stock options that was approximately equal
    to the fair value of the new stock options replacing them, the
    amount of incremental expense was immaterial.

In addition to the vested options, the Company expects a portion

The total intrinsic value of options exercised (i.e. the
    difference between the market price at exercise and the price
    paid by the employee to exercise the options) during fiscal
    2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 was $29.6 million,
    $4.7 million and $121.7 million, respectively. The
    total amount of proceeds received by the Company from exercise

of these options during fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008
    was $240.4 million, $15.1 million and
    $100.6 million, respectively. The total grant-date fair
    value of stock options that vested during fiscal 2010, fiscal
    2009 and fiscal 2008 was approximately $67.2 million,
    $73.6 million and $77.6 million, respectively.

Proceeds from stock option exercises pursuant to employee stock
    plans in the Company’s statement of cash flows of
    $216.1 million, $12.4 million and $94.2 million
    for fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively, are
    net of the value of shares surrendered by employees in certain
    limited circumstances to satisfy the exercise price of options,
    and to satisfy employee tax obligations upon vesting of
    restricted stock or restricted stock units and in connection
    with the exercise of stock options granted to the Company’s
    employees under the Company’s equity compensation plans.
    The withholding amount is based on the Company’s minimum

    period of 1.4 years.

Common
    Stock Repurchase Program

The Company’s common stock repurchase program has been in
    place since August 2004. In the aggregate, the Board of
    Directors has authorized the Company to repurchase
    $4 billion of the Company’s common stock under the
    program. Under the program, the Company may repurchase
    outstanding shares of its common stock from time to time in the
    open market and through privately negotiated transactions.
    Unless terminated earlier by resolution of the Company’s
    Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when the
    Company has repurchased all shares authorized under the program.
    As of October 30, 2010, the Company had repurchased a total
    of approximately 116.0 million shares of its common stock
    for approximately $3,948.2 million under this program. An
    additional $51.8 million remains available for repurchase
    of shares under the current authorized program. The repurchased
    shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common
    stock. Any future common stock repurchases will be dependent
    upon several factors including the amount of cash available to
    the Company in the United States, and the Company’s
    financial performance, outlook and liquidity. The Company also
    from time to time repurchases shares in settlement of employee
    tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted
    stock or restricted stock units, or in certain limited
    circumstances to satisfy the exercise price of options granted
    to the Company’s employees under the Company’s equity
    compensation plans.

Preferred
    Stock

The Company has 471,934 authorized shares of $1.00 par
    value preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding.
    The Board of Directors is authorized to fix designations,
    relative rights, preferences and limitations on the preferred
    stock at the time of issuance.

Industry,
    Segment and Geographic Information

The Company operates and tracks its results in one reportable

    Company designs, develops, manufactures and markets a broad
    range of integrated circuits. The Chief Executive Officer has
    been identified as the Chief Operating Decision Maker.

Revenue
    Trends by End Market

The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using
    a variety of data points including the technical characteristics
    of the product, the “sold to” customer information,
    the “ship to” customer information and the end
    customer product or application into which the Company’s
    product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and
    tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of
    products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, the
    Company reclassifies revenue by end market for prior periods.
    Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the
    sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end
    market.

Revenue
    Trends by Product

The following table summarizes revenue by product categories.
    The categorization of the Company’s products into broad
    categories is based on the characteristics of the individual
    products, the specification of the products and in some cases
    the specific uses that certain products have within
    applications. The categorization of products into categories is
    therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over
    time. In instances where products move between product
    categories, the Company reclassifies the amounts in the product
    categories for all prior periods.

Closure
    of Wafer Fabrication Facility in Sunnyvale

The Company ceased production at its California wafer
    fabrication facility in November 2006. The Company paid the
    related lease obligation costs on a monthly basis over the
    remaining lease term, which expired in March 2010. A one-time
    settlement charge of $0.4 million was recorded in the first
    quarter of fiscal 2010 related to the termination of the lease.
    This action was completed during fiscal 2010.

Consolidation
    of a Wafer Fabrication Facility in Limerick

In fiscal 2007, the Company recorded a special charge of
    $13.7 million as a result of its decision to only use
    eight-inch technology at its wafer fabrication facility in
    Limerick. Certain manufacturing processes and products produced
    on the Limerick facility’s six-inch production line have
    transitioned to the Company’s existing eight-inch
    production line in Limerick while others have transitioned to
    external foundries. The charge was for severance and fringe
    benefit costs recorded in accordance with the Company’s
    ongoing benefit plan for 150 manufacturing employees associated
    with this action. The Company has terminated the employment of
    all employees associated with these programs and has paid out
    all amounts owed to employees as severance. During fiscal 2008,
    the Company recorded an additional charge of $1.5 million
    related to this action, of which $1.2 million was an



ANALOG
    DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

adjustment to the original estimate of the severance costs and
    $0.3 million was for

clean-up

and
    closure costs that were expensed as incurred. During fiscal
    2009, the Company recorded additional charges of
    $1.2 million for

clean-up

and
    closure costs that were expensed as incurred. The production in
    the six-inch wafer fabrication facility ceased during the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2009. This action was completed during fiscal
    2010.

Reduction
    of Operating Costs

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, in order to further
    reduce its operating cost structure, the Company recorded a
    special charge of $1.6 million for severance and fringe
    benefit costs recorded in accordance with its ongoing benefit
    plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 19
    engineering, and selling, marketing, general and administrative
    (SMG&A) employees.

During fiscal 2009, the Company recorded an additional charge of
    $30.3 million related to this cost reduction action.
    Approximately $2.1 million of this charge was for lease
    obligation costs for facilities that the Company ceased using
    during the first quarter of fiscal 2009; approximately
    $0.8 million was for the write-off of property, plant and
    equipment no longer used as a result of this action; and
    approximately $0.5 million was for contract termination
    costs and approximately $0.3 million was for

clean-up

and
    closure costs that were expensed as incurred. The remaining
    $26.6 million related to the severance and fringe benefit
    costs recorded in accordance with the Company’s ongoing
    benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for
    245 manufacturing employees and 302 engineering and SMG&A
    employees.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company recorded an
    additional charge of $11.4 million related to the further
    reduction of its operating cost structure. Approximately
    $10.9 million of this charge was for severance and fringe
    benefit costs recorded in accordance with the Company’s
    ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign
    locations for 149 engineering and SMG&A employees.
    Approximately $0.5 million of the charge relates to the
    Company’s decision to abandon efforts to develop a
    particular expertise in power management, resulting in the
    impairment of related intellectual property.

The Company terminated the employment of all employees
    associated with this action and is paying amounts owed to
    employees for severance as income continuance.

Closure
    of a Wafer Fabrication Facility in Cambridge

During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company recorded a
    special charge of $22.1 million as a result of its decision
    to consolidate its Cambridge, Massachusetts wafer fabrication
    facility into its existing Wilmington, Massachusetts facility.
    In connection with the anticipated closure of this facility, the
    Company evaluated the recoverability of the facility’s
    manufacturing assets and concluded that there was an impairment
    of approximately $12.9 million based on the revised period
    of intended use. The remaining $9.2 million was for
    severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in accordance with
    the Company’s ongoing benefit plan for 175 manufacturing
    employees and 9 SMG&A employees associated with this action.

The Company finished production in the Cambridge wafer
    fabrication facility and began

clean-up

activities during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. During the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company reversed
    approximately $1.8 million of its severance accrual. The
    accrual reversal was required because 51 employees either
    voluntarily left the Company or found alternative employment
    within the Company. In addition, the Company recorded a special
    charge of approximately $1.7 million for the impairment of
    manufacturing assets that were originally going to be moved to
    the Company’s other wafer fabrication facilities but are no
    longer needed at those facilities and therefore have no future
    use. The Company also recorded a special charge of
    $0.1 million for

clean-up

costs as the Company began its cleanup of the Cambridge wafer
    fabrication facility at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal
    2009. The Company terminated the employment of all employees
    associated with this charge and is paying amounts owed to
    employees for severance as income continuance.



ANALOG
    DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company recorded an
    additional charge of $4.7 million related to this cost
    reduction action. Approximately $3.4 million of the charge
    related to lease obligation costs for the Cambridge wafer
    fabrication facility, which the Company ceased using in the
    first quarter of fiscal 2010. The remaining $1.3 million of
    the charge related to

clean-up

and
    closure costs that were expensed as incurred.

6.

Acquisitions

In fiscal 2006, the Company acquired substantially all the
    outstanding stock of privately-held Integrant Technologies, Inc.
    (Integrant) of Seoul, Korea. The acquisition enabled the Company
    to enter the mobile TV market and strengthened its presence in
    the Asian region. The Company paid $8.4 million related to
    the purchase of shares from the founder of Integrant during the
    period from July 2007 through July 2009. The Company recorded
    these payments as additional goodwill.

In fiscal 2006, the Company acquired all the outstanding stock
    of privately-held AudioAsics A/S (AudioAsics) of Roskilde,
    Denmark. The acquisition of AudioAsics allows the Company to
    continue developing low-power audio solutions, while expanding
    its presence in the Nordic and Eastern European regions. The
    Company paid additional cash payments of $3.1 million
    during fiscal 2009 for the achievement of revenue-based
    milestones during the period from October 2006 through January
    2009, which were recorded as additional goodwill. In addition,
    the Company paid $3.2 million during fiscal 2009 based on
    the achievement of technological milestones during the period
    from October 2006 through January 2009, which were recorded as
    compensation expense in fiscal 2008. All revenue and
    technological milestones related to this acquisition have been
    met and no additional payments will be made.

The Company has not provided pro forma results of operations for
    Integrant and AudioAsics herein as they were not material to the
    Company on either an individual or an aggregate basis. The
    Company included the results of operations of each acquisition
    in its consolidated statement of income from the date of such
    acquisition.

13.

Retirement
    Plans

The Company and its subsidiaries have various savings and
    retirement plans covering substantially all employees. The
    Company maintains a defined contribution plan for the benefit of
    its eligible U.S. employees. This plan provides for Company
    contributions of up to 5% of each participant’s total
    eligible compensation. In addition, the Company contributes an
    amount equal to each participant’s pre-tax contribution, if
    any, up to a maximum of 3% of each participant’s total
    eligible compensation. The total expense related to the defined
    contribution plan for U.S. employees was $20.5 million
    in fiscal 2010, $21.5 million in fiscal 2009 and
    $22.6 million in fiscal 2008. The Company also has various
    defined benefit pension and other retirement plans for certain

non-U.S. employees

    practices. The total expense related to the various defined
    benefit pension and other retirement plans for certain

non-U.S. employees

was $11.7 million in fiscal 2010, $10.9 million in

Assumptions

The range of assumptions used for the

non-U.S. defined

benefit plans reflects the different economic environments
    within the various countries. The projected benefit obligation
    was determined using the following weighted-average assumptions:



Discount rate

5.33

%

6.32

%

Rate of increase in compensation levels

3.40

%

3.72

%

Net annual periodic pension cost was determined using the
    following weighted average assumptions:



Discount rate

6.32

%

6.60

%

Expected long-term return on plan assets

6.73

%

7.16

%

Rate of increase in compensation levels

3.72

%

3.87

%

The expected long-term rate of return on assets is a
    weighted-average of the long-term rates of return selected for
    the various countries where the Company has funded pension
    plans. The expected long-term rate of return on assets
    assumption is selected based on the facts and circumstances that
    exist as of the measurement date and the specific portfolio mix
    of plan assets. Management, in conjunction with its actuaries,
    reviewed anticipated future long-term performance of individual
    asset categories and considered the asset allocation strategy
    adopted by the Company and/ or the trustees of the plans. While
    the review considered recent fund performance and historical
    returns, the assumption is primarily a long-term prospective
    rate.

The Company’s investment strategy is based on an
    expectation that equity securities will outperform debt
    securities over the long term. Accordingly, in order to maximize
    the return on assets, a majority of assets are invested in
    equities. Investments within each asset class are diversified to
    reduce the impact of losses in single investments. The use of
    derivative instruments is permitted where appropriate and
    necessary to achieve overall investment policy objectives and
    asset class targets.

The Company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage
    targets and appropriate benchmarks for each significant asset
    class to obtain a prudent balance between return and risk. The
    interaction between plan assets and benefit obligations is
    periodically studied by the Company and its actuaries to assist
    in the establishment of strategic asset allocation targets.

of global business, there are many transactions and calculations
    where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these
    uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement
    arrangements among related entities. Although the Company
    believes its estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given
    that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be
    different than that which is reflected in the historical income
    tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a
    material impact on the Company’s income tax provision and
    operating results in the period in which such determination is
    made.

On November 4, 2007 (the first day of its 2008 fiscal
    year), the Company adopted new accounting principles on
    accounting for uncertain tax positions. These principles require
    companies to determine whether it is “more likely than
    not” that a tax position will be sustained upon examination
    by the appropriate taxing authorities before any benefit can be
    recorded in the financial statements. An uncertain income tax
    position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50%
    likelihood of being sustained. There were no changes to the
    Company’s liabilities for uncertain tax positions as a
    result of the adoption of these provisions. As of
    October 30, 2010 and October 31, 2009, the Company had
    a liability of $18.4 million and $18.2 million,
    respectively, for gross unrealized tax benefits, all of which,
    if settled in the Company’s favor, would lower the
    Company’s effective tax rate in the period recorded. In
    addition, as of October 30, 2010 and October 31, 2009,
    the Company had a liability of approximately $9.8 million
    and $8.0 million, respectively, for interest and penalties.
    The total liability as of October 30, 2010 and
    October 31, 2009 of $28.3 million and
    $26.2 million, respectively, for uncertain tax positions is
    classified as non-current, and is included in other non-current
    liabilities, because the Company believes that the ultimate
    payment or settlement of these liabilities will not occur within
    the next twelve months. Prior to the adoption of these
    provisions, these amounts were included in current income tax
    payable. The Company includes interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for taxes in the
    condensed consolidated statements of income, and as a result, no
    change in classification was made upon adopting these
    provisions. The condensed consolidated statements of income for
    fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 include $1.8 million,
    $1.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively, of
    interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions.
    Due to the complexity associated with its tax uncertainties, the
    Company cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate as to the
    period in which it expects to settle the liabilities associated
    with these uncertain tax positions.

Fiscal
    Years 2004 and 2005 IRS Examination

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the IRS completed its
    field examination of the Company’s fiscal years 2004 and
    2005. On January 2, 2008, the IRS issued its report for
    fiscal 2004 and 2005, which included proposed adjustments
    related to these two fiscal years. The Company has recorded
    taxes and penalties related to certain of these proposed
    adjustments. There are four items with an additional potential
    total tax liability of $46 million. The Company has
    concluded, based on discussions with its tax advisors, that
    these four items are not likely to result in any additional tax
    liability. Therefore, the Company has not recorded any
    additional tax liability for these items and is appealing these
    proposed adjustments through the normal processes for the
    resolution of differences between the IRS and taxpayers. The
    Company’s initial meetings with the appellate division of
    the IRS were held during fiscal

year 2009. Two of the unresolved matters are one-time issues and
    pertain to Section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code related
    to the beneficial tax treatment of dividends from foreign owned
    companies under The American Jobs Creation Act. The other
    matters pertain to the computation of research and development
    (R&D) tax credits and the profits earned from manufacturing
    activities carried on outside the United States. These latter
    two matters could impact taxes payable for fiscal 2004 and 2005
    as well as for subsequent years.

Fiscal
    Years 2006 and 2007 IRS Examination

During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, the IRS completed its
    field examination of the Company’s fiscal years 2006 and
    2007. The IRS and the Company have agreed on the treatment of a
    number of issues that have been included in an Issue Resolutions
    Agreement related to the 2006 and 2007 tax returns. However, no
    agreement was reached on the tax treatment of a number of
    issues, including the same R&D credit and foreign
    manufacturing issues mentioned above related to fiscal 2004 and
    2005, the pricing of intercompany sales (transfer pricing) and
    the deductibility of certain stock option compensation expenses.
    During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, the IRS issued its
    report for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007, which included proposed
    adjustments related to these two fiscal years. The Company has
    recorded taxes and penalties related to certain of these
    proposed adjustments. There are four items with an additional
    potential total tax liability of $195 million. The Company
    concluded, based on discussions with its tax advisors, that
    these four items are not likely to result in any additional tax
    liability. Therefore, the Company has not recorded any
    additional tax liability for these items and is appealing these
    proposed adjustments through the normal processes for the
    resolution of differences between the IRS and taxpayers. The
    Company’s initial meetings with the appellate division of
    the IRS were held during fiscal year 2010. With the exception of
    the proposed adjustment related to the deductibility of certain
    stock option expenses, the other three matters could impact
    taxes payable for fiscal 2006 and 2007 as well as for subsequent
    years.

Fiscal
    Years 2008 and 2009 IRS Examination

The IRS has not started their examination of fiscal year 2008 or
    fiscal year 2009.

Although the Company believes its estimates of income tax
    payable are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the
    Company will prevail in the matters raised and that the outcome
    of one or all of these matters will not be different than that
    which is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and
    accruals. The Company believes such differences would not have a
    material impact on the Company’s financial condition but
    could have a material impact on the Company’s income tax
    provision, operating results and operating cash flows in the
    period in which such matters are resolved as well as for
    subsequent years.

Revolving
    Credit Facility

As of October 30, 2010, the Company had
    $2,687.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and
    short-term investments, of which $725.4 million was held in
    the United States. The balance of the Company’s cash and
    cash equivalents and short- term investments was held outside
    the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. As the
    Company intends to reinvest certain of its foreign earnings
    indefinitely, this cash is not available to meet certain of the
    Company’s cash requirements in the United States, including
    for cash dividends and common stock repurchases. The Company
    entered into a five-year, $165 million unsecured revolving
    credit facility with certain institutional lenders in May 2008.
    To date, the Company has not borrowed under this credit facility
    but the Company may borrow in the future and use the proceeds
    for support of commercial paper issuance, stock repurchases,
    dividend payments, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working
    capital and other lawful corporate purposes. Any advances under
    this credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are
    equal to LIBOR plus a margin that is based on the Company’s
    leverage ratio. The terms of this facility also include
    financial covenants that require the Company to maintain a
    minimum interest coverage ratio and not exceed a maximum
    leverage ratio. As of October 30, 2010, the Company was
    compliant with these covenants. The terms of the facility also
    impose restrictions on the Company’s ability to undertake
    certain transactions, to create certain liens on assets and to
    incur certain subsidiary indebtedness.

Long-Term
    Debt

On June 30, 2009, the Company issued $375 million
    aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notes
    due July 1, 2014 (the Notes) with semi-annual fixed
    interest payments on January 1 and July 1 of each year,
    commencing January 1, 2010. The sale of the Notes was made
    pursuant to the terms of an underwriting agreement dated
    June 25, 2009 between the Company and Credit Suisse
    Securities (USA) LLC, as representative of the several
    underwriters named therein. The net proceeds of the offering
    were $370.4 million, after issuing at a discount and
    deducting expenses, underwriting discounts and commissions,
    which will be amortized over the term of the Notes. The
    indenture governing the Notes contains covenants that may limit
    the Company’s ability to: incur, create, assume or
    guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a
    principal property; enter into sale and lease-back transactions
    with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or
    merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of its
    assets to, any other party.

On June 30, 2009, the Company entered into interest rate
    swap transactions where the Company swapped the notional amount
    of its $375 million of fixed rate debt at 5.0% into
    floating interest rate debt through July 1, 2014. Under the
    terms of the swaps, the Company will (i) receive on the
    $375 million notional amount a 5.0% annual interest payment
    that is paid in two installments on the 1st business day of
    every January and July, commencing January 1, 2010 through
    and ending on the maturity date; and (ii) pay on the
    $375 million notional amount an annual three-month LIBOR
    plus 2.05% (2.34% as of October 30, 2010) interest
    payment, payable in four installments on the 1st business
    day of every January, April, July and October, commencing on
    October 1, 2009 and ending on the maturity date. The LIBOR-
    based rate is set quarterly three months prior to the date of
    the interest payment. The Company designated these swaps as fair
    value hedges. The changes in the fair value of the interest rate
    swaps were reflected in the carrying value of the interest rate
    swaps in other assets on the balance sheet. The carrying value
    of the debt on the balance sheet was adjusted by an equal and
    offsetting amount.

    2010 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on
    December 3, 2010. In addition, on November 19, 2010
    the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the repurchase
    by the Company of an additional $1 billion of the
    Company’s common stock under the Company’s existing

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Analog Devices, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Analog Devices, Inc. as of October 30, 2010 and
    October 31, 2009, and the related consolidated statements
    of income, shareholders’ equity, comprehensive income, and
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    October 30, 2010. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(c). These
    financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Analog Devices, Inc. at October 30,
    2010 and October 31, 2009, and the consolidated results of
    its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended October 30, 2010, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
    information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Analog Devices, Inc.’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of October 30, 2010, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated November 22, 2010 expressed
    an unqualified opinion thereon.

    FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

Not applicable.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

(a)

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
    Procedures.

Our management, with the
    participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of Analog’s disclosure
    controls and procedures as of October 30, 2010. The term
    “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures
    of a company that are designed to ensure that information
    required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it
    files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
    the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
    procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
    designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
    a company in the reports that it files or submits under the
    Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
    company’s management, including its principal executive and
    principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely
    decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes
    that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
    and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
    their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment
    in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
    and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures as of October 30, 2010, our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as
    of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were
    effective at the reasonable assurance level.

(b)

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal
    control over financial reporting is defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

or

15d-15(f)

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers and effected by the company’s board of directors,
    management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
    regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
    preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
    includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of the company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
    that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
    only in accordance with authorizations of management and
    directors of the company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
    are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting as of October 30, 2010. In
    making this assessment, the company’s management used the
    criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
    of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated
    Framework.

Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of
    October 30, 2010, our internal control over financial
    reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Our independent registered public accounting firm that audited
    the financial statements included in this annual report has
    issued an attestation report on our internal control over
    financial reporting. This report appears below.

Attestation Report of the Registered Public
    Accounting Firm



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Analog Devices, Inc.

We have audited Analog Devices, Inc.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of October 30, 2010, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Analog Devices,
    Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Analog Devices, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of October 30, 2010, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Analog Devices, Inc. as of
    October 30, 2010 and October 31, 2009, and the related
    consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity,
    comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years
    in the period ended October 30, 2010 of Analog Devices,
    Inc. and our report dated November 22, 2010 expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.
