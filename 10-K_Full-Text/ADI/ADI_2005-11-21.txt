BUSINESS

Company Overview

We are a world leader in the design, manufacture and marketing
of high-performance analog, mixed-signal and digital signal
processing integrated circuits used in signal processing for
industrial, communication, computer and consumer applications.
Since our inception in 1965, we have focused on solving the
engineering challenges associated with signal processing in
electronic equipment. Real world signal processing describes the
process of converting real-world phenomena such as temperature,
motion, pressure, light and sound into electrical signals to be
used in a wide array of electronic equipment ranging from
industrial process control, factory automation systems
equipment, defense electronics, cellular communications, base
stations, central office equipment, wireless telephones,
computers, automobiles, CAT scanners, digital cameras and DVD
players. Signal processing is the cornerstone of high-speed
communications, digital entertainment, and other consumer,
computer and industrial applications. As new generations of
digital applications evolve, they generate new needs for
high-performance analog signal processing and digital signal
processing, or DSP, technology. We produce a wide range of
products that are designed to meet the signal processing
technology needs of a broad base of customers.

During fiscal 2005, approximately 39% of our revenue came from
the industrial market, which includes factory automation,
medical equipment, scientific instrumentation, automatic test
equipment, automotive electronics, security equipment and
aerospace and defense systems.

Revenues from the communications market represented
approximately 31% of our fiscal 2005 revenue. Communications
applications include wireless handsets and base stations, as
well as products used for high-speed access to the Internet,
including broadband modems and central office networking
equipment.

We also serve the personal computer market with products that
monitor and manage power usage, process signals used in flat
panel displays and multimedia projectors, and enable CD-quality
audio. In fiscal 2005, the computer market accounted for
approximately 15% of our revenue.

The demand for our products used in high-performance consumer
electronics has been increasing and represents approximately 15%
of our revenue for fiscal 2005. Applications in this market
include digital cameras and camcorders, DVD players, advanced
digital televisions and surround sound audio systems.

We sell our products worldwide through a direct sales force,
third-party distributors and independent sales representatives.
We have direct sales offices in 20 countries, including the
United States.

We are headquartered near Boston, in Norwood, Massachusetts, and
have manufacturing facilities in Massachusetts, California,
North Carolina, Ireland and the Philippines. We were founded in
1965 and are incorporated in Massachusetts. As of
October 29, 2005, we employed approximately 8,800
individuals worldwide. Our common stock is listed on the New
York Stock Exchange under the symbol ADI and is included in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.

We maintain a website with the address www.analog.com. We are
not including the information contained on our website as a part
of, or incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. We make available free of charge through our
website our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports

Industry Background

All electronic signals fall into one of two categories, analog
or digital. Analog, also known as linear, signals represent
real-world phenomena, such as temperature, pressure, sound,
speed and motion. This information can be detected and measured
using analog sensors, which represent real-world phenomena by
generating continuously-varying voltages and currents. The
signals from these sensors are initially processed using analog
methods, such as amplification, filtering and shaping. They are
then usually converted to digital form for storage or further
manipulation. The further manipulation of the signals after
conversion to digital form is called “digital signal
processing.” Digital signals represent the “ones”
and “zeros” of binary arithmetic and are either on or
off. Digital signals are frequently converted back to analog
form for functions such as video display, audio output or
control. These manipulations and transformations from analog to
digital and back to analog are known as “real-world signal
processing” within the signal chain.

Significant advances in semiconductor technology in recent years
have substantially increased the performance and functionality
of integrated circuits, or ICs, used in signal processing
applications. These advances include the ability to combine
analog and digital signal processing capability on a single
chip, thereby making possible more highly-integrated solutions.
The widespread application of low-cost, high-performance
microprocessor-based systems and of digital communication
technologies has increased the need for precise, high-speed
signal conditioning interfaces between the analog and digital
world. At the same time, the convergence of computing and
communications has resulted in end products that incorporate
state-of-the-art signal processing capability onto as few chips
as possible. Our products are designed to be used within
electronic equipment to achieve higher performance, including
greater speed, improved accuracy, more efficient signal
processing and minimized power consumption.

Principal Products

We design, manufacture and market a broad line of
high-performance ICs that incorporate analog, mixed-signal and
digital signal processing technologies. Our ICs are designed to
address a wide range of real-world signal processing
applications. Across the entire range of our signal processing
ICs are both general-purpose standard products used by a broad
range of customers and applications as well as
application-specific products designed for specific clusters of
customers in key target markets. By using readily available,
high-performance, general-purpose products in their systems, our
customers can reduce the time they need to bring new products to
market. Given the high cost of developing customized ICs, our
standard products often provide the most cost-effective solution
for many low to medium volume applications. In some
communications, computer and consumer products, we focus on
working with leading customers to design application-specific
solutions. We begin with our existing core technologies in
analog and DSP, and devise a solution to more closely meet the
needs of a specific customer or group of customers. Because we
have already developed the core technology for our
general-purpose products, we can create application-specific
solutions quickly.

We produce and market several thousand products. Our ten highest
revenue products accounted for approximately 12% of our revenue
for fiscal 2005. The majority of our products are proprietary,
meaning equivalent products are not available from competitors.
A limited number of other companies may provide products with
similar functions.

Analog Products

Our analog IC technology has been the foundation of our business
for four decades, and we believe we are one of the world’s
largest suppliers of analog ICs. Our analog ICs are primarily
high-performance devices, generally defined as devices that
support a minimum of 10-bits of accuracy and a minimum of 50
megahertz of speed. The principal advantages these products have
versus competitors’ products include higher accuracy, lower
cost per function, smaller size, lower power consumption and
fewer components for improved reliability. The majority of our
analog IC product revenue is attributable to sales of data
converters and amplifiers. The data converter and amplifier
product categories represented approximately 62% of our fiscal
2005 revenue. Other analog IC products include analog signal
processing devices such as analog multipliers, switches,
multiplexers and comparators. Over the past several years we
have been expanding our analog IC product



offerings along the entire analog signal chain and into product
areas such as radio frequency integrated circuits, or RF ICs,
and power management products such as voltage regulators and
thermal monitoring ICs, phase locked loops and high-speed clock
ICs.

The majority of our analog IC products are proprietary to us in
their design and general purpose in their application. This
allows customers to incorporate our products into a wide variety
of electronic equipment and systems. Our product portfolio
includes several thousand analog ICs, any one of which can have
as many as several hundred customers. Our analog ICs typically
have long product life cycles. Our analog IC customers include
both original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and customers
who build electronic subsystems for integration into larger
systems.

Our analog technology base also includes products using an
advanced IC technology known in the industry as surface
micromachining, which is used to produce semiconductor products
known as micro-electromechanical systems, or MEMS. This
technology enables extremely small mechanical sensors to be
built on the surface of a chip along with supporting circuitry.
In addition to incorporating an electro-mechanical structure,
these devices also have analog circuitry for conditioning
signals obtained from the sensing element. The integration of
signal conditioning and MEMS is a unique feature of our products
which we call iMEMS®. Our iMEMS product portfolio includes
accelerometers used to sense acceleration, and gyroscopes used
to sense position. The majority of our current revenue from
micromachined products is derived from accelerometers used by
automotive manufacturers in airbag applications. However,
revenue from consumer and industrial customers is increasing as
we develop products using this technology for applications in
these end markets.

DSP Products

DSPs are processors that are optimized for high-speed numeric
calculations, which are essential for real-time processing of
digital data resulting, in most cases, from analog to digital
signal conversion. Our DSP products are designed to be fully
programmable and to efficiently execute specialized software
programs, or algorithms, associated with processing digitized
real-time, real-world data. Programmable DSPs provide the
flexibility to modify the device’s function quickly and
inexpensively in software. We offer both general-purpose and
application-specific DSP products. General-purpose DSP IC
customers typically write their own algorithms using software
tools that we provide and software tools they obtain from
third-party suppliers. Our application-specific DSP products
typically include analog and DSP technology and the DSPs are
preprogrammed to execute software for applications such as
wireless telecommunications or image processing. Our DSPs are
designed in families of products that share a common
architecture and therefore can execute the same software. We
support these products with easy-to-use, low-cost development
tools, which reduce our customers’ product development
costs and time-to-market.

Increasingly, many of our products combine analog and digital
signal processing technology into multi-function mixed-signal
devices and chipsets. The growing technological demands
associated with the use of audio and video in computers and
consumer products as well as the networking of communications
systems has created new opportunities for these mixed-signal
products. Examples of these products include chipsets for
communication applications such as global system for mobile
cellular phones, or GSM, cable modems, and broadband modems.
Other examples include audio input/output devices for computer
applications and data acquisition devices for industrial
instrumentation.

Markets and Applications

The following describes some of the characteristics of, and
customer products within, our major markets:

Industrial

— Our industrial market
includes the following areas:

Industrial Process Automation

— Our industrial
process automation market includes applications such as factory
automation systems, automatic process control systems, robotics,
environmental control systems and automatic test equipment.
These products generally require ICs that offer performance
greater than that available from commodity-level ICs, but
generally do not have production volumes that warrant custom or



application-specific ICs. Combinations of analog, mixed-signal
and DSP ICs are usually employed to achieve the necessary
functionality. Automatic test equipment applications have
created opportunities for the design of system-level ICs that
require a high level of electronic circuitry.

Instrumentation

— Our instrumentation market
includes engineering, medical and scientific instruments. These
products are usually designed using the highest performance
analog and mixed-signal ICs available. Customer products include
oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, CAT scanners, MRI equipment,
blood analyzers and microscopes.

Defense/ Aerospace

— The defense, commercial
avionics and space markets all require high-performance ICs that
meet rigorous environmental and reliability specifications. Many
of our analog ICs can be supplied in versions that meet these
standards. In addition, many products can be supplied to meet
the standards required for broadcast satellites and other
commercial space applications. Most of our products sold in this
market are specifically-tested versions of products derived from
our standard product offering. Customer products include
navigation systems, flight simulators, radar systems and
security devices.

Automotive

— Although the automotive market has
historically been served with low-cost, low-performance ICs,
demand has emerged for higher performance devices for a wide
range of safety and entertainment applications. In response, we
are developing products specifically for the automotive market.
We supply a micromachined IC used as a crash sensor in airbag
systems, roll-over sensing, global positioning satellite, or
GPS, automotive navigation systems, anti-lock brakes and
“smart” suspension systems. In addition, our analog
and DSP ICs have application in engine control, in-cabin
electronics, and collision avoidance systems.

Communications

— The development of
broadband, wireless and Internet infrastructures around the
world has created an important market for our communications
products. Communications technology involves the acquisition of
analog signals that are converted from analog to digital and
digital to analog form during the process of transmitting and
receiving data. The need for higher speed and reduced power
consumption, coupled with more reliable, bandwidth-efficient
communications, has been creating demand for our products. Our
products are used in the full spectrum of signal processing for
audio, data, image and video communication. In wireless and
broadband communication applications, our products are
incorporated into cellular telephones, cellular base station
equipment, modems, pagers, PBX switches, routers and remote
access servers.

Computers and Computer Peripherals

—
Image and sound-enabled applications used in computer gaming and
web sites and the increasing need for power and thermal
management capability in PCs have provided opportunities in the
computer market. The computer industry seeks to develop and
market ever smaller and lighter personal computers. This need
has increased demand for high-performance ICs that monitor power
usage, enabling manufacturers to use smaller batteries and
extend battery life between charges. In addition, we currently
supply a variety of ICs used in this market for enhanced audio
input and output capability for business and entertainment
applications.

Consumer Electronics

— Increased market
demand for digital entertainment systems for acquisition,
display and digital processing of signals has allowed us to
combine analog and digital design capability to provide
solutions that are designed to meet the rigorous cost, size and
reliability constraints of the consumer electronics market. The
emergence of high-performance, feature-rich consumer products,
such as digital camcorders and cameras, home theater systems,
advanced digital televisions, video projectors and DVD
recorders/players, has led to the need for high-performance,
system-level ICs with a high level of specific functionality.

Research and Development

Our markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and
advances. Accordingly, we make substantial investments in the
design and development of new products and manufacturing
processes, and the improvement of existing products and
manufacturing processes. We spent approximately
$497 million during fiscal 2005 on the design, development
and improvement of new and existing products and manufacturing



processes, compared to approximately $514 million during
fiscal 2004 and approximately $453 million during fiscal
2003.

Our research and development strategy focuses on building
technical leadership in core technologies for signal sensing,
conditioning, conversion and processing. In support of our
research and development activities, we employ thousands of
engineers involved in product and manufacturing process
development at over 30 design centers and manufacturing sites
located throughout the world.

Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights

As of October 29, 2005, we held 1,081 United States patents
and had 567 patent applications pending with the United States
Patent and Trademark Office with expiration dates ranging from
2005 through 2024. We believe that while our patents may provide
some advantage, our competitive position is largely determined
by such factors as the system and application knowledge, ability
and experience of our personnel, the range and success of new
products being developed by us, our market brand recognition and
ongoing marketing efforts, customer service and technical
support. It is generally our policy to seek patent protection
for significant inventions that may be patented, though we may
elect, in certain cases, not to seek patent protection even for
significant inventions, if other protection, such as maintaining
the invention as a trade secret, is considered more
advantageous. We also have trademarks that are used in the
conduct of our business to distinguish genuine Analog
Devices’ products and we maintain cooperative advertising
programs to promote our brands and identify products containing
genuine Analog Devices’ components. In addition, we have
registered certain of our mask sets under the Semiconductor Chip
Protection Act of 1984.

There can be no assurance that any patent will issue on pending
applications or that any patent issued will provide substantive
protection for the technology or product covered by it. There
also can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent
similar technology or reverse engineer our products or that our
confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, silicon
foundries and other suppliers and vendors will be adequate to
protect our interests. Moreover, the laws of countries in which
we design, manufacture and market our products may afford little
or no effective protection of our proprietary technology.

The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims
and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property
rights, including claims arising under our contractual
indemnification of our customers. We have received from time to
time, and may receive in the future, claims from third parties
asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents
or other intellectual property rights. In the event a third
party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a
license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms,
or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop
production of products incorporating that intellectual property,
and our operating results could be materially and adversely
affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or
other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us
against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be
costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. See
Note 11 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial
Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K for information concerning pending litigation
that involves us. An adverse outcome in this or other litigation
could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial position or on our consolidated results of operations
or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved.

Sales Channels

We sell our products in North America and internationally
through a direct sales force, third-party distributors, and
independent sales representatives and via our worldwide website
on the Internet.

Approximately 19% of our fiscal 2005 net sales were to
customers in Japan. Approximately 11% of our fiscal
2005 net sales were to customers in China and approximately
22% were to customers elsewhere in Asia, principally Taiwan and
Korea. As of October 29, 2005, we had direct sales offices
in the Asia region in China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea,
Singapore and Taiwan.

Approximately 25% of our fiscal 2005 net sales were to
customers in North America. As of October 29, 2005, we had
11 direct sales offices in the United States.



Approximately 23% of our fiscal 2005 net sales were to
customers in Europe. As of October 29, 2005, we had direct
sales offices in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United
Kingdom.

We also had sales representatives and/or distributors in over 45
countries outside North America, including countries where we
also have direct sales offices. For further detail regarding
revenues and financial information about geographic areas, see
our Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 3 in the
related Notes contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Approximately 49% of our fiscal 2005 revenue was derived from
sales made through distributors. Revenue is deferred on sales
made through distributors until the distributors resell the
products to the end users, known as “sell out” or
“sell through” in the industry. These distributors
typically maintain an inventory of our products. Some of them
also sell products competitive with our products, including
those for which we are an alternate source. Sales to certain
distributors are made under agreements that provide protection
to the distributors for their inventory of our products against
price reductions and products that are slow-moving or that we
have discontinued, including limited product return privileges.

Our worldwide technical direct field sales efforts are supported
by an extensive promotional program that includes editorial
coverage and paid advertising in trade publications, direct mail
programs, promotional brochures, technical seminars and
participation in trade shows. We publish and distribute
full-length databooks, product catalogs, applications guides,
technical handbooks and detailed data sheets for individual
products. We also provide product and application information
and sell products via our worldwide website on the Internet. We
maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid
customers in incorporating our products into their products.

We have tens of thousands of customers worldwide. Our largest
single customer, excluding distributors, represented
approximately 4% of our fiscal 2005 net sales, and our 20
largest customers, excluding distributors, accounted for
approximately 29% of our fiscal 2005 net sales.

Foreign Operations

Through subsidiaries and affiliates, we conduct business in
numerous countries outside the United States. During fiscal
2005, approximately 75% of our revenue was derived from
customers in international markets. Our international business
is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign
operations, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates and controls, import and export controls, and other laws,
policies and regulations of foreign governments.

We have manufacturing facilities outside the United States in
Ireland and the Philippines. In addition to being exposed to the
ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry, we are
also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in
international operations and their impact on the United States
economy in general, including the risks associated with ongoing
uncertainties and political and economic instability in many
countries around the world as well as the economic disruption
from acts of terrorism, and the response to them by the United
States and its allies. These risks include air transportation
disruptions, expropriation, currency controls, currency exchange
rate movement, and additional costs related to tax, tariff and
freight rates. Although we engage in hedging transactions to
reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations,
there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not
be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the
United States dollar against other currencies.

Production and Raw Materials

Monolithic integrated circuit components are manufactured in a
sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer
fabrication, wafer testing, cutting the wafer into individual
“chips,” or dice, assembly of the dice into packages
and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form.
The raw materials used to manufacture these devices include
silicon wafers, processing chemicals (including liquefied
gases), precious metals, ceramic and plastic used for packaging.



We develop and employ a wide variety of proprietary
manufacturing processes that are specifically tailored for use
in fabricating high-performance linear, mixed-signal and MEMS
ICs. We also use bipolar and CMOS wafer fabrication processes.

Our IC products are fabricated both at our production facilities
and by third-party wafer fabricators. Most of our analog
products are manufactured in our own wafer fabrication
facilities using proprietary processes. Our DSP products, and a
portion of our analog products, are manufactured at third-party
wafer-fabrication foundries using sub-micron digital CMOS
processes. We operate wafer fabrication facilities in Wilmington
and Cambridge, Massachusetts; Sunnyvale, California and
Limerick, Ireland. We also operate assembly and test facilities
located in the Philippines and use third-party subcontractors.

Capital spending in fiscal 2005 was $85 million, compared
with $146 million in fiscal 2004. We currently plan to make
capital expenditures of approximately $126 million in
fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2006, we plan to close our Sunnyvale
wafer fabrication facility and transfer production of products
currently manufactured there to our facilities in Wilmington,
Massachusetts and Limerick, Ireland, as well as to third-party
wafer fabricators. We believe when these actions are complete,
we will have ample installed capacity to significantly increase
internal production levels with modest additional capital
expenditures.

Our products require a wide variety of components and raw
materials, most of which we purchase from third-party suppliers.
We have multiple sources for many of the components and
materials we purchase and incorporate into our products.
However, a large portion of our external wafer purchases are
from sole-source suppliers, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company (TSMC). If these sole-source suppliers are
unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient
quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the
quality that we require, we may be forced to engage additional
or replacement suppliers, which could result in additional
expenses and delays in product development or shipment of
product to our customers. Although we have experienced shortages
of components from time to time, these items have generally been
available to us as needed.

Backlog

Backlog at the end of fiscal 2005 was approximately
$356 million, up from approximately $329 million at
the end of fiscal 2004. We define backlog as of a particular
date as firm orders with a customer or distributor requested
delivery date within thirteen weeks. Backlog is impacted by the
tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available
from suppliers, including us, in periods of depressed demand. In
periods of increased demand, there is a tendency towards longer
lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and, in
some instances, we may not have manufacturing capacity
sufficient to fulfill all orders. As is customary in the
semiconductor industry, we allow most orders to be canceled or
deliveries delayed by customers without significant penalty.
Accordingly, we believe that our backlog at any time should not
be used as an indication of our future revenue.

Government Contracts

We estimate that approximately 3% of our fiscal 2005 revenue was
attributable to sales to the U.S. government and government
contractors and subcontractors. Our government contract business
is predominantly in the form of negotiated, firm fixed-price
subcontracts. All such contracts and subcontracts contain
standard provisions relating to termination at the election of
the United States government.

Competition

We compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets
that are highly competitive. We believe we are one of the
largest suppliers of high-performance analog and mixed-signal
processing components. Competitors for our analog and DSP
products include Broadcom Corporation, Cirrus Logic Inc.,
Infineon Technologies, Linear Technology Corporation, Maxim
Integrated Products, Inc., National Semiconductor Corporation,
Phillips Semiconductor, ST Microelectronics and Texas
Instruments, Inc. Sales of our micromachined products currently
consist of acceleration sensors and gyroscopes, and our main
competitors in



that market are Bosch, Denso Corporation, Freescale
Semiconductor, Inc., Panasonic, ST Microelectronics, Systron
Donner and VTI Technologies.

We believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for
real-world signal processing components depends upon several
factors, including technical innovation, product quality and
reliability, range of products, product price, customer service
and technical support. We believe our technical innovation
emphasizing product performance and reliability, supported by
our commitment to strong customer service and technical support,
enables us to compete in our chosen markets against both foreign
and domestic semiconductor manufacturers.

Many other companies offer products that compete with our
products, and some have greater financial, manufacturing,
technical and marketing resources than we have. Additionally,
some formerly-independent competitors have been purchased by
larger companies. Our competitors also include emerging
companies selling specialized products to markets we serve.
There can be no assurances that we will be able to compete
successfully in the future against existing or new competitors,
or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by
increased price competition.

Environment

Our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous
environmental laws and regulations, particularly with respect to
industrial waste and emissions. Compliance with these laws and
regulations has not had a material impact on our capital
expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

We are committed to protecting the environment and the health
and safety of our employees, customers and the public. We
endeavor to adhere to the most stringent standards across all of
our facilities, to encourage pollution prevention and to strive
towards continual improvement. We strive to exceed compliance
with regulatory standards in order to achieve a standard of
excellence in environmental, health and safety management
practices as an integral part of our total quality management
system.

On January 27, 2003, the European Union passed the
“Restriction on Use of Hazardous Substances in Electrical
and Electronic Equipment,” or “RoHS” directive
2002/95/ EC, which becomes applicable July 1, 2006. We are
in the process of transitioning the manufacturing process of
some of our products to eliminate the use of these hazardous
substances. The transition has been completed for over 5,500 of
our standard products, and we intend to continue the transition
to satisfy local regulatory requirements and the needs of our
customers. If we do not meet the European Union deadline on the
use of certain hazardous substances or the deadlines of other
countries which may enact such legislation, it would preclude us
from selling products containing these hazardous substances in
these affected locations. This could have a material adverse
impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
Additionally, once the deadline for the mandatory restrictions
on the use of certain hazardous materials has passed for the
European Union, we may still have in our inventory products
which contain these hazardous substances. Should we be unable to
sell these products to locations which do not have such
restrictions, we would have to write such inventory off as
obsolete. This could have a material adverse impact on our
results of operations and financial condition.

Employees

As of October 29, 2005, we employed approximately 8,800
individuals worldwide. Our future success depends in large part
on the continued service of our key technical and senior
management personnel, and on our ability to continue to attract,
retain and motivate qualified employees, particularly those
highly-skilled design, process, test and applications engineers
involved in the manufacture of existing products and the
development of new products and processes. We believe that
relations with our employees are good; however, the competition
for such personnel is intense, and the loss of key employees
could have a material adverse effect on us.

In addition to the principal leased properties listed in the
above table, we also lease sales offices and other premises at
23 locations in the United States and 33 locations overseas
under operating lease agreements. These leases expire at various
dates through the year 2015. We do not anticipate experiencing
significant difficulty in retaining occupancy of any of our
manufacturing, office or sales facilities through lease renewals
prior to expiration or through month-to-month occupancy, or in
replacing them with equivalent facilities. For information
concerning our obligations under all operating leases see

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Tentative Settlement of the SEC’s Previously Announced
Stock Option Investigation

In our Form 10-K filing dated November 30, 2004, we
disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) had initiated an inquiry into our stock option
granting practices, focusing on options that were granted
shortly before the issuance of favorable financial results. On
November 15, 2005, we announced that a tentative settlement
has been reached.

Since receiving notice of this inquiry, we have been cooperating
with the SEC and believe that the matter will be concluded in
the near future. We and our President and CEO, Mr. Jerald
G. Fishman, have made an offer of settlement to the Staff of the
SEC, which is subject to agreement regarding the specific
language of the SEC’s administrative order and other
settlement documents. The SEC Staff has decided to recommend the
offer of settlement to the Commission. A final settlement is
subject to review and approval by the Commission.

Our Board of Directors and Mr. Fishman believe that it is
in the best interests of our shareholders to settle this case on
the proposed terms rather than face a protracted dispute with
the SEC.

The contemplated settlement addresses two separate issues. The
first issue concerns our disclosure regarding grants of options
to our employees and directors prior to the release of favorable
financial results. Specifically, the issue relates to options
granted to our employees

(

including officers

)

on
November 30, 1999 and to employees

(

including
officers

)

and directors on November 10, 2000. The
SEC settlement would conclude that we should have made
disclosures in our proxy filings to the effect that we priced
these stock options prior to releasing favorable financial
results.

The second issue addressed by the tentative settlement concerns
the grant dates for options granted to our employees

(

including officers

)

in 1998 and 1999, and the
grant date for options granted to employees (including
officers

)

and directors in 2001. Specifically, the
settlement would conclude that the appropriate grant date for
the September 4, 1998 options should have been
September 8

th

(which
is one trading day later than the date that was used to price
the options); the appropriate grant date for the
November 30, 1999 options should have been
November 29

th

(which
is one trading day earlier than the date that was used); and the
appropriate grant date for the July 18, 2001 options should
have been
July 26

th

(which
is five trading days after the original date).

In connection with the contemplated settlement, we would consent
to a cease-and-desist order under Section 10(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, would
pay a civil money penalty of $3 million, and would reprice
options granted to Mr. Fishman and other directors in
certain years. Options granted to all other employees would be
excluded from the repricing. Mr. Fishman would consent to a
cease-and-desist order under Sections 17(a)(2) and
(3) of the Securities Act, would pay a civil money penalty
of $1 million, and would make a disgorgement payment with
respect to options granted in certain years. With the exception
of options granted in 1998, Mr. Fishman has not exercised
or sold any of the options identified in this matter. We and
Mr. Fishman would settle this matter without admitting or
denying the Commission’s findings.

We have determined that no restatement of our historical
financial results would be necessary due to the proposed
settlement, because the effects of using revised measurement
dates for options granted in 1998, 1999 and 2001 are not
material to any of the fiscal years 1998 through 2005, based on
the materiality guidelines contained in SAB 99. If a
stock-based compensation charge had been taken as a result of
the revised measurement dates for these option grants to all
employees (including officers) and directors, our net income for
fiscal years 1998 through 2005 would have been reduced by
$21.8 million in total. During this period, we earned
cumulative net income of over $2.5 billion. There would be
no impact on revenue, cash flow from operations, or
shareholders’ equity as a result of using the revised
measurement dates. The impact on net income in individual fiscal
years would have been as follows: fiscal 1998
($0.2 million), fiscal 1999 ($1.4 million), fiscal
2000 ($1.8 million), fiscal 2001 ($3.7 million),
fiscal 2002 ($8.1 million), fiscal 2003
($6.1 million), fiscal 2004 ($0.5 million).



Other Legal Proceedings

On June 14, 2005, Biax Corporation filed its first amended
complaint for patent infringement in the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Texas against us and Intel
Corporation, alleging that we infringed three patents owned by
Biax relating to parallel processors. On November 7, 2005,
Biax filed a second amended complaint alleging that we infringed
two additional patents. Prior to the filing of the first amended
complaint, we were unaware of Biax or this action. The first
amended complaint seeks injunctive relief, unspecified damages
with interest, as well as Biax’s costs, expenses and fees.
On August 3, 2005, we filed an answer and counterclaimed
against Biax. In the counterclaim, we seek rulings that the
patents are not infringed, the patents are invalid and the
patents are unenforceable. The case has not yet entered the
discovery phase. We intend to vigorously defend against these
allegations. We are unable at this time to predict the outcome
of this litigation.

On November 6, 2003, Enron Corporation commenced a
proceeding in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
Southern District of New York. On December 1, 2003, Enron
filed an amended complaint to add us as a defendant in such
proceeding. The amended complaint alleges that transfers made by
Enron in satisfaction of obligations it had under commercial
paper are recoverable as preferential transfers and fraudulent
transfers and are subject to avoidance under the United States
Bankruptcy Code. It is alleged that payments made in premature
satisfaction of obligations under commercial paper totaling
approximately $20 million are recoverable from
J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc., Fleet Capital Markets, Fleet
National Bank and/or us. We sold $20 million of Enron
commercial paper to Fleet and did not enter into any direct
transactions with Enron. We filed a motion to dismiss the
adversary proceeding. The motion to dismiss was denied by order
dated June 30, 2005. We intend to vigorously defend against
these claims. Although we believe we have meritorious defenses
to the asserted claims, we are unable at this time to predict
the outcome of this proceeding.

We are currently under routine audit by the United States
Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) for fiscal years
2001, 2002 and 2003. The audit has not been completed and the
IRS has not issued a report on its audit.

From time to time as a normal incidence of the nature of our
business, various claims, charges and litigation are asserted or
commenced against us arising from, or related to, contractual
matters, patents, trademarks, personal injury, environmental
matters, product liability, insurance coverage and personnel and
employment disputes. As to such claims and litigation we can
give no assurance that we will prevail.

We do not believe that any of the matters described above will
have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of
operations or financial position, although an adverse outcome of
any of these matters is possible and could have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash
flows in the quarter or annual period in which one or more of
these matters are resolved.

Revenue declined 9% in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004,
primarily as a result of an inventory correction at our
customers in the ATE, or automatic test equipment, and wireless
handset markets during the fiscal year. Gross margins declined
by 110 basis points primarily as a result of the effect of
fixed manufacturing costs allocated across lower levels of
production. We recorded special charges of $31 million in
accordance with our restructuring plan announced in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2005, of which $20 million related to
severance costs associated with the closure of our California
wafer fabrication facility and $11 million related to
severance costs associated with a reorganization of our product
development and support programs. During fiscal 2005, we
repatriated $1,055 million of accumulated foreign earnings.
Under current tax law, the earnings repatriated prior to
October 29, 2005 were taxed at a reduced effective tax
rate. As a result of this action, we recorded additional income
tax expenses of $49 million in fiscal 2005. We generated
cash flow from operations of $673 million during fiscal
2005, repurchased $525 million of our common stock and paid
$119 million in cash dividends. Our cash, cash equivalents
and short-term investments balance increased by $21 million
during fiscal 2005 to $2,706 million at October 29,
2005.

On October 18, 2005, we accelerated the vesting of all
unvested stock options granted after December 31, 2000
awarded to employees under our stock option plans that had
exercise prices of $40.00 or greater. The vesting terms of
options issued to corporate officers and directors were not
accelerated. Unvested options to purchase approximately
18 million shares became exercisable as a result of the
vesting acceleration. Because the exercise price of all the
modified options was greater than the market price of our
underlying common stock on the date of their modification, no
compensation expense was recorded in the statement of income in
accordance with APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees.

The primary purpose for modifying the terms of these options to
accelerate their vesting was to eliminate the need to recognize
the remaining unrecognized non-cash compensation expense in our
statement of income associated with these options as measured
under SFAS 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

,
which is a revision of SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation

, or SFAS 123(R). The
approximately $188 million ($134 million net of tax)
of future expense associated with these options would have been
disproportionately high compared to the economic value of the
options at the date of modification. We are required to adopt
SFAS 123(R) effective as of the beginning of the first
quarter of fiscal 2006 and we will be required to record
compensation expense associated with stock options in the
statement of income, rather than in a pro forma footnote to our
consolidated financial statements.

Revenue

Net sales declined $245 million, or 9%, in fiscal 2005
compared to fiscal 2004. This decline was primarily the result
of a 21% decrease in orders for products used in communications
applications due to weakness in the wireless handset end
markets. Sales to customers in the industrial market decreased
4% as a result of an inventory correction at our customers in
the automatic test equipment market in the first half of fiscal
2005. Sales to customers in the computer end market decreased
10% in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. These decreases
were partially offset by a 12% increase in sales to customers in
the consumer end market.



For fiscal 2004, net sales increased $587 million, or 29%,
from fiscal 2003. This increase in net sales in fiscal 2004 was
a result of what we believed was a broad-based increase in
demand for our products used in every end market we serve.
Increased demand for our products used in industrial products
and communications products accounted for approximately 80% of
this year-to-year increase, and increased demand for our
products used in consumer and computer end markets accounted for
the remaining increase in net sales. Increased demand for our
products used in wireless handsets and infrastructure was the
main reason for our increased sales in the communications end
market.

Over the last three fiscal years, net sales from analog products
were approximately 80% of net sales and sales of DSP products
represented approximately 20% of net sales. In fiscal 2005,
analog product sales decreased 7% and DSP product sales
decreased 18% from the levels recorded in fiscal 2004. In fiscal
2004, analog product sales increased 31% and DSP product sales
increased 21% from the levels recorded in fiscal 2003.

of sale, for the last three years is as follows:

The percentage of our net sales in China as a percentage of our

wireless handset end markets.

Gross margin declined in fiscal 2005 by 110 basis points

margin was primarily the result of the effect of fixed
manufacturing costs allocated across lower levels of production.

Gross margin improved in fiscal 2004 by 410 basis points
from the gross margin in fiscal 2003. The improvement in gross
margin for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily
the result of spreading fixed manufacturing costs over an
increasing sales level and, to a lesser extent, the impact of
restructuring actions taken in previous years as well as
continued tight cost control at our manufacturing operations.

R&D expenses for fiscal 2005 decreased by $17 million,
or 3%, from the amount recorded in fiscal 2004. This decrease
was caused by a $9 million reduction in employee bonus
expenses and reductions in other expenses of $21 million as
a result of our tight control over all other engineering
expenses throughout the year.



These expense reductions were partially offset by a
$13 million increase in salary and employee benefit
expenses.

R&D expenses increased by $62 million, or 14% in fiscal
2004 from the amount recorded in fiscal 2003. This increase was
primarily due to additional salary and benefit costs associated
with a 5% increase in engineering headcount during the year as
well as annual salary increases and increased bonus payments
and, to a lesser extent, an increase in other engineering
expenses reflecting the increased R&D activity during the
year.

R&D expense as a percentage of net sales will fluctuate from
year-to-year depending on the amount of net sales and the
success of new product development efforts, which we view as
critical to our future growth. At any point in time we have
hundreds of R&D projects underway, and we believe that none
of these projects is material on an individual basis. We expect
to continue the development of innovative technologies and
processes for new products, and we believe that a continued
commitment to R&D is essential in order to maintain product
leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative
new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to
make significant R&D investments in the future.

SMG&A expenses decreased in fiscal 2005 by $2 million
or 1% from the levels recorded in 2004. The decrease in
SMG&A expenses was caused by a reduction in employee bonus
expenses of $4 million and reductions in other SMG&A
expenses of $10 million as a result of tight control over
all discretionary spending throughout the year. These expense
reductions were partially offset by a $12 million increase
in salary and employee benefit costs.

SMG&A expenses increased in fiscal 2004 by $52 million,
or 18%, from the levels recorded in fiscal 2003. This increase
was primarily the result of increased salary and employee
benefit expenses, increased employee bonus expenses, increased
commission payments as a result of the 29% year-to-year increase
in net sales and, to a lesser extent, increased legal costs
associated with patent and intellectual property activity and
other expense increases associated with selling and marketing
activities.

Special Charges — Fiscal 2005

Closure of Wafer Fabrication Facility

— During
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we recorded a special charge
of $20 million as a result of a decision to close our
California wafer fabrication operations and transfer production
to facilities located in Massachusetts and Ireland, as well as
to third-party wafer fabricators. The charge was for severance
and fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to our
ongoing benefit plan for 339 manufacturing employees and 28
general and administrative employees. As of October 29,
2005, the employment of none of these employees had been
terminated. In addition to the charge recorded in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2005, we expect to incur additional expenses
related to this action during fiscal 2006. These additional
charges will consist of approximately $22 million of
non-cash cost of sales expense for additional depreciation due
to the shortened useful lives of certain manufacturing
equipment, approximately $2.4 million for stay-on bonuses
and approximately $6 million for estimated lease
termination and clean-up costs. The closure of these facilities
is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2006 and is
estimated to result in cost savings of approximately
$44 million per year beginning in fiscal 2007. These
savings are expected to be realized as follows: approximately
$43 million in cost of sales, of which approximately
$7 million relates to non-cash depreciation savings, and
approximately $1 million in selling, marketing, general and
administrative expense.

Reorganization of Product Development and Support
Programs

— During the fourth quarter of fiscal
2005, we recorded a special charge of $11 million as a
result of our decision to reorganize our product



development and support programs with the goal of providing
greater focus on our analog and DSP product programs. The charge
was for severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded
pursuant to our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements
at foreign locations for 60 manufacturing employees and 154
engineering and selling, marketing, general and administrative
employees. As of October 29, 2005, the employment of 49 of
these employees had been terminated. In addition to this charge
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we expect to incur
approximately $2 million of additional expenses related to
this action during fiscal 2006. The additional expenses relate
to facilities closure costs and estimated lease termination
costs. Most of this action is expected to be completed by the
end of the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and will be fully
completed by the end of fiscal 2006. These organizational
changes are expected to result in savings of approximately
$19 million per year once fully completed by the end of
fiscal 2006. These savings are expected to be realized as
follows: approximately $9 million in research and
development expense, approximately $6 million in selling,
marketing, general and administrative expense and approximately
$4 million in cost of sales.

Special Charges — Fiscal 2003

Fiscal 2003 — Fourth Quarter Special
Charge

— During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003,
we recorded a special charge of $9.2 million as a result of
a decision to close a small manufacturing facility in Belfast,
Northern Ireland that supplied foundry substrate services for
optical applications. The charge included $2.0 million of
severance and fringe benefit costs for approximately 57
manufacturing employees and 14 engineering and
administrative employees all of which had been paid by the end
of the second quarter of fiscal 2004. The charge also included
$6 million related to the write-down of property, plant and
equipment to its fair value and $1.2 million related to the
write-down of various other assets to their fair values. The
closure was completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2004.

Fiscal 2003 — Third Quarter Special
Charge

— During the third quarter of fiscal 2003,
we recorded a special charge of $0.3 million. The charge
included a $2.0 million write-down of equipment to fair
value due to a decision to outsource the assembly of products in
plastic packages, which had been done internally at our facility
in the Philippines. This amount was the net book value of the
assets used in plastic assembly, net of proceeds received from
the sale in the third quarter of a portion of the assets. We
also decided to abandon efforts to develop a particular
expertise in optical communications that resulted in the
write-down of $2.7 million of equipment to its fair value.
During the quarter ended August 2, 2003, we determined that
costs remaining to be paid for certain previous restructuring
charges would be less than the amount originally recorded, and
accordingly, we recorded a change in estimate reducing the
restructuring accruals by $4.4 million.

The decrease in operating income in fiscal 2005 as compared to

gross margin combined with a $31 million special charge in
fiscal year 2005 partially offset by operating expense decreases.

The increase in operating income in fiscal 2004 as compared to
fiscal 2003 was primarily a result of the 410 basis point
year-to-year improvement in gross margin offset by operating
expense increases that were limited to 14%, which was less than
half the 29% increase in net sales for the year.

The year-to-year increase in interest income in fiscal 2005 as
compared to fiscal 2004 was attributable to higher interest
rates as a result of actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board,
as well as higher average invested cash balances. The
year-to-year decrease in interest income in fiscal 2004 as
compared to fiscal 2003 was attributable to lower average
invested cash balances in fiscal 2004 due to the note redemption
in 2003. This was partially mitigated by our decision in fiscal
2004 to increase our holdings of longer term, high-credit
quality bonds, which offer higher yields than shorter-term
investments, and higher interest rates later in fiscal 2004 as a
result of actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board.

Fiscal 2003 included interest expense for our
$1,200 million 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes
that we redeemed on October 1, 2003.

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004, or the AJCA, was signed into law. The AJCA creates a
temporary incentive for US multinational corporations to
repatriate accumulated foreign income by providing an 85%
dividends received deduction for certain dividends from
controlled foreign corporations. During fiscal 2005, we
repatriated $1,055 million of accumulated foreign earnings.
Under current tax law, the earnings repatriated prior to
October 29, 2005 were taxed at a reduced effective tax
rate. As a result of this action, we recorded additional income
tax expense of $49 million in fiscal 2005.

We had originally established a deferred tax asset on our
consolidated balance sheet with the expectation that the
officers subject to the 162(m) limitation of the Internal
Revenue Code would not withdraw their balances from the Analog
Devices, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, or the Deferred
Compensation Plan, while they were still subject to the 162(m)
limitation, and we would receive a tax deduction at the time of
withdrawal, generally upon their retirement. Due to recent
changes in tax law that were enacted as part of the AJCA, the
laws associated with distributions from deferred compensation
plans have changed. As a result, three executive officers who
are currently subject to the 162(m) limitation have either
withdrawn, or have indicated their intention to withdraw, a
portion of their balances from the Deferred Compensation Plan.
We incurred additional income tax expense in fiscal 2005 of
$7.2 million as a result of the write-off of deferred tax
assets associated with balances accumulated in our Deferred
Compensation Plan.

Net income decreased by $156 million in fiscal 2005 as
compared to fiscal 2004. This decrease was primarily the result
of the year-to-year decrease in net sales, a $49 million
tax charge related to the repatriation of foreign earnings and
$31 million of special charges recorded in fiscal 2005.
These decreases were partially offset by a $36 million
increase in interest income.



Net income increased by $272 million in fiscal 2004 as
compared to fiscal 2003. The improvement in net income in fiscal
2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the
year-to-year increase in net sales, and, to a lesser extent, the
improvement in operating income as a percentage of net sales
from 18.3% recorded in fiscal 2003 to 26.6% recorded in fiscal
2004.

The impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate
movement on our business during the past three fiscal years has
not been significant.

Related Party Transaction

One of our directors, who has been a director since 1988, became
a director of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or
TSMC, in fiscal 2002. We purchased approximately
$224 million, $337 million and $232 million of
products from TSMC in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. We believe that the terms and prices for the
purchases of these products are at terms no less favorable than
those that could be obtained from unaffiliated parties.
Approximately $27 million and $15 million were payable
to TSMC as of October 29, 2005 and October 30, 2004,
respectively. We anticipate that we will make significant
purchases from TSMC in fiscal year 2006.

During fiscal 2005, net cash provided by operations decreased by

primarily due to a decline in net income of $156 million.
Cash and cash equivalents increased by $109 million during
fiscal 2005. This increase was the result of $673 million
of cash flow from operations, $89 million in proceeds from
our various employee stock programs and $70 million of cash
inflows from the net change in our short-term available-for-sale
investments. These cash inflows were partially offset by the
repurchase of $525 million of our common stock, the payment
of $119 million of cash dividends and additions to
property, plant and equipment of $85 million. Cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments increased by
$21 million during fiscal 2005 to $2,706 million at
October 29, 2005.

During fiscal 2004, net cash provided by operations increased by
$345 million from the amount recorded in the prior year
primarily due to the year-to-year increase in net income of
$272 million. During fiscal 2004, we received
$124 million in proceeds from our various employee stock
programs. These cash inflows were partially offset by the
repurchase of $137 million of our common stock, additions
to property, plant and equipment of $146 million and our
payment of cash dividends of $75 million in fiscal 2004.
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased by
$568 million during fiscal 2004 to $2,685 million at
October 30, 2004.

Days Cost of Sales in Inventory



Accounts receivable at the end of fiscal 2005 decreased by
$10 million, or 2.9%, from the amount at the end of fiscal
2004. This decrease was the result of a lower amount of
shipments in the last month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005
as compared to the last month of the fourth quarter of fiscal
2004.

Inventories decreased by $23 million, or 6.5%, and days
cost of sales in inventory declined by 9 days during fiscal
2005. This decrease was the result of our aggressive management
of spending related to back end



manufacturing and fabricated wafer purchases from external
foundries and a modest adjustment of our internal capacity.

Recent changes in tax law that were enacted as part of the AJCA,
had the effect that distributions from the Deferred Compensation
Plan after January 1, 2006 could be subject to more
stringent tax laws. As a result, some participants have elected
to withdraw, or indicated their intention to withdraw, a
portion, or all, of their balance from the Deferred Compensation
Plan prior to December 31, 2005. Accordingly, during the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, $234 million of our
non-current deferred compensation plan investments and the
offsetting liability became current.

Net additions to property, plant and equipment were
$85 million in fiscal 2005, $146 million in fiscal
2004 and $68 million in fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2006 capital
expenditures are expected to be approximately $126 million.

During fiscal 2005, our Board of Directors declared cash
dividends totaling $0.32 per outstanding share of common
stock resulting in dividend payments of $119 million in
fiscal 2005. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be
based on several factors including our financial performance,
outlook and liquidity. After the end of the fiscal year, on
November 14, 2005, our Board of Directors declared a cash
dividend of $0.12 per outstanding share of our common
stock. The dividend is payable on December 14, 2005 to
shareholders of record on November 25, 2005 and is expected
to be approximately $44 million.

On May 11, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized an
increase in the aggregate dollar amount of common stock that may
be repurchased under our share repurchase program previously
adopted by our Board of Directors on August 11, 2004 from
$500 million to $1 billion. We may repurchase
outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time on the
open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Management
will determine the timing and amount of share repurchases.
During fiscal 2004, we repurchased approximately
$137 million of our common stock under this plan. During
fiscal 2005, we repurchased approximately $525 million of
our common stock under this plan. Our previous repurchase
program announced on August 15, 2002 was terminated by
resolution of our Board of Directors on August 11, 2004.

Purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other
goods and services are not included in the table above. We are
not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders
that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may
represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding
agreements. In addition, our purchase orders generally allow for
cancellation without significant penalties. We do not have
significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or
other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that
exceed our expected short term requirements.

The expected timing of payment and amounts of the obligations
discussed above are estimated based on current information.

At October 29, 2005, our principal source of liquidity was
$2,706 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity
and cash expected to be generated from future operations,
together with anticipated available long-term financing, will be
sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures and research
and development efforts for at least the next twelve months and
thereafter for the foreseeable future.

Off-balance Sheet Financing

As of October 29, 2005, we had no off-balance sheet
financing arrangements.

Tentative Settlement of the SEC’s Previously Announced
Stock Option Investigation

In our Form 10-K filing dated November 30, 2004, we
disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) had initiated an inquiry into our stock option
granting practices, focusing on options that were granted
shortly before the issuance of favorable financial results. On
November 15, 2005, we announced that a tentative settlement
has been reached.

Since receiving notice of this inquiry, we have been cooperating
with the SEC and believe that the matter will be concluded in
the near future. We and our President and CEO, Mr. Jerald
G. Fishman, have made an offer of settlement to the Staff of the
SEC, which is subject to agreement regarding the specific
language of the SEC’s administrative order and other
settlement documents. The SEC Staff has decided to recommend the
offer of settlement to the Commission. A final settlement is
subject to review and approval by the Commission.

Our Board of Directors and Mr. Fishman, believe that it is
in the best interests of our shareholders to settle this case on
the proposed terms rather than face a protracted dispute with
the SEC.

The contemplated settlement addresses two separate issues. The
first issue concerns our disclosure regarding grants of options
to our employees and directors prior to the release of favorable
financial results. Specifically, the issue relates to options
granted to our employees (including officers) on
November 30, 1999 and to employees (including officers) and
directors on November 10, 2000. The SEC settlement would
conclude that we should have made disclosures in our proxy
filings to the effect that we priced these stock options prior
to releasing favorable financial results.

The second issue addressed by the tentative settlement concerns
the grant dates for options granted to our employees (including
officers) in 1998 and 1999, and the grant date for options
granted to employees (including officers) and directors in 2001.
Specifically, the settlement would conclude that the appropriate
grant date for the September 4, 1998 options should have
been
September 8

th

(which
is one trading day later than the date that was used to price
the options); the appropriate grant date for the
November 30, 1999



options should have been
November 29

th

(which
is one trading day earlier than the date that was used); and the
appropriate grant date for the July 18, 2001 options should
have been
July 26

th

(which
is five trading days after the original date).

In connection with the contemplated settlement, we would consent
to a cease-and-desist order under Section 10(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, would
pay a civil money penalty of $3 million, and would reprice
options granted to Mr. Fishman and other directors in
certain years. Options granted to all other employees would be
excluded from the repricing. Mr. Fishman would consent to a
cease-and-desist order under Sections 17(a)(2) and
(3) of the Securities Act, would pay a civil money penalty
of $1 million, and would make a disgorgement payment with
respect to options granted in certain years. With the exception
of options granted in 1998, Mr. Fishman has not exercised
or sold any of the options identified in this matter. We and
Mr. Fishman would settle this matter without admitting or
denying the Commission’s findings.

We have determined that no restatement of our historical
financial results would be necessary due to the proposed
settlement, because the effects of using revised measurement
dates for options granted in 1998, 1999 and 2001 are not
material to any of the fiscal years 1998 through 2005, based on
the materiality guidelines contained in SAB 99. If a
stock-based compensation charge had been taken as a result of
the revised measurement dates for these option grants to all
employees (including officers) and directors, our net income for
fiscal years 1998 through 2005 would have been reduced by
$21.8 million in total. During this period, we earned
cumulative net income of over $2.5 billion. There would be
no impact on revenue, cash flow from operations, or
shareholders’ equity as a result of using the revised
measurement dates. The impact on net income in individual fiscal
years would have been as follows: fiscal 1998
($0.2 million), fiscal 1999 ($1.4 million), fiscal
2000 ($1.8 million), fiscal 2001 ($3.7 million),
fiscal 2002 ($8.1 million), fiscal 2003
($6.1 million), fiscal 2004 ($0.5 million).

Outlook

We are planning for revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2006
to be similar to the levels recorded in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2005. With the adoption of SFAS 123(R) in the first
quarter of fiscal 2006, we estimate that stock-based
compensation expense will have an impact on diluted earnings per
share of approximately $0.04 in the first quarter of fiscal
2006. Including this stock-based compensation expense we expect
diluted earnings per share to be approximately $0.31 for the
first quarter of fiscal 2006.

New Accounting Pronouncements

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections

In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 154,

Accounting Changes and Error
Corrections

(SFAS 154) which supersedes APB Opinion
No. 20,

Accounting Changes

and SFAS No. 3,

Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial
Statements

. SFAS 154 provides guidance on the
accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error
corrections. It establishes, unless impracticable, retrospective
application as the required method for reporting a change in
accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition
requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle.
The correction of an error in previously issued financial
statements is not an accounting change. However, the reporting
of an error correction involves adjustments to previously issued
financial statements similar to those generally applicable to
reporting an accounting change retroactively. Therefore, the
reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously
issued financial statements is also addressed by this Statement.
SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and
corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2005. We do not expect the adoption of
SFAS 154 to have a material impact on our consolidated
results of operations and financial condition.

Asset Retirements

In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47
(FIN 47),

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations — an interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 143

. FIN 47 clarifies that the term



“conditional asset retirement obligation” as used in
FASB Statement No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations

, refers to a legal obligation to perform an
asset retirement activity in which the timing and
(or) method of settlement are conditional on a future event
that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The
obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is
unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing
and (or) method of settlement. Uncertainty about the timing
and (or) method of settlement of a conditional asset
retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of
the liability when sufficient information exists. FIN 47
also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information
to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement
obligation. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of
fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. We are
currently analyzing FIN 47 and believe the adoption of
FIN 47 will not have a material impact on our financial
condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Nonmonetary Assets

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,

Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets — an amendment of
APB Opinion No. 29

, (SFAS 153). SFAS 153 is
based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets
should be measured based on the fair value of the assets
exchanged. SFAS 153 eliminates the exception for
nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces
it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets
that do not have commercial substance. SFAS 153 is
effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges in fiscal periods
beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of
SFAS 153 in our fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2005 did
not impact our financial condition, results of operations, or
liquidity.

Inventory Costs

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,

Inventory Costs, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin
(ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4

(SFAS 151).
SFAS 151 amends the guidance in ARB No 43, Chapter 4,
“Inventory Pricing,” to clarify that abnormal amounts
of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted
material (spoilage) should be recognized as current-period
charges. In addition, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of
fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on
the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions
of SFAS 151 are effective for fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 2005. We are currently evaluating the provisions
of SFAS 151 and do not believe that its adoption will have
a material impact on our financial condition, results of
operations or liquidity.

Stock-Based Compensation

On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123
(revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

, which is a revision
of SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

(SFAS 123(R)). SFAS 123(R) supersedes
APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees

, and amends SFAS No. 95,

Statement of
Cash Flows

. SFAS 123(R) requires all share-based
payments to employees, including grants of employee stock
options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their
fair values at the date of grant. Pro forma disclosure is no
longer an alternative.

SFAS 123(R) permits public companies to adopt its
requirements using one of two methods. The “modified
prospective” method recognizes compensation cost beginning
with the effective date (a) based on the requirements of
SFAS 123(R) for all share-based payments granted after the
effective date and (b) based on the requirements of
SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the
effective date of SFAS 123(R) that remain unvested on the
effective date. The “modified retrospective” method
includes the requirements of the modified prospective method
described above, but also permits entities to restate their
historical financial statements based on the amounts previously
recognized under SFAS 123 for purposes of pro forma
disclosures either (a) for all prior periods presented or
(b) for prior interim periods of the year of adoption.

As permitted by SFAS 123, we currently account for
share-based payments to employees using APB Opinion
No. 25’s intrinsic value method and, as such,
generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock
options. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS 123(R) will have
a significant impact on our results of



operations, although it will have no impact on our overall
financial position. SFAS 123(R) is required to be adopted
effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2006.
We adopted SFAS 123(R) in fiscal year 2006 on
October 30, 2005 using the modified prospective method. We
estimate that expense related to share-based payments to
employees will have an impact on diluted earnings per share of
approximately $0.04 in the first quarter of fiscal 2006.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of the financial
condition and results of operations is based upon the
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. The preparation of these financial statements
requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We
base our estimates and judgments on historical experience,
knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur
in the future given available information. We consider the
following accounting policies to be both those most important to
the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require
the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ
significantly from management’s estimates and projections,
there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We
also have other policies that we consider key accounting
policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including
the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the
products are sold to the end user; however, the application of
these policies does not require us to make estimates or
judgments that are difficult or subjective.

Inventory Valuation

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out
method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the
semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels,
obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write
down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of
methodologies to determine the amount of inventory reserves
necessary. While a portion of the reserve is determined via
reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market
calculations, an element of the reserve is subject to
significant judgments made by us about future demand for our
inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our
estimates, additional reserves for existing inventories may need
to be recorded in future periods.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate,
for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our
customers to make required payments. If the financial condition
of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may
exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be
required.

Long-Lived Assets

We review property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these
assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to
future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to
generate over their remaining economic lives. If such assets are
considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in
earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the
assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a
quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing
a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no
material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant,
and equipment during the past three fiscal years, except those
made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in
our business in the future could lead to such impairment
adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of
long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results
that are used in the preparation of the expected future
undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the
remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ
from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these
assets. These differences could result in impairment charges,
which could have a material adverse impact on our results of
operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be
impaired but their



estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations,
we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised
useful lives.

Goodwill

In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, or SFAS 142,

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

. As required by SFAS 142, goodwill is
subject to annual impairment tests, or earlier if indicators of
potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value
of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted
future cash flows. Because we have one reporting segment under
SFAS 142, we utilize the entity-wide approach to assess
goodwill for impairment and compare our market value to our net
book value to determine if an impairment exists. These
impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have
a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Accounting for Income Taxes

We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, or SFAS 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

, which requires that deferred
tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates
for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax
bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS 109 also
requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation
allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all
of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We evaluate the
realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly. At
October 29, 2005, we had gross deferred tax assets of
$142 million primarily resulting from temporary differences
between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. We
have conducted an assessment of the likelihood of realization of
those deferred tax assets and concluded that a $42 million
valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the
deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the
expiration of state credit carryovers. In reaching our
conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the
existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb
deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years
that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable
income in future years. Our judgments regarding future
profitability may change due to future market conditions,
changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other
factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments
to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net
income or an increase in net loss in the period when such
determinations are made.

In addition, we have provided for potential liabilities due in
various jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining our
worldwide income tax expense provision. In the ordinary course
of global business, there are many transactions and calculations
where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these
uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and
royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe
our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the
final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than
that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions
and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on
our income tax provision and operating results in the period in
which such determination is made.

Contingencies

From time to time, we receive notices that our products or
manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or
intellectual property rights of others. We periodically assess
each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be
recorded in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 5, or SFAS 5,

Accounting for
Contingencies

. In making this determination, we may,
depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and
external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the
information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all
the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether
it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and
whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated.
Should a loss be probable and reasonably estimable, we record a
contingent loss in accordance with SFAS 5. In determining
the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received
from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal
proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior
case history and other factors. Should the judgments and
estimates made by us be incorrect, we may need to record
additional contingent losses that could materially adversely
impact our results of operations.



See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements
contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains or incorporates
forward-looking statements within the meaning of
section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These
forward-looking statements are based on current expectations,
estimates, forecasts and projections about the industry and
markets in which we operate and management’s beliefs and
assumptions. In addition, other written or oral statements that
constitute forward-looking statements may be made by or on our
behalf. Words such as “expect,”
“anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,”
“believe,” “seek,” “estimate,”
variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to
identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are
not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks,
uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We
have included important factors in the cautionary statements
below under the heading “Factors That May Affect Future
Results” that we believe could cause our actual results to
differ materially from the forward-looking statements we make.
We do not intend to update publicly any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise.

Factors That May Affect Future Results

Our future operating results are difficult to predict and may
materially fluctuate.

Our future operating results are difficult to predict and may be
materially affected by a number of factors, including the timing
of new product announcements or introductions by us or our
competitors, competitive pricing pressures, fluctuations in
manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and
manufacturing capacity, the risk that our backlog could decline
significantly, our ability to hire, retain and motivate adequate
numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the
demands of our customers, changes in product mix, and the effect
of adverse changes in economic conditions in the United States
and international markets. In addition, the semiconductor market
has historically been cyclical and subject to significant
economic downturns. Our business is subject to rapid
technological changes and there can be no assurance, depending
on the mix of future business, that products stocked in
inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them. As
a result of these and other factors, there can be no assurance
that we will not experience material fluctuations in future
operating results on a quarterly or annual basis.

Long-term contracts are not typical for us and reductions,
cancelations or delays in orders for our products could
adversely affect our operating results.

In certain markets where end-user demand may be particularly
volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders
that require us to manufacture product and have it available for
shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a
binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product.
At any given time, this situation could affect a portion of our
backlog. As a result, we are subject to the risk of cancelation
of orders leading to a sharp fall-off of sales and backlog.
Further, those orders may be for products that meet the
customer’s unique requirements so that those canceled
orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable
products, resulting in potential inventory write-offs. As a
result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the
products subject to these uncertainties, the amount of
unsaleable product could be substantial. Reductions,
cancelations or delays in orders for our products could
adversely affect our operating results.

Our future success depends upon our ability to develop and
market new products and enter new markets.

Our success significantly depends on our continued ability to
develop and market new products. There can be no assurance that
we will be able to develop and introduce new products in a
timely manner or that new products, if developed, will achieve
market acceptance. In addition, our growth is dependent on our
continued ability to penetrate new markets where we have limited
experience and competition is intense. There can be no assurance
that the markets we serve will grow in the future, that our
existing and new products will meet



the requirements of these markets, that our products will
achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors
will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take
market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain profits
in these markets. Furthermore, a decline in demand in one or
several of our end-user markets could have a material adverse
effect on the demand for our products and our results of
operations. Also, some of our customers in these markets are
less established, which could subject us to increased credit
risk.

We may not be able to compete successfully in the
semiconductor industry in the future.

Many other companies offer products that compete with our
products. Some have greater financial, manufacturing, technical
and marketing resources than we have. Additionally, some
formerly independent competitors have been purchased by larger
companies. Our competitors also include emerging companies
selling specialized products to markets we serve. There can be
no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the
future against existing or new competitors, or that our
operating results will not be adversely affected by increased
price competition.

We rely on third-party subcontractors and manufacturers for
some industry-standard wafers and assembly/test services, and
therefore cannot control their availability or conditions of
supply.

We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on assembly and test
subcontractors and on third-party wafer fabricators to supply
most of our wafers that can be manufactured using
industry-standard submicron processes. This reliance involves
several risks, including reduced control over delivery
schedules, manufacturing yields and costs. Additionally, we
utilize third-party wafer fabricators as sole-source suppliers,
primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. These
suppliers manufacture components in accordance with our
proprietary designs and specifications. We have no written
supply agreements with these sole-source suppliers and purchase
our custom components through individual purchase orders. If
these sole-source suppliers are unable or unwilling to
manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to
us, on the time schedule and of the quality that we require, we
may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement
suppliers, which could result in additional expenses and delays
in product development or shipment of product to our customers.

We may not be able to satisfy increasing demand for our
products, and increased production may lead to overcapacity and
lower prices.

The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted
in sustained and short-term periods when demand for our products
has increased or decreased rapidly. During these periods of
rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be
sufficient to satisfy the available demand. We, and the
semiconductor industry generally, expand production facilities
and access to third-party foundries in response to these periods
of increased demand. These capacity expansions by us and other
semiconductor manufacturers could lead to overcapacity in our
target markets which could lead to price erosion that would
adversely impact our operating results.

Our revenue may not increase enough to offset the expense of
additional capacity.

We, and the semiconductor industry generally, expand production
facilities and access to third-party foundries in response to
periods of increased demand which can cause operating expenses
to increase. Should customer demand fail to increase or should
the semiconductor industry enter a period of reduced customer
demand, our financial position and results of operations could
be adversely impacted as a result of underutilization of
capacity or asset impairment charges.

We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary
rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively.

We rely primarily upon know-how, rather than on patents, to
develop and maintain our competitive position. There can be no
assurance that others will not develop or patent similar
technology or reverse



engineer our products or that the confidentiality agreements
upon which we rely will be adequate to protect our interests.
Other companies have obtained patents covering a variety of
semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to
obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from
making and selling the infringing products, if such patents are
found to be valid. There can be no assurance that we would be
able to obtain licenses, if required, upon commercially
reasonable terms, or at all. Moreover, the laws of foreign
countries in which we design, manufacture and market our
products may afford little or no effective protection of our
proprietary technology.

We are involved in frequent litigation regarding intellectual
property rights, which could be costly to defend and could
require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties.

There can be no assurance that any patent will issue on pending
applications or that any patent issued will provide substantive
protection for the technology or product covered by it. We
believe that patent and mask set protection is of less
significance in our business than experience, innovation and
management skill. There also can be no assurance that others
will not develop or patent similar technology, or reverse
engineer our products, or that our confidentiality agreements
with employees, consultants, silicon foundries and other
suppliers and vendors will be adequate to protect our interests.

The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims
and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property
rights, including claims arising under our contractual
indemnification of our customers. We have received from time to
time, and may receive in the future, claims from third parties
asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents
or other intellectual property rights. In the event a third
party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a
license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms,
or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop
production of products incorporating that intellectual property,
and our operating results could be materially and adversely
affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or
other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us
against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be
costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. See
Note 11 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial
Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K for information concerning pending litigation
that involves us. An adverse outcome in this or other litigation
could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial position or on our consolidated results of operations
or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved.

If we do not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute
our business strategy will be limited.

Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued
service of our executive officers and key management and
technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers, and
on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate
qualified personnel. The competition for these employees is
intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key
personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating
results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect
on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key
personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue
to attract qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key
person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees.

We rely on manufacturing capacity located in geologically
unstable areas, which could affect the availability of supplies
and services.

We, and many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on
internal manufacturing capacity located in California as well as
wafer fabrication foundries in Taiwan and other sub-contractors
in geologically unstable locations around the world. This
reliance involves risks associated with the impact of
earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry, including
temporary loss of capacity, availability and cost of key raw
materials and equipment and availability of key services
including transport. Any prolonged inability to utilize one of
our manufacturing facilities, or those of our subcontractors or
third-party wafer-fabrication foundries, as a result of fire,
natural disaster, unavailability of electric power or otherwise,
would have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and financial condition.



We are exposed to economic, political and other risks through
our significant worldwide operations.

During fiscal year 2005, approximately 75% of our revenues were
derived from customers in international markets. Although we
engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to
currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance
that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by
changes in the exchange rate of the United States dollar against
other currencies. Potential interest rate increases,
particularly in the United States and China, as well as high
energy costs could have an adverse impact on industrial and
consumer spending patterns and could adversely impact demand for
our products. We have manufacturing facilities outside the
United States in Ireland and the Philippines. In addition to
being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the
semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic and
political risks inherent in international operations and their
impact on the United States economy in general, including the
risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and
economic instability in many countries around the world as well
as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism, and the
response to them by the United States and its allies. These
risks include air transportation disruptions, expropriation,
currency controls, currency exchange rate movement, and
additional costs related to tax, tariff and freight rate
increases.

Our future operating results are dependent on the performance
of independent distributors and sales representatives.

A significant portion of our sales are through independent
distributors that are not under our control. These independent
distributors generally represent product lines offered by
several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts
applied to our products or terminate their representation of us.
We generally do not require letters of credit from our
distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable
default or bankruptcy by these distributors. Our inability to
collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our
results of operations. Termination of a significant distributor,
whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative,
could disrupt our current business. If we are unable to find
suitable replacements in the event of terminations by
significant distributors or sales representatives, our operating
results could be adversely affected.

Our manufacturing processes are highly complex and may be
interrupted.

We have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial
amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits
is a highly complex and precise process. Minute impurities,
contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in
the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer
manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer
breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of
wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be
nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in
semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes
could become unstable. This instability could result in
manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a
material adverse effect on our financial position or results of
operations.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Exposure

Our annual interest income would change by approximately
$16 million in fiscal 2005 and $19 million in fiscal
2004 for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in
interest rates. The fair values of our investment portfolio at
October 29, 2005 and October 30, 2004 would change by
approximately $14 million and $24 million,
respectively, for each 100 basis point increase or decrease
in rates.

Foreign Currency Exposure

As more fully described in Note 2 (i) in the Notes to
our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we regularly hedge our
non-U.S. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward
exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods
matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally
range from one month to six months. The short-term nature of
these



contracts has resulted in these instruments having insignificant
fair values at October 29, 2005 and October 30, 2004.
Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is against the
Euro, primarily because our European operations have a higher
proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative
to foreign currency exposures existing at October 29, 2005
and October 30, 2004, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign
currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant
losses in earnings or cash flows or significantly diminish the
fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments,
primarily due to the short lives of the affected financial
instruments that effectively hedge substantially all of our
year-end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates. The calculation assumes that each exchange rate
would change in the same direction relative to the
U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes
in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of
sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’
products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity
analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange
rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or
local currency selling prices.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

a.     Principles of
    Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries. Upon
consolidation, all intercompany accounts and transactions are
eliminated. The Company’s fiscal year ends on the 52-week
or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to the last day
in October. Fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 were 52-week years.

Certain amounts reported in previous years have been
reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2005 presentation. Such
reclassifications were immaterial.

b.     Cash, Cash Equivalents and
    Short-term Investments

Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with
insignificant interest rate risk and maturities of three months
or less at the time of acquisition. Cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments consist primarily of corporate
obligations such as commercial paper and corporate bonds, and
Treasury and government agency notes and bonds. They also
include bank time deposits, institutional money market funds and
taxable municipal bonds.

The Company classifies its investments in readily marketable
debt and equity securities as “held-to-maturity,”
“available-for-sale” or “trading” at the
time of purchase. There were no transfers between investment
classifications in any of the fiscal years presented.
Held-to-maturity securities, which are carried at amortized
cost, include only those securities the Company has the positive
intent and ability to hold to maturity. Securities, such as bank
time deposits, which by their nature are typically held to
maturity, are classified as such. The Company’s other
readily marketable investments are classified as
available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at
fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of related tax,
if any, reported in accumulated other comprehensive income,
which is a separate component of shareholders’ equity.
Realized gains and losses, as well as interest, and dividends on
all securities, are included in earnings.

The Company’s short-term investments are adjusted to fair
value at the end of each quarter. These adjustments to fair
value are recorded as an increase or decrease in accumulated
other comprehensive income. No realized gains or losses were
recorded during any of the fiscal years presented.



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company periodically evaluates these investments for
impairment in accordance with EITF Issue No. 03-01,

The
Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application
to Certain Investments.

When a decline in fair value is
deemed to be other-than-temporary, the Company records an
impairment adjustment in the statement of income. There were no
other-than-temporary impairments of short-term investments in
any of the fiscal years presented.

Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale marketable
securities were as follows:

There were no unrealized gains and losses on held-to-maturity
investments in any of the fiscal years presented.

There were no cash equivalents or short-term investments
classified as trading at October 29, 2005 and
October 30, 2004. All of the Company’s short-term
investments were classified as available-for-sale. The
components of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments as of October 29, 2005 and
October 30, 2004 were as follows:

The Company’s primary non-cash financing activities in
fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 resulted from the amortization of
unearned stock compensation expense associated with the
Company’s 2001 acquisitions for which 1,462,066 shares
of common stock were issued (valued at approximately
$81.8 million) and unvested stock options with an intrinsic
value of approximately $11.9 million were assumed. As a
result, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense
of approximately $3.6 million in fiscal 2005 and
$6.1 million in both fiscal 2004 and 2003. The
Company’s primary non-cash financing activities in fiscal
2003 were the result of the restructuring of an interest rate
swap in October 2002 (see Note 2i.). At the time of the
restructuring of the swap, the fair value of the interest rate
component of the debt was greater than the related carrying
value. This difference was amortized over the remaining life of
the swap as an adjustment to interest expense. As a result, the
Company recognized $7.5 million of expense in fiscal year
2003.

d.     Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out
method) or market. Inventories at October 29, 2005 and
October 30, 2004 were as follows:



Raw materials

$

12,414

$

11,281

Work in process

240,064

226,106

111,020

Total inventories

$

325,605

$

348,407

e.     Property, Plant and
    Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost less
allowances for depreciation. The straight-line method of
depreciation is used for all classes of assets for financial
statement purposes; both straight-line and accelerated methods
are used for income tax purposes. Capitalized leases and
leasehold improvements are amortized based upon the lesser of
the term of the lease or the useful life of the asset.
Depreciation and amortization are based on the following useful
lives:

Buildings & Building Equipment

Up to 25 years

Machinery & Equipment

3-8 years

Office Equipment

3-8 years

Total depreciation of property, plant and equipment was
$153 million, $150 million and $166 million in
fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company did not
capitalize interest in fiscal 2005, 2004 or 2003.

The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of
their carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows the
assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic
lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by
which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market
value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a
value determined by utilizing a



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

discounted cash flow technique. If such assets are not impaired,
but their useful lives have decreased, the remaining net book
value is amortized over the revised useful life.

f.     Goodwill and Intangible
    Assets

The Company annually evaluates goodwill for impairment as well
as whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable from estimated discounted
future cash flows. Because the Company has one reporting segment
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142
(SFAS 142), the Company utilizes the entity-wide approach
for assessing goodwill for impairment and compares the
Company’s market value to its net book value to determine
if an impairment exists. No impairment of goodwill resulted from
the Company’s evaluation of goodwill in any of the fiscal
years presented.

Intangible assets, which will continue to be amortized,
consisted of the following:

lives. Amortization expense was $2.4 million,
$2.7 million and $2.6 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively.

The Company expects annual amortization expense for these
intangible assets to be:

g.     Grant Accounting

The Company’s manufacturing facility in Limerick, Ireland
has received various grants from the Industrial Development
Authority of the Republic of Ireland. These grants include
capital, employment and research and development grants. Capital
grants for the acquisition of property and equipment are netted
against the related capital expenditures and amortized as a
credit to depreciation expense over the useful life of the
related asset. Employment grants, which relate to employee
hiring and training, and research and development grants are
recognized in earnings in the period in which the related
expenditures are incurred by the Company.

h.     Translation of Foreign
    Currencies

The functional currency for the Company’s foreign sales
operations is the applicable local currency. Gains and losses
resulting from translation of these foreign currencies into
U.S. dollars are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive (loss) income. Transaction gains and losses and
remeasurement of foreign currency denominated assets and
liabilities are included in income currently, including those at
the Company’s principal



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

foreign manufacturing operations where the functional currency
is the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains or
losses included in other expenses, net, were not material in
fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003.

i.     Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Agreements

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to
offset certain operational and balance sheet exposures from the
impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Such
exposures result from the portion of the Company’s
operations, assets and liabilities that are denominated in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily Japanese
Yen, Euro, and British Pounds Sterling. These foreign exchange
contracts are entered into to support product sales, purchases
and financing transactions made in the normal course of
business, and accordingly, are not speculative in nature. In
accordance with SFAS 133, hedges related to anticipated
transactions are designated and documented at the inception of
the respective hedges as cash flow hedges and are evaluated for
effectiveness monthly.

The Company records all derivative financial instruments in the
consolidated financial statements in accrued liabilities at fair
value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the
instrument. Changes in the fair value of the derivative
financial instruments are either recognized periodically in
earnings or in shareholders’ equity as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) or loss
depending on whether the derivative financial instrument
qualifies for hedge accounting as defined by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (SFAS 133),

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

. Changes in fair values of derivatives not
qualifying for hedge accounting are reported in earnings as they
occur.

Foreign Exchange Exposure Management

— The
Company has significant international sales and purchase
transactions in foreign currencies and has a policy of hedging
forecasted and actual foreign currency risk with forward foreign
exchange contracts. The Company’s forward foreign exchange
contracts are denominated in Japanese Yen, British Pounds
Sterling and the Euro and are for periods consistent with the
terms of the underlying transactions, generally one year or
less. Derivative instruments are employed to eliminate or
minimize certain foreign currency exposures that can be
confidently identified and quantified. In accordance with
SFAS 133, hedges related to anticipated transactions are
designated and documented at the inception of the respective
hedges as cash flow hedges and are evaluated for effectiveness
monthly. As the terms of the contract and the underlying
transaction are matched at inception, forward contract
effectiveness is calculated by comparing the change in fair
value of the contract to the change in the forward value of the
anticipated transaction, with the effective portion of the gain
or loss on the derivative instrument reported as a component of
OCI in shareholders’ equity and reclassified into earnings
in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects
earnings. Any residual change in fair value of the instruments,
or ineffectiveness, is recognized immediately in other
income/expense. No ineffectiveness was recognized in fiscal
2005, 2004 or 2003.

Additionally, the Company enters into forward foreign currency
contracts that economically hedge the gains and losses generated
by the remeasurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities
in a non-functional currency. Changes in the fair value of these
undesignated hedges are recognized in other income/expense
immediately as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the
asset or liability being hedged.

Interest Rate Exposure Management

— In the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company terminated a swap
agreement that had the effect of swapping the 4.75% fixed rate
of the Company’s Convertible Subordinated Notes (the
“Notes”) into a LIBOR-based floating rate. The swap
was terminated due to the Company’s decision to call for
the redemption of its Notes (see Note 8). The terminated
swap was originally entered into in January 2002 and hedged the
benchmark interest rate of the $1,200 million Notes. The
swap was a derivative instrument as defined by SFAS 133 and
was designated as a fair value hedge at inception. As the
critical terms of the interest rate swap and the underlying
interest component of the Company’s Notes were matched at
inception, effectiveness was calculated by comparing the change
in the fair value of the



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

contract to the change in the fair value of the interest rate
component, with the effective portion of the gain or loss on the
derivative instrument reported in other income/expense. The
Company evaluated this fair value hedge for effectiveness
quarterly, and restructured certain terms in October 2002 to
provide for an even more highly effective hedge relationship
with the Notes. The restructuring resulted in an interest rate
swap with terms more favorable to the Company, offset by a
promise to pay a fixed amount over time to the counterparty
regardless of when the swap was terminated. The restructuring,
which had no impact on earnings, increased the interest rate
swap asset by $27 million, with an offsetting debt
liability of an equal amount. The fair value hedge was
determined to be highly effective during each quarter, and a
minor amount of ineffectiveness was recorded in other
income/expense during fiscal year 2003.

Derivative financial instruments involve, to a varying degree,
elements of market and credit risk not recognized in the
consolidated financial statements. The market risk associated
with these instruments resulting from currency exchange rate or
interest rate movements is expected to offset the market risk of
the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being
hedged. The counterparties to the agreements relating to the
Company’s foreign exchange and interest rate instruments
consist of a number of major international financial
institutions with high credit ratings. The Company does not
believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by
these counterparties because the Company continually monitors
the credit ratings of such counterparties, and limits the
financial exposure with any one financial institution. While the
contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments
provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do
not represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to
credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk
(arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet
the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the
amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations
under the contracts exceed the obligations of the Company to the
counterparties.

Accumulated Derivative Gains or Losses

comprehensive (loss) income related to derivatives classified as

j.     Fair Values of Financial
    Instruments

The following estimated fair value amounts have been determined
by the Company using available market information and
appropriate valuation methodologies. The estimates presented
herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the
Company could realize in a current market exchange.

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company
in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial
instruments:

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments

— These investments, except for
those classified as held-to-maturity, which are carried at
amortized cost, are adjusted to fair value based on quoted
market values.

Deferred compensation plan investments and other
investments

— The fair value of these
investments is based on quoted market values, with the exception
of private-company equity investments that are carried at cost.

Interest rate swap and cap agreements

—
The fair value of interest rate swap and cap agreements is
obtained from dealer quotes. These values represent the
estimated amount the Company would receive or pay to terminate
the agreements taking into consideration current interest rates.

Forward foreign currency exchange
contracts

— The estimated fair value of
forward foreign currency exchange contracts, which includes
derivatives that are accounted for as cash flow hedges and those
that are not designated as cash flow hedges, is based on the
estimated amount at which they could be settled based on forward
market exchange rates.

k.     Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting period. Such estimates relate to the useful
lives of fixed assets, allowances for doubtful accounts and
customer returns, the net realizable value of inventory,
potential reserves relating to litigation matters, accrued
liabilities, accrued taxes, deferred tax valuation allowances
and other reserves. Actual results could differ from those
estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial
statements.

l.     Concentrations of Credit
    Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments
and trade accounts receivable.

The Company maintains cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments and long-term investments with high credit quality
financial institutions and monitors the amount of credit
exposure to any one financial institution and issuer.

The Company sells its products to distributors and original
equipment manufacturers involved in a variety of industries
including industrial process automation, instrumentation,
defense/aerospace, automotive, communications, computers and
computer peripherals and consumer electronics. The Company has
adopted credit policies and standards to accommodate growth in
these markets. The Company performs continuing credit
evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and
although the Company generally does not require collateral,
letters of credit may be required from its customers in certain
circumstances. Reserves are provided for estimated amounts of
accounts receivable that may not be collected.

m.     Concentration of Other
    Risks

The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid
technological change, competitive pricing pressures and cyclical
market patterns. The Company’s financial results are
affected by a wide variety of factors, including general
economic conditions worldwide, economic conditions specific to
the semiconductor industry, the timely implementation of new
manufacturing technologies, the ability to safeguard patents and
intellectual property in a rapidly evolving market and reliance
on assembly and test subcontractors, third-party wafer
fabricators and independent distributors. In addition, the
semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject
to significant economic downturns at various times. The Company
is exposed to the risk of obsolescence of its inventory
depending on the mix of future business. Additionally, the
Company utilizes third-party wafer fabricators as sole-source
suppliers, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
As a result, the Company may experience significant
period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results due to
the factors mentioned above or other factors.

n.     Revenue Recognition

Revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to
distributors are deferred until the distributors resell the
products to end-users. Deferred amounts are presented net and
included as “Deferred income on shipments to
distributors” in the Company’s consolidated balance
sheets. Revenue from product sales to end-users is recognized
when title passes, which for shipments to certain foreign
countries is subsequent to product shipment. Title for these
shipments ordinarily passes within a week of shipment. A reserve
for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based
on historical experience or specific identification of an event
necessitating a reserve.

Shipping costs are charged to cost of sales as incurred.

The Company generally offers a 12-month warranty for its
products. The Company’s warranty policy provides for
replacement of the defective product. Specific accruals are
recorded for known product warranty issues. Product warranty
expenses during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 were not material.

o.     Accumulated Other
    Comprehensive (Loss) Income

Other comprehensive (loss) income includes certain transactions
that have generally been reported in the consolidated statement
of shareholders’ equity. Accumulated other comprehensive
(loss) income is comprised of minimum pension liability
adjustments, unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale
securities, foreign currency translation adjustments and net
gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow
hedges.

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense
was $10.5 million in fiscal 2005, $11.9 million in
fiscal 2004 and $12.1 million in fiscal 2003.

q.     Income Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets
and liabilities and are measured using the enacted income tax
rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the
temporary differences are expected to reverse. Additionally,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are separated into current
and noncurrent amounts based on the classification of the
related assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes.

r.     Earnings Per Share of
    Common Stock

Basic earnings per share is computed based only on the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period,
plus the dilutive effect of potential future issuances of common
stock relating to stock option programs and other potentially
dilutive securities. In calculating diluted earnings per share,
the dilutive effect of stock options is computed using the
average market price for the respective period. Potential shares
related to convertible debt and certain of the Company’s
outstanding stock options were excluded because they were
anti-dilutive. Those potential shares related to the
Company’s outstanding



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

stock options could be dilutive in the future. The following
table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings
per share:

s.     Stock-Based
    Compensation

As permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) 148 and SFAS 123, the Company applies the
accounting provisions of Accounting Principle Board Opinion
No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issues to Employees,

and related interpretations with regard to the measurement of
compensation cost for options granted under the Company’s
equity compensation plans, consisting of the 2001 Broad-Based
Stock Option Plan, the 1998 Stock Option Plan, the Restated
1994 Director Option Plan, the Restated 1988 Stock Option
Plan, the 1992 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the 1998
International Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

On March 29, 2005 the SEC released Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 107

Share-Based Payment,

(SAB 107), which interpreted SFAS 123(R). Based on
this regulatory guidance the Company has reevaluated the methods
and assumptions used to estimate the value of employee stock
options granted in fiscal 2005. Management believes that implied
volatility more accurately measures expected volatility due to
the fact that it generally reflects the markets’
expectations of the future volatility of the underlying
security. Options in the Company’s stock are traded on
several exchanges. Management believes that using implied
volatility will result in a more accurate estimate of the value
of employee stock options. The Company uses a third-party
specialist to calculate the implied volatility for the period
that is commensurate with its expected term assumption. Because
this term often exceeds the period for which there are exchange
traded options in the Company’s stock, the specialist uses
statistical techniques to derive the implied volatility. This
calculation of implied volatility is based on the most recent
five day period of trades of the Company’s exchange traded
options as of the day of grant.

On October 18, 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of
all unvested stock options granted after December 31, 2000
awarded to employees under its stock option plans that had
exercise prices of $40.00 or greater. Options issued to
corporate officers and directors were not accelerated. Unvested
options to purchase approximately 18 million shares became
exercisable as a result of the vesting acceleration.



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In connection with the modification of the terms of these
options to accelerate their vesting, approximately
$134 million, net of tax, is included in the pro forma
table below for the fiscal year ended October 29, 2005
representing the remaining unamortized value of the impacted,
unvested options. Because the exercise price of all the modified
options was greater than the market price of the Company’s
underlying common stock on the date of their modification, no
compensation expense was recorded in the statement of income in
accordance with APB 25.

The primary purpose for modifying the terms of these options to
accelerate their vesting was to eliminate the need to recognize
remaining unrecognized non-cash compensation expense in the
Company’s statement of income associated with these options
as measured under SFAS 123(R). The approximately
$188 million ($134 million net of tax) of future
expense associated with these options would have been
disproportionately high compared to the economic value of the
options as of the date of modification. SFAS 123(R) is
required to be adopted by the Company effective the beginning of
the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and will require that
compensation expense associated with stock options be recognized
in the statement of income, rather than being disclosed in a pro
forma footnote to the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

The fair value of the Company’s stock-based awards to
employees was estimated using the following weighted average
assumptions.

Had expense been recognized using the fair value method
described in SFAS 123, using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model, the Company would have reported the
following results of operations:

As disclosed in Note 11, on November 15, 2005 the
Company announced that a tentative settlement of the SEC’s
previously announced stock option investigation has been
reached. The Company has determined that no restatement of its
historical financial results would be necessary due to the
proposed settlement, because the effects of using revised
measurement dates for options granted in 1998, 1999 and 2001 are
not material to any of the fiscal years 1998 through 2005, based
on the materiality guidelines contained in SAB 99.
Accordingly, the tables presented above have not been restated
to reflect the effects of using the revised measurement dates.

SFAS No. 123(R) clarifies the timing for recognizing
compensation expense for awards subject to acceleration of
vesting on retirement. This compensation expense must be
recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date
retirement eligibility is met if it is shorter than the vesting
term. Upon adoption of SFAS 123(R) in the first quarter of
fiscal 2006, the Company’s policy regarding the timing of
option expense recognition for employees eligible for retirement
will be changed to recognize compensation cost over the period
through the date that the employee is no longer required to
provide service to earn the award. Prior to the adoption of
SFAS 123(R), the Company’s policy was to recognize
these compensation costs over the vesting term. Had the Company
applied these non-substantive vesting provisions required by
SFAS 123(R), the impact on the pro forma net earnings
presented above would have been immaterial for all fiscal years
presented.

t.     New Accounting
    Standards

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections

In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) issued SFAS No. 154,

Accounting Changes
and Error Corrections

(SFAS 154) which supersedes APB
Opinion No. 20,

Accounting Changes

and
SFAS No. 3,

Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim
Financial Statements.

SFAS 154 provides guidance on the
accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error
corrections. It establishes, unless impracticable, retrospective
application as the required method for reporting a change in
accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition
requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle.
The correction of an error in previously issued financial
statements is not an accounting change. However, the reporting
of an error correction involves adjustments to previously issued
financial statements similar to those



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

generally applicable to reporting an accounting change
retroactively. Therefore, the reporting of a correction of an
error by restating previously issued financial statements is
also addressed by this Statement. SFAS 154 is effective for
accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company does
not expect the adoption of SFAS 154 to have a material
impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial
condition.

Asset Retirements

In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations — an interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 143

(FIN 47). FIN 47 clarifies that the
term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in
SFAS 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations

, and refers to a legal obligation to perform an
asset retirement activity in which the timing and
(or) method of settlement are conditional on a future event
that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The
obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is
unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing
and (or) method of settlement. Uncertainty about the timing
and (or) method of settlement of a conditional asset
retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of
the liability when sufficient information exists. FIN 47
also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information
to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement
obligation. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of
fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The Company is
currently analyzing FIN 47 and believes the adoption of
FIN 47 will not have a material impact on the
Company’s financial condition, results of operations or
liquidity.

Nonmonetary Assets

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,

Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets — an amendment of
APB Opinion No. 29

(SFAS 153). SFAS 153 is
based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets
should be measured based on the fair value of the assets
exchanged. SFAS 153 eliminates the exception for
nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces
it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets
that do not have commercial substance. SFAS 153 is
effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges in fiscal periods
beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of
SFAS 153 in our fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2005 did
not impact the Company’s financial condition, results of
operations or liquidity.

Inventory Costs

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,

Inventory Costs, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin
(ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4

(SFAS 151).
SFAS 151 amends the guidance in ARB No. 43,
Chapter 4, “Inventory Pricing,” to clarify that
abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling
costs, and wasted material (spoilage) should be recognized
as current-period charges. In addition, SFAS 151 requires
that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of
conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production
facilities. The provisions of SFAS 151 are effective for
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company is
currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS 151 and does
not believe that its adoption will have a material impact on the
Company’s financial condition, results of operations or
liquidity.

Stock-Based Compensation

On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123
(revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment,

which is a revision
of SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

(SFAS 123(R)). SFAS 123(R) supersedes
APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,

and amends SFAS No. 95,

Statement of
Cash Flows

. SFAS 123(R) requires all share-based
payments to employees, including grants of



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement
based on their fair values at the date of grant. Pro forma
disclosure is no longer an alternative.

SFAS 123(R) permits public companies to adopt its
requirements using one of two methods. A “modified
prospective” method recognizes compensation cost beginning
with the effective date (a) based on the requirements of
SFAS 123(R) for all share-based payments granted after the
effective date and (b) based on the requirements of
SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the
effective date of SFAS 123(R) that remain unvested on the
effective date. A “modified retrospective” method
includes the requirements of the modified prospective method
described above, but also permits entities to restate their
historical financial statements based on the amounts previously
recognized under SFAS 123 for purposes of pro forma
disclosures either (a) for all prior periods presented or
(b) for prior interim periods of the year of adoption.

As permitted by SFAS 123, the Company currently accounts
for share-based payments to employees using APB Opinion
No. 25’s intrinsic value method and, as such,
generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock
options. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS 123(R) will have
a significant impact on the Company’s results of
operations, although it will have no impact on the
Company’s overall financial position. SFAS 123(R) is
required to be adopted effective at the beginning of the first
quarter of fiscal 2006. The Company adopted SFAS 123(R) in
fiscal year 2006 on October 30, 2005 using the modified
prospective application method. The Company estimates that
expense related to share-based payments to employees will have
an impact on diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.04
in the first quarter of fiscal 2006.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company recorded a
special charge of $20 million as a result of a decision to
close its California wafer fabrication operations and transfer
production to facilities located in Massachusetts and Ireland,
as well as to third-party wafer fabricators. The charge was for
severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant
to the Company’s ongoing benefit plan for 339 manufacturing
employees and 28 general and administrative employees. As of
October 29, 2005, the employment of none of these employees
had been terminated. In addition to the charge recorded in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company expects to incur
additional expenses related to this action during fiscal 2006.
These additional charges will consist of approximately
$22 million of non-cash cost of sales expenses for
additional depreciation

due to shortened useful lives of certain manufacturing
equipment, approximately $2.4 million for stay-on bonuses
and approximately $6 million for estimated lease
termination and clean-up costs. The closure of these facilities
is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2006.

Fiscal 2005 — Reorganization of Product Development
    and Support Programs

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company recorded a
special charge of $11 million as a result of its decision
to reorganize its product development and support programs with
the goal of providing greater focus on its analog and DSP
product programs. The charge was for severance and fringe
benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to the Company’s
ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign
locations for 60 manufacturing employees and 154 engineering and
selling, manufacturing, general and administrative employees. As
of October 29, 2005, the employment of 49 of these
employees had been terminated. In addition to this charge in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company expects to incur
approximately $2 million of additional expenses related to
this action during fiscal 2006. The additional expenses relate
to facilities closure costs and estimated lease termination
costs. Most of this action is expected to be complete by the end
of the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and will be fully completed
by the end of fiscal 2006.

Fiscal 2003 Special Charges:

Fiscal 2003 — Fourth Quarter Special Charge

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company recorded a
special charge of $9.2 million as a result of a decision to
close a small manufacturing facility in Belfast, Northern
Ireland that supplied foundry substrate services for optical
applications. The charge included $2.0 million of severance
and fringe benefit costs for approximately 57 manufacturing
employees and 14 engineering and administrative employees all of
which had been paid by the end of the second quarter of fiscal
2004. The charge also included $6 million related to the
write-down of property, plant and equipment to its fair value
and $1.2 million related to the write-down of various other
assets to their fair values. The closure was completed during
the second quarter of fiscal 2004.

Fiscal 2003 — Third Quarter Special Charge

During the third quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company recorded a
special charge of $0.3 million. The charge included a
$2.0 million write-down of equipment to fair value due to a
decision to outsource the assembly of products in plastic
packages, which had been done internally at the Company’s
facility in the Philippines. This amount was the net book value
of the assets used in plastic assembly, net of proceeds

received from the sale in the third quarter of a portion of the
assets. The Company also decided to abandon efforts to develop a
particular expertise in optical communications that resulted in
the write-down of $2.7 million of equipment to its fair
value. During the quarter ended August 2, 2003, the Company
determined that costs remaining to be paid for certain previous
restructuring charges would be less than the amount originally
recorded and the Company recorded a change in estimate reducing
the restructuring accruals by $4.4 million.

The fair values of these investments are based on published
market quotes on October 29, 2005 and October 30,
2004, respectively. Adjustments to fair value of, and income
pertaining to, deferred compensation plan investments are
recorded in operating expenses. Gross realized and unrealized
gains and losses from trading securities were not material in
fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003.

Investments are offset by a corresponding liability to the plan
participants (see Note 9). These investments are
specifically designated as available to the Company solely for
the purpose of paying benefits under the Company’s deferred
compensation plan. However, in the event the Company became
insolvent, the investments would be available to all unsecured
general creditors.

6.

Other Investments

Other investments consist of equity securities and other
long-term investments. Investments are stated at fair value,
which is based on market quotes, interest rates or management
estimates, as appropriate. Adjustments to fair value of
investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded as an
increase or decrease in accumulated other comprehensive (loss)
income, unless the adjustment is considered an
other-than-temporary impairment, in which case the adjustment is
recorded as a charge in the statement of income.

There were no realized gains or losses recorded in fiscal 2005
or fiscal 2003. Realized losses of $1.7 million were
recorded in fiscal 2004.

$1.8 million ($1.2 million net of tax) were recorded
in fiscal 2004 and unrealized gains of $4.2 million
($2.7 million net of tax) were recorded in fiscal 2003.

Long-term investments classified as available-for-sale were
approximately $2.4 million and $3.9 million at
October 29, 2005 and October 30, 2004, respectively.

Debt and Credit Facilities

The Company had no debt or short-term borrowings outstanding at
October 29, 2005 and October 30, 2004.

On October 1, 2003, the Company redeemed its
$1,200 million 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes
(Notes), which were due in October 2005 but allowed for early
redemption. The redemption price was 101.90% of the principal
amount of the Notes or $1,223 million. The Company
recognized a net loss on debt extinguishment of
$0.2 million in fiscal 2003, which was comprised of a gain
on the Notes redemption of $10.8 million due to the
carrying value of the Notes being greater than the redemption
value as a result of the mark-to-market of the interest rate
component, which was being hedged by an interest rate swap
agreement, of the Notes to fair value. This gain was offset by a
write-off of $11.0 million of deferred financing fees. This
net loss is included in fiscal 2003 in Other, net in the
consolidated statements of income.

9.

Deferred Compensation Plan Liability and Other Noncurrent
    Liabilities

The deferred compensation plan liability relates to obligations
due under the Analog Devices, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan
(the “Deferred Compensation Plan”). The Deferred
Compensation Plan allows certain members of management and other
highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer
receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. Prior to
January 1, 2005, participants could also defer gains on
stock options and restricted stock granted before July 23,
1997. The balance represents Deferred Compensation Plan
participant accumulated deferrals, and earnings thereon, since
the inception of the Deferred Compensation Plan, net of
withdrawals. The total expense to the Company of the Deferred
Compensation Plan was $9.9 million in fiscal 2005,
$15.9 million in fiscal 2004 and $17.8 million in
fiscal 2003. The Company’s liability under the Deferred
Compensation Plan is an unsecured general obligation of the
Company. Other noncurrent liabilities primarily relate to
pension liabilities.

10.

Lease Commitments

The Company leases certain of its facilities, equipment and
software under various operating leases that expire at various
dates through 2015. The lease agreements frequently include
renewal and escalation clauses and require the Company to pay
taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. Total rental expense
under operating leases was approximately $45 million in
fiscal 2005, $43 million in fiscal 2004, and
$41 million in fiscal 2003.

Commitments and Contingencies

Tentative Settlement of the SEC’s Previously Announced
    Stock Option Investigation

In the Company’s Form 10-K filing dated
November 30, 2004, the Company disclosed that the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had initiated an
inquiry into its stock option granting practices, focusing on
options that were granted shortly before the issuance of
favorable financial results. On November 15, 2005, the
Company announced that a tentative settlement has been reached.

Since receiving notice of this inquiry, the Company has been
cooperating with the SEC and believes that the matter will be
concluded in the near future. The Company and its President and
CEO, Mr. Jerald G. Fishman, have made an offer of
settlement to the Staff of the SEC, which is subject to
agreement regarding the specific language of the SEC’s
administrative order and other settlement documents. The SEC
Staff has decided to recommend the offer of settlement to the
Commission. A final settlement is subject to review and approval
by the Commission.

The Company’s Board of Directors and Mr. Fishman
believe that it is in the best interests of the Company’s
shareholders to settle this case on the proposed terms rather
than face a protracted dispute with the SEC.

The contemplated settlement addresses two separate issues. The
first issue concerns the Company’s disclosure regarding
grants of options to employees and directors prior to the
release of favorable financial results. Specifically, the issue
relates to options granted to employees

(

including
officers

)

of the Company on November 30, 1999 and to
employees

(

including officers

)

and directors of
the Company on November 10, 2000. The SEC settlement would
conclude that the Company should have made disclosures in its
proxy filings to the effect that the Company priced these stock
options prior to releasing favorable financial results.

The second issue addressed by the tentative settlement concerns
the grant dates for options granted to employees

(

including officers

)

in 1998 and 1999, and the
grant date for options granted to employees (including
officers

)

and directors in 2001. Specifically, the
settlement would conclude that the appropriate grant date for
the September 4, 1998 options should have been
September 8

th

(which
is one trading day later than the date that was used to price
the options); the appropriate grant date for the
November 30, 1999 options should have been
November 29

th

(which
is one trading day earlier than the date that was used); and the
appropriate grant date for the July 18, 2001 options should
have been
July 26

th

(which
is five trading days after the original date).

In connection with the contemplated settlement, the Company
would consent to a cease-and-desist order under
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and
Rule 10b-5 thereunder, would pay a civil money penalty of
$3 million, and would reprice options granted to
Mr. Fishman and other directors in certain years.



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Options granted to all other employees would be excluded from
the repricing. Mr. Fishman would consent to a
cease-and-desist order under Sections 17(a)(2) and
(3) of the Securities Act, would pay a civil money penalty
of $1 million, and would make a disgorgement payment with
respect to options granted in certain years. With the exception
of options granted in 1998, Mr. Fishman has not exercised
or sold any of the options identified in this matter. The
Company and Mr. Fishman would settle this matter without
admitting or denying the Commission’s findings.

The Company has determined that no restatement of its historical
financial results would be necessary due to the proposed
settlement, because the effects of using revised measurement
dates for options granted in 1998, 1999 and 2001 are not
material to any of the fiscal years 1998 through 2005, based on
the materiality guidelines contained in SAB 99. If a
stock-based compensation charge had been taken as a result of
the revised measurement dates for these option grants to all
employees (including officers) and directors, the net income of
the Company for fiscal years 1998 through 2005 would have been
reduced by $21.8 million in total. During this period, the
Company earned cumulative net income of over $2.5 billion.
There would be no impact on revenue, cash flow from operations,
or shareholders’ equity as a result of using the revised
measurement dates. The impact on net income in individual fiscal
years would have been as follows: fiscal 1998
($0.2 million), fiscal 1999 ($1.4 million), fiscal
2000 ($1.8 million), fiscal 2001 ($3.7 million),
fiscal 2002 ($8.1 million), fiscal 2003
($6.1 million), fiscal 2004 ($0.5 million).

Other Commitments and Contingencies

On June 14, 2005, Biax Corporation filed its first amended
complaint for patent infringement in the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the Company and
Intel Corporation, alleging that the Company infringed three
patents owned by Biax relating to parallel processors. On
November 7, 2005, Biax filed a second amended complaint
alleging that the Company infringed two additional patents.
Prior to the filing of the first amended complaint, the Company
was unaware of Biax or this action. The first amended complaint
seeks injunctive relief, unspecified damages with interest, as
well as Biax’s costs, expenses and fees. On August 3,
2005, the Company filed an answer and counterclaimed against
Biax. In the counterclaim, the Company seeks rulings that the
patents are not infringed, the patents are invalid and the
patents are unenforceable. The case has not yet entered the
discovery phase. The Company intends to vigorously defend
against these allegations. The Company is unable at this time to
predict the outcome of this litigation.

On November 6, 2003, Enron Corporation commenced a
proceeding in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
Southern District of New York. On December 1, 2003, Enron
filed an amended complaint to add the Company as a defendant in
such proceeding. The amended complaint alleges that transfers
made by Enron in satisfaction of obligations it had under
commercial paper are recoverable as preferential transfers and
fraudulent transfers and are subject to avoidance under the
United States Bankruptcy Code. It is alleged that payments made
in premature satisfaction of obligations under commercial paper
totaling approximately $20 million are recoverable from
J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc., Fleet Capital Markets, Fleet
National Bank and/or the Company. The Company sold
$20 million of Enron commercial paper to Fleet and did not
enter into any direct transactions with Enron. The Company filed
a motion to dismiss the adversary proceeding. The motion to
dismiss was denied by order dated June 30, 2005. The
Company intends to vigorously defend against these claims.
Although the Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the
asserted claims, it is unable at this time to predict the
outcome of this proceeding.

The Company is currently under routine audit by the United
States Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) for fiscal
years 2001, 2002 and 2003. The audit has not been completed and
the IRS has not issued a report on its audit.

From time to time as a normal incidence of the nature of the
Company’s business, various claims, charges and litigation
are asserted or commenced against the Company arising from, or
related to, contractual matters,

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

patents, trademarks, personal injury, environmental matters,
product liability, insurance coverage and personnel and
employment disputes. As to such claims and litigation the
Company can give no assurance that it will prevail.

The Company does not believe that any of the matters above will
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
consolidated results of operations or financial position,
although an adverse outcome of any of these matters is possible
and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the quarter
or annual period in which one or more of these matters are
resolved.

Shareholders’ Equity

Stock Plans

On December 5, 2001, the Board of Directors approved the
2001 Broad-Based Stock Option Plan (2001 Plan), which provides
for the issuance of stock options to purchase up to
50 million shares of common stock. The 2001 Plan provides
for the issuance of stock options to non-officer employees,
consultants and advisors at a price not less than 100% of the
fair market value of the common stock at the time the option is
granted. The Company cannot grant options under the 2001 Plan to
directors or officers.

In fiscal 1998, the shareholders approved the 1998 Stock Option
Plan (1998 Plan), which provides for the issuance of
nonstatutory and incentive stock options to purchase up to
30 million shares of common stock. In March 2000, the
shareholders approved an amendment to the 1998 Plan to increase
the shares reserved for issuance by an additional
34 million shares. Officers, employees, directors,
consultants and advisors of the Company and its subsidiaries are
eligible to be granted options under this plan at a price not
less than 100% (110% in the case of incentive stock options
granted to 10% or greater shareholders) of the fair market value
of the common stock on the date the option is granted. The
Company’s 1988 Stock Option Plan (1988 Plan) was terminated
upon adoption of the 1998 Plan; however, options to purchase
common stock remain outstanding under the 1988 Plan.

While the Company may grant to employees options that become
exercisable at different times or within different periods, the
Company has generally granted to employees options that are
exercisable on a cumulative basis in annual installments of


/


%
on each of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date
of grant or in annual installments of 25% on each of the second,
third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant.

The Board of Directors authorized that from and after
March 14, 2000, all options granted to non-employee
directors will be granted under the 1998 Plan, under which each
non-employee director is granted annually a non-statutory stock
option to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price
equal to the fair market value on the date of grant. The options
granted to directors under the 1998 Plan are exercisable on a
cumulative basis in annual installments of


/


%
on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the date
of grant. The Company’s 1994 Director Option Plan,
which was restated in 1998, was terminated effective
March 14, 2000; however, options to purchase shares of
common stock remain outstanding under the 1994 Director
Option Plan.

Options exercisable at October 30, 2004 and
November 1, 2003 were 32,688,000 and 29,097,000,
respectively.

The Company has an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) that
allows eligible employees to purchase, through payroll
deductions, shares of the Company’s common stock at 85% of
the fair market value at specified dates. Employees purchased a
total of 399,073 shares of common stock under this plan in
fiscal 2005 (411,355 shares and 414,382 shares in
fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively) for a total purchase
price of $12.6 million ($13.1 million and
$12.9 million in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003,
respectively). At October 29, 2005, a total of 1,329,198
common shares remained available for issuance under the ESPP.

Under the 1991 Restricted Stock Plan, which expired in December
2000, a maximum of 5,400,000 shares of common stock were
authorized for awards by the Company to key employees for
nominal consideration. Shares awarded under the plan were
restricted as to transfer, usually for a period of five years
and, under certain conditions, were subject to repurchase by the
Company at the original purchase price per share. During



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, there was no compensation expense
recorded in connection with grants made under this plan. During
fiscal 2003, $0.4 million of compensation expense was
recorded in connection with grants made under this plan. As of
October 29, 2005, there were no common shares that remained
subject to forfeiture under the 1991 Restricted Stock Plan.

As of October 29, 2005, a total of 110,275,905 common
shares were reserved for issuance under the Company’s stock
plans.

Common Stock Repurchase

In August 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors approved
the repurchase of up to $500 million of the Company’s
common stock. On May 11, 2005, the Company’s Board of
Directors amended the stock repurchase program by increasing the
total amount of the Company’s common stock the Company can
repurchase from $500 million to $1 billion of common
stock. Under the repurchase program, the Company may repurchase
outstanding shares of its common stock from time to time in the
open market and through privately negotiated transactions.
Unless terminated earlier by resolution of the Company’s
Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when the
Company has repurchased all shares authorized for repurchase
under the repurchase program. As of October 29, 2005, the
Company had repurchased 18,488,456 shares of its common
stock under this plan for approximately $663 million at an
average purchase price of $35.86 per share.

Preferred Stock

The Company has 471,934 authorized shares of $1.00 par
value preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding.
The Board of Directors is authorized to fix designations,
relative rights, preferences and limitations on the preferred
stock at the time of issuance. An aggregate of
300,000 shares of preferred stock have been designated as
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock for issuance
in connection with the Company’s Stockholder Rights Plan.

Common Stock Purchase Rights

In March 1998, the Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder
Rights Plan (the Stockholder Rights Plan) that replaced a plan
adopted by the Board in 1988. Pursuant to the Stockholder Rights
Plan, after giving effect to the Company’s two-for-one
stock split effected on March 15, 2000, each share of the
Company’s common stock currently has an associated one-half
of a right. Under certain circumstances, each whole right would
entitle the registered holder to purchase from the Company one
one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $180 in cash, subject to
adjustment.

The rights are not exercisable and cannot be transferred
separately from the common stock until ten business days (or
such later date as may be determined by the Board of Directors)
after (i) the public announcement that a person or group of
affiliated or associated persons has acquired (or obtained
rights to acquire) beneficial ownership of 15% or more of common
stock or (ii) the commencement of a tender offer or
exchange offer that would result in a person or group
beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding common stock.
If and when the rights become exercisable, each holder of a
right shall have the right to receive, upon exercise, that
number of shares of common stock (or in certain circumstances,
cash, property or other securities of the Company) that equals
the exercise price of the right divided by 50% of the current
market price (as defined in the Stockholder Rights Plan) per
share of common stock at the date of the occurrence of such
event. In the event that at any time after any person becomes an
acquiring person, (i) the Company is consolidated with, or
merged with and into, another entity and the Company is not the
surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or if the
Company is the surviving entity, but shares of its outstanding
common stock are changed or exchanged for stock or securities or
cash or any other property, or (ii) 50% or more of the
Company’s assets or earning power is sold or transferred,
each holder of a right shall thereafter



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

have the right to receive upon exercise, that number of shares
of common stock of the acquiring company that equals the
exercise price of the right divided by 50% of the current market
price of such common stock at the date of the occurrence of the
event.

The rights have certain anti-takeover effects, in that they
would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that
attempts to acquire a significant interest in the Company on
terms not approved by the Board of Directors. The rights expire
on March 17, 2008 but may be redeemed by the Company for
$.001 per right at any time prior to the tenth day
following a person’s acquisition of 15% or more of the
Company’s common stock. So long as the rights are not
separately transferable, each new share of common stock issued
will have one-half of a right associated with it.

13.

Retirement Plans

The Company and its subsidiaries have various savings and
retirement plans covering substantially all employees. The
Company maintains a defined contribution plan for the benefit of
its eligible United States employees. This plan provides for
Company contributions of up to 5% of each participant’s
total eligible compensation. In addition, the Company
contributes an amount equal to each participant’s pre-tax
contribution, if any, up to a maximum of 3% of each
participant’s total eligible compensation. The total
expense related to the defined contribution plan was
$22.8 million in fiscal 2005, $22.1 million in fiscal
2004 and $21.6 million in fiscal 2003. The Company also has
various defined benefit pension and other retirement plans for
certain non-U.S. employees that are consistent with local
statutory requirements and practices. The total expense related
to the various defined benefit pension and other retirement
plans for certain non-U.S. employees was $12.8 million
in fiscal 2005, $10.2 million in fiscal 2004 and
$8.9 million in fiscal 2003.

Non-U.S. Plan Disclosures

The Company’s funding policy for its foreign defined
benefit pension plans is consistent with the local requirements
of each country. The plans’ assets consist primarily of
U.S. and non-U.S. equity securities, bonds, property and
cash. The benefit obligations and related assets under these
plans have been measured at September 30, 2005 and
September 30, 2004.

Net annual periodic pension cost of non-U.S. plans is
presented in the following table:

September 30, 2005 and $34.2 million,
$28.8 million and $12.8 million, respectively, at
September 30, 2004.

The range of assumptions used for the non-U.S. defined
benefit plans reflects the different economic environments
within the various countries. The projected benefit obligation
was determined using the following weighted average assumptions:

The expected long-term rate of return on assets is a weighted
average of the long-term rates of return selected for the
various countries where the Company has funded pension plans.
The expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption is
selected based on the facts and circumstances that exist as of
the measurement date, and the specific portfolio mix of plan
assets. Management, in conjunction with its actuaries, reviewed
anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset
categories and considered the asset allocation strategy adopted
by the Company and or the trustees of the plans. While the
review considered recent fund performance and historical
returns, the assumption is primarily a long-term, prospective
rate.

Expected fiscal 2006 Company contributions and estimated future
benefit payments are as follows:

The fundamental goal underlying the pension plans’
investment policy is to achieve a total rate of return that
exceeds inflation over the long-term by using a certain mix of
assets depending on the profile of the specific plan. Investment
practices must comply with applicable laws and regulations.

The Company’s investment strategy is based on an
expectation that equity securities will outperform debt
securities over the long term. Accordingly, in order to maximize
the return on assets, a majority of assets are invested in
equities. Investments within each asset class are diversified to
reduce the impact of losses in single investments. The use of
derivative instruments is permitted where appropriate and
necessary to achieve overall investment policy objectives and
asset class targets.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage
targets and appropriate benchmarks for each significant asset
class to obtain a prudent balance between return and risk. The
interaction between plan assets and benefit obligations is
periodically studied by the Company and its actuaries to assist
in the establishment of strategic asset allocation targets.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

On October 22, 2004, the U.S. enacted the American
Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (“AJCA”). The AJCA created a
temporary incentive for U.S. multinational corporations to
repatriate accumulated foreign income by providing an 85%
dividends received deduction for certain dividends from
controlled foreign corporations. The Company decided to
repatriate $1,055 million in extraordinary dividends, as
defined by the AJCA, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005
and accordingly has recorded a tax liability of
$48.7 million at October 29, 2005.

The Company continues to intend to reinvest certain of its
foreign earnings indefinitely. Accordingly, no US income taxes
have been provided for approximately $992 million of
unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries. As of
October 29, 2005, the amount of unrecognized deferred tax
liability on these earnings was $180 million.

The significant components of the Company’s deferred tax
assets and liabilities for the fiscal years ended
October 29, 2005 and October 30, 2004 are as follows:

The valuation allowances of $42.2 million and
$32.8 million at October 29, 2005 and October 30,
2004, are a full valuation allowance for the Company’s
state credit carryovers that will begin to expire in 2006.

The Company has provided for potential liabilities due in
various jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining the
worldwide income tax expense provision. In the ordinary course
of global business, there are many transactions and calculations
where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these
uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement
arrangements among related entities. Although the Company
believes its estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given
that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be
different than that which is reflected in the historical income
tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a
material impact on the Company’s income tax provision and
operating results in the period in which such determination is
made.

The Company is currently under routine audit by the United
States Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) for fiscal
years 2001, 2002 and 2003. The audit has not been completed and
the IRS has not issued a report on its audit.

Related Party Transactions

Certain of the Company’s directors are affiliated with
companies that sell products to the Company. Management believes
the terms and prices for the purchases of these products are no
less favorable than those that could be obtained from
unaffiliated parties. One of the Company’s directors became
a director of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company
(TSMC) during fiscal 2002. The Company purchased
approximately $224 million, $337 million and
$232 million of product from TSMC in fiscal year 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively, and approximately $27 million and
$15 million was payable to TSMC as of October 29, 2005
and October 30, 2004, respectively. Management anticipates
that the Company will make significant purchases from TSMC in
fiscal year 2006.

Subsequent Event

On November 14, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company
declared a cash dividend of $0.12 per outstanding share of
common stock. The dividend will be paid on December 14,
2005 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on
November 25, 2005.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Analog Devices, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Analog Devices, Inc. as of October 29, 2005 and
October 30, 2004, and the related consolidated statements
of income, shareholders’ equity, comprehensive income, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
October 29, 2005. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(c). These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Analog Devices, Inc. at October 29,
2005 and October 30, 2004, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended October 29, 2005, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Analog Devices, Inc.’s internal control
over financial reporting as of October 29, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated November 18, 2005
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a)

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures.

Our management, with the participation of our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated
the effectiveness of Analog’s disclosure controls and
procedures as of October 29, 2005. The term
“disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means
controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in
the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time
periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to the company’s management, including its principal
executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies
its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of
possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of October 29, 2005,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal
control over financial reporting is defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or
under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive
and principal financial officers and effected by the
company’s board of directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and includes those
policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of the company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
    that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
    only in accordance with authorizations of management and
    directors of the company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of October 29, 2005. In
making this assessment, the company’s management used the
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework.

Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of
October 29, 2005, our internal control over financial
reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Our independent auditors have issued an audit report on our
assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.
This report appears below.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Analog Devices, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, that Analog Devices, Inc. maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
October 29, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal
Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO
criteria). Analog Devices, Inc.’s management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Analog
Devices, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of October 29, 2005, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria.
Also, in our opinion, Analog Devices, Inc. maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of October 29, 2005, based on the COSO
criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Analog Devices, Inc. as of
October 29, 2005 and October 30, 2004, and the related
consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity,
comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended October 29, 2005 of Analog
Devices, Inc. and our report dated November 18, 2005
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Changes in Internal Controls.

No change in our
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange
Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended October 29,
2005 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
