PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Company
    Overview

We are a world leader in the design, manufacture and marketing
    of a broad portfolio of high-performance analog, mixed-signal
    and digital signal processing integrated circuits (ICs) used in
    virtually all types of electronic equipment. Since our inception

    such as temperature, pressure, sound, light, speed and motion
    into electrical signals to be used in a wide array of electronic
    devices. As new generations of digital applications evolve, new
    needs for high-performance analog signal processing and digital
    signal processing (DSP) technology are generated. As a result,
    we produce a wide range of innovative products —
    including data converters, amplifiers and linear products, radio
    frequency (RF) ICs, power management products, sensors based on
    micro-electro mechanical systems (MEMS) technology and other
    sensors, and processing products, including DSP and other
    processors — that are designed to meet the needs of a
    broad base of customers.

We focus on key strategic markets where our signal processing
    technology is often a critical differentiator in our
    customers’ products, in particular, the industrial,
    automotive, consumer and communications markets. Used by over
    60,000 customers worldwide, our products are embedded inside

Industry
    Background

Semiconductor components are the electronic building blocks used
    in electronic systems and equipment. These components are
    classified as either discrete devices (such as individual
    transistors) or integrated circuits (in which a number of
    transistors and other elements are combined to form a more
    complicated electronic circuit). Integrated circuits may be
    divided into two general categories, digital and analog. Digital
    circuits, such as memory


devices and microprocessors, generally process on-off electrical
    signals, represented by binary digits, “1” and
    “0.” In contrast, analog integrated circuits monitor,
    condition, amplify or transform continuous analog signals
    associated with physical properties, such as temperature,
    pressure, weight, light, sound or motion, and play an important
    role in bridging between real world phenomena and a variety of
    electronic systems. Analog ICs also provide voltage regulation
    and power control to electronic systems.

Organizational
    Structure

We operate in one reporting segment, which is comprised of two
    separate groups, one focused on products and one focused on end
    markets. The product group is focused on core technology
    development and leadership in converters, amplifiers and RF,
    MEMS, power management, and DSP. The end market-focused
    organization is dedicated to understanding, selecting, and
    resourcing initiatives that are more customized to a particular
    market or application. The focus of this team is to apply the
    full expanse of our broad technology portfolio to more
    integrated and targeted product strategies for the industrial,
    automotive, consumer, and communications markets. The end market
    group includes our sales organization.

These two groups collaborate at all levels. On the one hand, our
    product group develops key technology for use by the end market
    groups, which apply these technologies to specific applications.
    Equally important, the applications expertise within each end
    market group is used to enhance core technology development by
    our product group.

Principal
    Products

We design, manufacture and market a broad line of
    high-performance ICs that incorporate analog, mixed-signal and
    digital signal processing technologies. Our ICs are designed to
    address a wide range of real-world signal processing
    applications. Our product portfolio includes both
    general-purpose products used by a broad range of customers and
    applications, as well as application-specific products designed
    for specific clusters of customers in key target markets. By
    using readily available, high-performance, general-purpose
    products in their systems, our customers can reduce the time
    they need to bring new products to market. Given the high cost
    of developing more customized ICs, our standard products often
    provide a cost-effective solution for many low to medium volume
    applications. However, for some industrial, automotive,
    consumer, and communications products, we focus on working with
    leading customers to design application-specific solutions. We
    begin with our existing core technologies in data conversion,
    amplification, RF, MEMS, power management and DSP, and devise a
    solution to more closely meet the needs of a specific customer
    or group of customers. Because we have already developed the
    core technology for our general-purpose products, we can create
    application-specific solutions quickly.

We produce and market several thousand products and operate in
    one reporting segment. Our ten highest revenue products, in the
    aggregate, accounted for approximately 8% of our revenue for
    fiscal 2011. A breakdown of our fiscal 2011 revenue by product
    category follows.

Analog
    Products

Our analog and mixed signal IC technology has been the
    foundation of our business for over four decades, and we are one
    of the world’s largest suppliers of high-performance analog
    ICs. Our analog signal processing ICs are primarily
    high-performance devices, offering higher dynamic range, greater
    bandwidth, and other enhanced features. The principal advantages
    these products have versus competitors’ products include
    higher accuracy, higher speed, lower cost per function, smaller
    size, lower power consumption and fewer components, resulting in


improved reliability. Our product portfolio includes several
    thousand analog ICs, any one of which can have as many as
    several hundred customers. Our analog ICs typically have long
    product life cycles. Our analog IC customers include original
    equipment manufacturers OEMs and customers who build electronic
    subsystems for integration into larger systems.

Converters

— We are a leading supplier of data
    converter products. Data converters translate real-world analog
    signals into digital data and also translate digital data into
    analog signals. Data converters remain our largest and most
    diverse product family and an area where we are continuously
    innovating to enable our customers to redefine and differentiate
    their products. Our converter products combine sampling rates
    and accuracy with the low noise, power, price and small package
    size required by industrial, automotive, consumer, and
    communications electronics.

Amplifiers/Radio Frequency

— We are also a
    leading supplier of high-performance amplifiers. Amplifiers are
    used to condition analog signals. High performance amplifiers
    emphasize the performance dimensions of speed and precision.
    Within this product portfolio we provide precision,
    instrumentation, high speed, intermediate frequency/RF,
    broadband, and other amplifiers. We also offer an extensive
    portfolio of precision voltage references that are used in a
    wide variety of applications. Our analog product line also
    includes a broad portfolio of high performance RF ICs covering
    the entire RF signal chain, from industry-leading stand-alone RF
    function blocks such as phase locked loops, frequency
    synthesizers, mixers, modulators, demodulators, and power
    detectors, to highly integrated broadband and short-range single
    chip transceiver solutions. Our high performance RF ICs support
    the high performance requirements of cellular infrastructure and
    a broad range of applications in our target markets.

Other Analog

— Also within our analog
    technology portfolio are products that are based on
    Micro-ElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) technology. This
    technology enables us to build extremely small sensors that
    incorporate an electromechanical structure and the supporting
    analog circuitry for conditioning signals obtained from the
    sensing element. Our MEMS product portfolio includes
    accelerometers used to sense acceleration, gyroscopes used to
    sense rotation, inertial measurement units used to sense
    multiple degrees of freedom combining multiple sensing types
    along multiple axis, and MEMS microphones used to sense audio.
    The majority of our current revenue from MEMS products is
    derived from the automotive, industrial, healthcare, and
    consumer end markets. In addition to our MEMs our other analog
    product category includes isolators that enable designers to
    implement isolation in designs without the cost, size, power,
    performance, and reliability constraints found with
    optocouplers. Our isolators have been designed into hundreds of
    applications, such as universal serial bus isolation in patient
    monitors, where it allows hospitals and physicians to adopt the
    latest advances in computer technology to supervise patient
    health and wirelessly transmit medical records. In smart
    metering applications, our isolators provide reliable
    electrostatic discharge performance that helps reduce meter
    tampering. Likewise, in satellites, where any malfunction can be
    catastrophic, our isolators help protect the power system while
    enabling designers to achieve small form factors.

Power Management & Reference

— Power
    management & reference products make up the balance of
    our analog sales. Those products that include functions such as
    power conversion, driver monitoring, sequencing and energy
    management, are developed to complement analog signal chain
    components across core market segments from micro power,
    energy-sensitive battery applications to efficient, high
    performance power systems in infrastructure and industrial
    applications.

Digital
    Signal Processing Products

Digital Signal Processing products (DSPs) complete our product
    portfolio. DSPs are optimized for high-speed numeric
    calculations, which are essential for instantaneous, or
    real-time, processing of digital data generated, in most cases,
    from analog to digital signal conversion. Our DSPs are designed
    to be fully programmable and to efficiently execute specialized
    software programs, or algorithms, associated with processing
    digitized real-time, real-world data. Programmable DSPs are
    designed to provide the flexibility to modify the device’s
    function quickly and inexpensively using software. Our
    general-purpose DSP IC customers typically write their own
    algorithms using software development tools provided by us and
    third-party suppliers. Our DSPs are designed in families of


products that share common architectures and therefore can
    execute the same software across a range of products. We support
    these products with easy-to-use development tools, which are
    designed to reduce our customers’ product development costs
    and

time-to-market.

Our customers use our products to solve a wide range of signal
    processing challenges across our core market and segment focus
    areas within the industrial, automotive, consumer and
    communications end markets. As an integrated part of our
    customer’s signal chain, there are typically many other
    Analog Devices products connected to our processors including
    converters, audio and video codecs and power management
    solutions.

Markets
    and Applications

During fiscal year 2011, we consolidated the computer end
    market, which represented approximately 1% of fiscal 2011
    revenue, into the consumer end market, and reclassified handset
    revenue, which represented approximately 3% of fiscal 2011
    revenue, from the communications end market to the consumer end
    market for all periods presented. The breakdown of our fiscal
    2011 revenue by end market is set out in the table below.

Research
    and Development

Our markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and
    advances. Accordingly, we make substantial investments in the
    design and development of new products and manufacturing
    processes, and the improvement of existing products and
    manufacturing processes. We spent approximately
    $506 million during fiscal 2011 on the design, development
    and improvement of new and existing products and manufacturing
    processes, compared to approximately $492 million during
    fiscal 2010 and approximately $447 million during fiscal
    2009.


Our research and development strategy focuses on building
    technical leadership in core technologies of converters,
    amplifiers and RF, MEMS, power management, and DSP. In support
    of our research and development activities, we employ thousands
    of engineers involved in product and manufacturing process
    development throughout the world.

Patents
    and Other Intellectual Property Rights

We seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our
    technology and products through the use of patents, copyrights,
    mask works, trademarks and trade secrets. We have a program to
    file applications for and obtain patents, copyrights, mask works
    and trademarks in the United States and in selected foreign
    countries where we believe filing for such protection is
    appropriate. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and
    confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through
    the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements. We have
    obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the
    United States and in other countries. As of October 29,
    2011, we held approximately 1,700 U.S. patents and
    approximately 700 non-provisional pending U.S. patent
    applications. There can be no assurance, however, that the
    rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing
    products in every jurisdiction. While our patents, copyrights,
    mask works, trademarks and trade secrets provide some advantage
    and protection, we believe our competitive position and future
    success is largely determined by such factors as the system and
    application knowledge, innovative skills, technological
    expertise and management ability and experience of our
    personnel; the range and success of new products being developed
    by us; our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing
    efforts; and customer service and technical support. It is
    generally our policy to seek patent protection for significant
    inventions that may be patented, though we may elect, in certain
    cases, not to seek patent protection even for significant
    inventions, if we determine other protection, such as
    maintaining the invention as a trade secret, to be more
    advantageous. We also have trademarks that are used in the
    conduct of our business to distinguish genuine Analog Devices
    products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs to
    promote our brands and identify products containing genuine
    Analog Devices components.

We sell our products globally through a direct sales force,
    third-party distributors, independent sales representatives and
    via our website. We have direct sales offices, sales
    representatives

and/or

distributors in over 40 countries outside North America.

We support our worldwide technical direct field sales efforts by
    an extensive promotional program that includes editorial
    coverage and paid advertising in trade publications, direct mail
    programs, promotional brochures, technical seminars and
    participation in trade shows. We publish and distribute product
    catalogs, applications guides, technical handbooks and detailed
    data sheets for individual products. We also provide this
    information and sell products via our website. We maintain a
    staff of field application engineers who aid customers in
    incorporating our products into their products. In addition, we
    offer a variety of web-based tools that ease product selection
    and aid in the design process for our customers.

We derived approximately 55% of our fiscal 2011 revenue from
    sales made through distributors. These distributors typically
    maintain an inventory of our products. Some of them also sell
    products that compete with our products, including those for
    which we are an alternate source. In all regions of the world,
    we defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to
    distributors until the distributors resell the products to their
    customers. We make sales to distributors under agreements that
    allow distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to
    return qualifying products for credit, as determined by us, in
    order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or
    obsolete product from their inventory. These agreements limit
    such returns to a certain percentage of our shipments to that
    distributor during the prior quarter. In addition, distributors
    are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the
    relationship with the distributor. Additional information
    relating to our sales to distributors is set forth in
    Note 2n in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Segment
    Financial Information and Geographic Information

We operate and track our results in one reportable segment based
    on the aggregation of five operating segments.


Through subsidiaries and affiliates, we conduct business in
    numerous countries outside the United States. During fiscal
    2011, we derived approximately 82% of our revenue from customers
    in international markets. Our international business is subject
    to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations,
    including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and
    controls, import and export controls, and other laws, policies
    and regulations of foreign governments. Although we engage in
    hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange
    rate fluctuations, our competitive position may be adversely
    affected by changes in the exchange rate of the United States
    dollar against other currencies.

The categorization of sales into geographic regions set forth
    below is based upon the location of the customer.

Customers

We have tens of thousands of customers worldwide. No sales to an
    individual customer accounted for more than 10% of fiscal year
    2011, 2010, or 2009 revenue. These customers used hundreds of
    different types of our products in a wide range of applications
    spanning the industrial, automotive, consumer and communication
    markets. Our largest single customer, excluding distributors,
    represented approximately 4% of our fiscal 2011 revenue. Our 20
    largest customers, excluding distributors, accounted for
    approximately 32% of our fiscal 2011 revenue.

Seasonality

Sales to customers during our first fiscal quarter may be lower
    than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our
    customers during the holiday season. In general, the seasonality
    for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on
    our results of operations. In addition, as explained in our risk
    factors contained in Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

our revenue is more likely to be influenced on a quarter to
    quarter basis by cyclicality in the semiconductor industry.

Production
    and Raw Materials

Monolithic integrated circuit components are manufactured in a
    sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer
    fabrication, wafer testing, cutting the wafer into individual
    “chips,” or dice, assembly of the dice into packages
    and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form.
    The raw materials used to manufacture these devices include
    silicon wafers, processing chemicals (including liquefied
    gases), precious metals and ceramic and plastic used for
    packaging.

We develop and employ a wide variety of proprietary
    manufacturing processes that are specifically tailored for use
    in fabricating high-performance analog, DSP, mixed-signal and
    MEMS ICs. We also use bipolar and complementary metal-oxide
    semiconductor, or CMOS, wafer fabrication processes.

Our IC products are fabricated both at our production facilities
    and by third-party wafer fabricators. Our products are
    manufactured in our own wafer fabrication facilities using
    proprietary processes and at third-party wafer-fabrication
    foundries using

sub-micron

digital CMOS processes. A significant portion of our revenue in
    fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 was from products fabricated at
    third-party wafer-fabrication facilities, primarily Taiwan
    Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC. We operate wafer
    fabrication facilities in Wilmington,


Massachusetts and Limerick, Ireland. We also operate test
    facilities located in the Philippines and use third-party
    subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products.

Capital spending was approximately $123.0 million in fiscal
    2011, compared with approximately $111.6 million in fiscal
    2010. We currently plan to make capital expenditures in the
    range of approximately $100 million to $125 million in
    fiscal 2012.

Our products require a wide variety of components, raw materials
    and external foundry services, most of which we purchase from
    third-party suppliers. We have multiple sources for many of the
    components and materials that we purchase and incorporate into
    our products. However, a large portion of our external wafer
    purchases and foundry services are from a limited number of
    suppliers, primarily TSMC. If TSMC or any of our other key
    suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver
    sufficient quantities of components to us, on the time schedule
    and of the quality that we require, we may be forced to seek to
    engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result
    in significant expenses and disruptions or delays in
    manufacturing, product development and shipment of product to
    our customers. Although we have experienced shortages of
    components, materials and external foundry services from time to
    time, these items have generally been available to us as needed.

Backlog

Backlog at the end of fiscal 2011 was approximately
    $379 million, down from approximately $563 million at
    the end of fiscal 2010. We define backlog as of a particular
    date to mean firm orders from a customer or distributor with a
    requested delivery date within thirteen weeks. Backlog is
    impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead
    times available from suppliers, including us, in periods of
    depressed demand. In periods of increased demand, there is a
    tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of
    increasing backlog and, in some instances, we may not have
    manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders. As is
    customary in the semiconductor industry, we allow most orders to
    be cancelled or deliveries to be delayed by customers without
    significant penalty. Accordingly, we believe that our backlog at
    any time should not be used as an indication of our future
    revenue.

We typically do not have long-term sales contracts with our
    customers. In some of our markets where end-user demand may be
    particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers
    place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it
    available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to
    make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the
    product. In other instances, we manufacture product based on
    forecasts of customer demand. As a result, we may incur
    inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated
    sales and are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders
    leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. Further,
    those orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the
    customer’s unique requirements so that those cancelled
    orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable
    products, resulting in potential inventory write-offs. As a
    result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for some of our products
    that are subject to these uncertainties, the amount of
    unsaleable product could be substantial.

Government
    Contracts

We estimate that approximately 3% of our fiscal 2011 revenue was
    attributable to sales to the U.S. government and
    U.S. government contractors and subcontractors. Our
    government contract business is predominantly in the form of
    negotiated, firm, fixed-price subcontracts. Most of these
    contracts and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating
    to termination at the election of the U.S. government.

Acquisitions,
    Divestitures and Investments

An element of our business strategy involves expansion through
    the acquisition of businesses, assets, products or technologies
    that allow us to complement our existing product offerings,
    expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce
    or enhance our technological capabilities. From time to time, we
    consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen our
    business.

Additional information relating to our acquisition and
    divestiture activities during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 is set
    forth in Note 2u and Note 6 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.


Competition

We believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for
    signal processing products depends upon multiple factors,
    including technological innovation, strength of brand, diversity
    of product portfolio, product performance, technical support,
    delivery capabilities, customer service quality, reliability and
    price, with the relative importance of these factors varying
    among products, markets, and customers.

We compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets
    that are highly competitive. Our competitors include but are not
    limited to:

• Broadcom Corporation

• Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.

• Cirrus Logic, Inc.

• Microchip Technology, Inc.

• Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.

• NXP Semiconductors

• Infineon Technologies

• ST Microelectronics

• Intersil Corporation

• Silicon Laboratories, Inc.

• Knowles Electronics

• Texas Instruments, Inc.

• Linear Technology Corporation

We believe that our technical innovation emphasizing product
    performance and reliability, supported by our commitment to
    strong customer service and technical support, enables us to
    make a fundamental difference to our customers’
    competiveness in our chosen markets.

Environment,
    Health and Safety

We are committed to protecting the environment and the health
    and safety of our employees, customers and the public. We
    endeavor to adhere to applicable environmental, health and
    safety (EHS) regulatory and industry standards across all of our
    facilities, and to encourage pollution prevention, reduce our
    water and energy consumption, reduce waste generation, and
    strive towards continual improvement. We strive to achieve
    excellence in EHS management practices as an integral part of
    our total quality management system.

Our management systems are certified to ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001,
    ISO 9001 and TS16949. We are a member of the Electronic Industry
    Citizenship Coalition, (EICC). Our Sustainability Report, first
    published in 2009, states our commitment to consuming less
    energy and applying fair labor standards, among other things. We
    are not including the information contained in our
    Sustainability Report in, or incorporating it by reference into
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous and
    increasingly strict federal, state local and foreign EHS laws
    and regulations, particularly with respect to the
    transportation, storage, handling, use, emission, discharge and
    disposal of certain chemicals used or produced in the
    semiconductor manufacturing process. Our products are subject to
    increasingly stringent regulations regarding chemical content in
    jurisdictions where we sell products, including the Restriction
    of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) directive in the European Union
    and China and the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and
    Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) directive in the European
    Union. Contracts with many of our customers reflect these and
    additional EHS compliance standards. Compliance with these laws
    and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital
    expenditures, earnings, financial condition or competitive
    position. There can be no assurance, however, that current or
    future environmental laws and regulations will not impose costly
    requirements upon us. Any failure by us to comply with
    applicable environmental laws, regulations and contractual
    obligations could result in fines, suspension of production, the
    need to alter manufacturing processes and legal liability.

Employees

As of October 29, 2011, we employed approximately 9,200
    individuals worldwide. Our future success depends in large part
    on the continued service of our key technical and senior
    management personnel, and on our ability to continue to attract,
    retain and motivate qualified employees, particularly those
    highly-skilled design, process, test and applications engineers
    involved in the design, support and manufacture of new and
    existing products and processes. We believe that relations with
    our employees are good; however, the competition for such
    personnel is intense, and the loss of key personnel could have a
    material adverse impact on our results of operations and
    financial condition.


ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other
    documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and
    uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ
    materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking
    statements contained in this report.

Disruptions
    in global credit and financial markets could materially and
    adversely affect our business and results of
    operations.

There is significant uncertainty about the stability of global
    credit and financial markets. These economic uncertainties
    affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it
    difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business
    activities. High unemployment rates, weakness in commercial and
    residential real estate markets and the tightening of credit by
    financial institutions may lead consumers and businesses to
    postpone spending, which may cause our customers to cancel,
    decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our
    products. In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our
    suppliers or distributors could result in product delays,
    increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges.
    Financial turmoil may cause financial institutions to
    consolidate or go out of business, which increases the risk that
    the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial
    instruments could differ significantly from the fair value
    assigned to them. During the past few years, many governments
    adopted stimulus or spending programs designed to ease the
    economic impact of the crisis. Some of our businesses benefited
    from these stimulus programs and as these programs conclude,
    those businesses could be negatively impacted. The continuing
    debt crisis in certain European countries could cause the value
    of the Euro to deteriorate, thus reducing the purchasing power
    of our European customers. In addition, the recent downgrade of
    the U.S. credit rating and the ongoing European debt crisis
    have contributed to the instability in global credit markets. We
    are unable to predict the impact of these events, and if
    economic conditions deteriorate, we may record additional
    charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of
    assets and our business and results of operations could be
    materially and adversely affected.

Our
    future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income
    are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate.

Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net
    income are difficult to predict and may be materially affected
    by a number of factors, including:

•

the effects of adverse economic conditions in the United States
    and international markets;

•

changes in customer demand for our products and for end products
    that incorporate our products;

•

the effectiveness of our efforts to refocus our operations,
    including our ability to reduce our cost structure in both the
    short term and over a longer duration;

•

the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us,
    our customers or our competitors;

•

competitive pricing pressures;

•

fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of
    wafers and other raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and
    test capacity;

•

the ability of our third party suppliers, subcontractors and
    manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of
    products or components;

•

any significant decline in our backlog;

•

the timing, delay or cancellation of significant customer orders
    and our ability to manage inventory;

•

our ability to hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of
    engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of
    our customers;

•

changes in geographic, product or customer mix;

•

our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient
    levels;


•

potential significant litigation-related costs;

•

the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating
    expense levels, including with respect to costs associated with
    labor, utilities, transportation and raw materials;

•

the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide
    environmental regulations;

•

changes in our effective tax rates in the United States, Ireland
    or worldwide; and

•

the effects of public health emergencies, natural disasters,
    widespread travel disruptions, security risks, terrorist
    activities, international conflicts and other events beyond our
    control.

In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been
    cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and
    downturns. Our business is subject to rapid technological
    changes and there can be no assurance, depending on the mix of
    future business, that products stocked in our inventory will not
    be rendered obsolete before we ship them. As a result of these
    and other factors, there can be no assurance that we will not
    experience material fluctuations in future revenue, gross
    margins, operating results and net income on a quarterly or
    annual basis. In addition, if our revenue, gross margins,
    operating results and net income do not meet the expectations of
    securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common
    stock may decline.

Changes
    in our effective tax rate may impact our results of
    operations.

A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate,
    including: increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions; the
    jurisdictions in which profits are earned and taxed; the
    resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax
    authorities; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets
    and liabilities; adjustments to income taxes upon finalization
    of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for
    tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process
    research and development and impairments of goodwill in
    connection with acquisitions; the lack of sufficient excess tax
    benefits (credits) in our additional paid in capital (APIC) pool
    in situations where our realized tax deductions for certain
    stock-based compensation awards are less than those originally
    anticipated; changes in available tax credits; and changes in
    tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws. Any significant
    increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely
    impact our net income for future periods.

Long-term
    contracts are not typical for us and reductions, cancellations
    or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our
    operating results.

We typically do not have long-term sales contracts with our
    customers. In certain markets where end-user demand may be
    particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers
    place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it
    available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to
    make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the
    product. In other instances, we manufacture product based on
    forecasts of customer demands. As a result, we may incur
    inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated
    sales and are subject to the risk of cancellations of orders,
    leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. Further,
    orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the
    customer’s unique requirements so that those cancelled or
    unrealized orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of
    unsaleable products, causing potential inventory write-offs. As
    a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the
    products that are subject to these uncertainties, the amount of
    unsaleable product could be substantial. Incorrect forecasts, or
    reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products
    could adversely affect our operating results.

Our
    future success depends upon our ability to continue to innovate,
    improve our products, develop and market new products, and
    identify and enter new markets.

Our success significantly depends on our continued ability to
    improve our products and develop and market innovative new
    products. Product development, innovation and enhancement is
    often a complex, time-consuming and costly process involving
    significant investment in research and development, with no
    assurance of return on investment. There can be no assurance
    that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved
    products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and
    improved products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance.
    Our products generally must conform to various evolving and
    sometimes competing industry standards, which may adversely
    affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us
    to incur significant costs. In addition, our


customers generally impose very high quality and reliability
    standards on our products, which often change and may be
    difficult or costly to satisfy. Any inability to satisfy
    customer quality standards or comply with industry standards and
    technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our
    products and our results of operations. In addition, our growth
    is dependent on our continued ability to identify and penetrate
    new markets where we have limited experience and competition is
    intense. Also, some of our customers in these markets are less
    established, which could subject us to increased credit risk.
    There can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in
    the future, that our existing and new products will meet the
    requirements of these markets, that our products will achieve
    customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not
    force price reductions or take market share from us, or that we
    can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in
    these markets. Furthermore, a decline in demand in one or
    several of our end-user markets could have a material adverse
    effect on the demand for our products and our results of
    operations.

We may
    not be able to compete successfully in markets within the
    semiconductor industry in the future.

We face intense technological and pricing competition in the
    semiconductor industry, and we expect this competition to
    increase in the future, including from companies located outside
    the United States. Many other companies offer products that
    compete with our products. Some have (or as a result of
    consolidation within the industry may have) greater financial,
    manufacturing, technical, sales and marketing resources than we
    have. Some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply
    or development relationships with our current and potential
    customers or suppliers. Our competitors also include emerging
    companies selling specialized products in markets we serve.
    Competition is generally based on design and quality of
    products, product performance, features and functionality, and
    product pricing, availability and capacity, with the relative
    importance of these factors varying among products, markets and
    customers. Existing or new competitors may develop products or
    technologies that more effectively address the demands of our
    customers and markets with enhanced performance, features and
    functionality, lower power requirements, greater levels of
    integration or lower cost. Increased competition in certain
    markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining
    average selling prices, reduced gross margins and loss of market
    share in those markets. There can be no assurance that we will
    be able to compete successfully in the future against existing
    or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be
    adversely affected by increased competition.

We rely
    on third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers for
    some industry-standard wafers, manufacturing processes and
    assembly and test services, and generally cannot control their
    availability or conditions of supply.

We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on suppliers, assembly
    and test subcontractors, and third-party wafer fabricators to
    supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using
    industry-standard submicron processes. This reliance involves
    several risks, including reduced control over availability,
    capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields,
    and costs. Additionally, we utilize a limited number of
    third-party wafer fabricators, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor
    Manufacturing Company, or TSMC. In addition, these suppliers
    often provide manufacturing services to our competitors and
    therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in
    capacity constraints. In certain instances, the third party
    supplier is the sole source of highly specialized processing
    services. If our suppliers are unable or unwilling to
    manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule
    and of the quality or quantity that we require or provide us
    with required manufacturing processes, we may be forced to seek
    to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could
    result in additional expenses and delays in product development
    or shipment of product to our customers. If replacement
    suppliers or manufacturing processes are not available, we may
    also experience delays in product development or shipment which
    could, in turn, result in the temporary or permanent loss of
    customers. A significant portion of our revenue for fiscal 2011
    was from products fabricated at third-party wafer-fabrication
    facilities, primarily TSMC.

The
    markets for semiconductor products are cyclical, and increased
    production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices, and
    conversely, we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for
    our products.

The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted
    in periods when demand for our products has increased or
    decreased rapidly. If we expand our operations and workforce too
    rapidly or procure excessive


resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products,
    and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we
    expect or declines, or if we overbuild inventory in a period of
    decreased demand, our operating results may be adversely
    affected as a result of increased operating expenses, reduced
    margins, underutilization of capacity or asset impairment
    charges. These capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor
    manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target
    markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely
    impact our operating results. Conversely, during periods of
    rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be
    sufficient to satisfy the demand. In addition, we may not be
    able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently
    timely manner, procure adequate resources, or locate suitable
    third-party suppliers, to respond effectively to changes in
    demand for our existing products or to the demand for new
    products requested by our customers, and our current or future
    business could be materially and adversely affected.

Our
    semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to
    product warranty and indemnity claims, which could result in
    significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely
    affect the market acceptance of our products.

Semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain
    defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are
    developed. We generally warrant our products to our customers
    for one year from the date title passes from us. We invest
    significant resources in the testing of our products; however,
    if any of our products contain defects, we may be required to
    incur additional development and remediation costs, pursuant to
    warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer
    contracts and purchase orders. These problems may divert our
    technical and other resources from other product development
    efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers
    or others, including liability for costs associated with product
    recalls, which may adversely impact our operating results. We
    may also be subject to customer indemnity claims. Our customers
    have on occasion been sued, and may in the future be sued, by
    third parties with respect to infringement or other product
    matters, and those customers may seek indemnification from us
    under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them.
    In certain cases, our potential indemnification liability may be
    significant. If any of our products contains defects, or has
    reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation
    may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to
    sell our products to existing and prospective customers and
    could adversely affect our operating results.

We have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial
    amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits
    is a highly complex and precise process. Minute impurities,
    contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in
    the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer
    manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer
    breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of
    wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be
    nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in
    semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes
    could become unstable. This instability could result in
    manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a
    material adverse effect on our operating results.

We are
    involved in frequent litigation, including regarding
    intellectual property rights, which could be costly to bring or
    defend and could require us to redesign products or pay
    significant royalties.

The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims
    and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property
    rights, including claims arising under our contractual
    obligations to indemnify our customers. Other companies or
    individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of
    semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to
    obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from
    making and selling infringing products, if those patents are
    found to be valid. From time to time, we receive claims from
    third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe
    their patents or other intellectual property rights. In the
    event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim
    against us and a license is not available to us on commercially
    reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to
    redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that
    intellectual property, and our operating results could be
    materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary
    to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property
    rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this
    litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key
    personnel. We could be subject to warranty or product liability
    claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we
    defend those claims or pay damage awards. There can be no
    assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all
    claims and


potential liabilities. We may incur costs and expenses relating
    to a recall of our customers’ products due to an alleged
    failure of components we supply. An adverse outcome in
    litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial
    position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period
    in which the litigation is resolved.

We may be
    unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which may
    limit our ability to compete effectively.

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our
    intellectual property. We primarily rely on patent, mask work,
    copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as
    nondisclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our
    proprietary technologies and processes. Despite our efforts to
    protect our proprietary technologies and processes, it is
    possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties
    may obtain, copy, use or disclose our technologies, products and
    processes. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we
    design, manufacture, market and sell our products may afford
    little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology.

There can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued
    patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In
    addition, any of our existing or future patents may be
    challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As such, any rights
    granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful
    protection. We may not have foreign patents or pending
    applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and
    applications. Even if foreign patents are granted, effective
    enforcement in foreign countries may not be available. If our
    patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology,
    our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours.
    Our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology
    independently or design around our patents.

We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our
    employees, consultants and strategic partners. We also try to
    control access to and distribution of our technologies,
    documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these
    efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy,
    disclose, obtain or use our products or technology without our
    authorization. Also, former employees may seek employment with
    our business partners, customers or competitors, and there can
    be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary
    information will be maintained in the course of such future
    employment.

We may be
    subject to network disruptions or security breaches that could
    damage our reputation and harm our business and operating
    results.

We may be subject to network disruptions or security breaches
    caused by computer viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking,
    sabotage, acts of vandalism by third parties or terrorism. Our
    security measures or those of our third party service providers
    may not detect or prevent such security breaches. Any such
    compromise of our information security could result in the
    unauthorized publication of our confidential business or
    proprietary information, cause an interruption in our
    operations, result in the unauthorized release of customer or
    employee data, result in a violation of privacy or other laws,
    expose us to a risk of litigation or damage our reputation,
    which could harm our business and operating results.

If we do
    not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our
    business strategy will be adversely affected.

Our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the
    recruitment, retention and effective succession of our executive
    officers and key management and technical personnel,
    particularly our experienced engineers. The competition for
    these employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or
    more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect
    on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material
    adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for
    engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if
    we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do
    not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our
    officers or employees.

To remain
    competitive, we may need to acquire other companies, purchase or
    license technology from third parties, or enter into other
    strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or
    enhance our existing products.

An element of our business strategy involves expansion through
    the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies
    that allow us to complement our existing product offerings,
    expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce
    or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to
    find businesses that


have the technology or resources we need and, if we find such
    businesses, we may not be able to purchase or license the
    technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at
    all. Acquisitions and technology licenses are difficult to
    identify and complete for a number of reasons, including the
    cost of potential transactions, competition among prospective
    buyers and licensees, the need for regulatory approvals, and
    difficulties related to integration efforts. Both in the
    U.S. and abroad, governmental regulation of acquisitions
    has become more complex, increasing the costs and risks of
    undertaking significant acquisitions. In order to finance a
    potential transaction, we may need to raise additional funds by
    issuing securities or borrowing money. We may not be able to
    find financing on favorable terms, and the sale of our stock may
    result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the
    issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the
    rights of our common shareholders.

Acquisitions also involve a number of risks, including:

•

difficulty integrating acquired technologies, operations and
    personnel with our existing businesses;

•

diversion of management attention in connection with both
    negotiating the acquisitions and integrating the assets;

•

strain on managerial and operational resources as management
    tries to oversee larger operations;

•

the future funding requirements for acquired companies, which
    may be significant;

•

potential loss of key employees;

•

exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired
    companies; and

•

increased risk of costly and time-consuming litigation.

If we are unable to successfully address these risks, we may not
    realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition,
    which may have an adverse effect on our business plans and
    operating results.

We rely
    on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable
    areas, which could affect the availability of supplies and
    services.

We, like many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on
    internal manufacturing capacity, wafer fabrication foundries and
    other

sub-contractors

in geologically unstable locations around the world. This
    reliance involves risks associated with the impact of
    earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry, including
    temporary loss of capacity, availability and cost of key raw
    materials, utilities and equipment and availability of key
    services, including transport of our products worldwide. For
    example, in March 2011, a severe earthquake and tsunami hit
    Japan, which together with resulting damage to certain nuclear
    power plants created widespread destruction and economic
    uncertainty in that region. Japan represented approximately 13%
    of our revenue in fiscal 2011. Any prolonged inability to
    utilize one of our manufacturing facilities, or those of our
    subcontractors or third-party wafer fabrication foundries, as a
    result of fire, natural disaster, unavailability of utilities or
    otherwise, could result in a temporary or permanent loss of
    customers for affected products, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
    condition.

We are
    exposed to business, economic, political, legal and other risks
    through our significant worldwide operations.

We have significant operations and manufacturing facilities
    outside the United States, including in Ireland and the
    Philippines. During fiscal 2011, we derived approximately 82% of
    our revenue from customers in international markets. Although we
    engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to
    currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance
    that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by
    changes in the exchange rate of the United States dollar against
    other currencies. Potential interest rate increases, as well as
    high energy costs, could have an adverse impact on industrial
    and consumer spending patterns and could adversely impact demand
    for our products. At October 29, 2011, our principal source
    of liquidity was $3,592.5 million of cash and cash
    equivalents and short-term investments. As of October 29,
    2011, approximately $1,170.5 million of our cash and cash
    equivalents and short-term investments was held in the United
    States and the remaining balance was held outside the United
    States in various foreign subsidiaries. As we intend to reinvest
    certain of our foreign


earnings indefinitely, this cash held outside the United States
    is not readily available to meet certain of our cash
    requirements in the United States. We require a substantial
    amount of cash in the United States for operating requirements,
    stock repurchases, cash dividends and acquisitions. If we are
    unable to address our U.S. cash requirements through
    operations, through borrowings under our current credit facility
    or from other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost, it
    may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings
    that are permanently reinvested, and we may be required to pay
    additional taxes under current tax laws, which could have a
    material effect on our results of operations and financial
    condition.

In addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in
    the semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic,
    political and legal risks inherent in international operations,
    including the risks associated with the recent crisis in global
    credit and financial markets, ongoing uncertainties and
    political and economic instability in many countries around the
    world, as well as economic disruption from acts of terrorism and
    the response to them by the United States and its allies. Other
    business risks associated with global operations include
    increased managerial complexities, air transportation
    disruptions, expropriation, currency controls, currency exchange
    rate movement, additional costs related to foreign taxes,
    tariffs and freight rate increases, exposure to different
    business practices and legal standards, particularly with
    respect to price protection, competition practices, intellectual
    property, anti-corruption and environmental compliance, trade
    and travel restrictions, pandemics, import and export license
    requirements and restrictions, difficulties in staffing and
    managing worldwide operations, and accounts receivable
    collections.

We expect to continue to expand our business and operations in
    China. Our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely
    affected by China’s continuously evolving laws and
    regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and
    export tariffs, currency controls, environmental regulations,
    and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those
    rights. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be
    inconsistent. In addition, changes in the political environment,
    governmental policies or

U.S.-China

relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or
    their interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our
    proprietary intellectual property, increased taxation,
    restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations,
    which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and
    operating results.

Our
    operating results are dependent on the performance of
    independent distributors.

A significant portion of our sales are through independent
    distributors that are not under our control. These independent
    distributors generally represent product lines offered by
    several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts
    applied to our products or they could terminate their
    representation of us. We generally do not require letters of
    credit from our distributors and are not protected against
    accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by
    these distributors. Our inability to collect open accounts
    receivable could adversely affect our operating results.
    Termination of a significant distributor, whether at our
    initiative or the distributor’s initiative, could disrupt
    our current business, and if we are unable to find suitable
    replacements, our operating results could be adversely affected.

We are
    subject to increasingly strict environmental health and safety
    (EHS) regulations, which could increase our expenses and affect
    our operating results.

Our industry is subject to increasingly strict EHS requirements,
    particularly those environmental requirements that control and
    restrict the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage
    and disposal of certain chemicals used or produced in the
    semiconductor manufacturing process. Public attention to
    environmental concerns continues to increase, and our customers
    routinely include stringent environmental standards in their
    contracts with us. Changes in environmental laws or regulations
    may require us to invest in costly equipment or alter the way
    our products are made. In addition, we use hazardous and other
    regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability
    for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such
    materials. Any failure to control such materials adequately or
    to comply with statutory or regulatory standards or contractual
    obligations could result in liability for damages, penalties,
    and civil and criminal fines, and might damage our reputation,
    increase our expenses, and adversely affect our operating
    results.


New climate change laws and regulations could require us to
    change our manufacturing processes or obtain substitute
    materials that may cost more or be less available for our
    manufacturing operations. In addition, new restrictions on
    emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases could
    result in significant costs for us. The Commonwealth of
    Massachusetts has adopted greenhouse gas regulations, and the
    U.S. Congress may pass federal greenhouse gas legislation
    in the future. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
    (EPA) has issued greenhouse gas reporting regulations that may
    apply to certain of our operations. EPA is developing other
    climate change-based regulations, as are certain states, that
    also may increase our expenses and adversely affect our
    operating results. We expect increased worldwide regulatory
    activity relating to climate change in the future. Compliance
    with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on
    our capital expenditures, earnings, financial condition or
    competitive position. There is no assurance that the cost to
    comply with current or future EHS laws and regulations will not
    exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition
    or results of operations. Additionally, any failure by us to
    comply with applicable EHS requirements or contractual
    obligations could result in penalties, civil and criminal fines,
    suspension of or changes to production, legal liability and
    damage to our reputation.

If we are
    unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we may not be able to
    service our debt obligations, including making payments on our
    two issuances of $375 million senior unsecured notes or our
    $145 million term loan facility.

In fiscal 2009, we issued in a public offering $375 million
    aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notes
    due July 1, 2014. In April 2011, we issued in a public
    offering $375 million aggregate principal amount of
    3.0% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2016. In
    December 2010, Analog Devices Holdings B.V., a wholly owned
    subsidiary of ours, entered into a $145 million term loan
    facility which matures on December 22, 2013. Our ability to
    make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when
    due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject
    to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial,
    business and other factors affecting our consolidated
    operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are
    unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the
    future to service our debt, we may be required to, among other
    things:

•

seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;

•

refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness,
    including the notes;

•

sell selected assets;

•

reduce or delay planned capital expenditures; or

•

reduce or delay planned operating expenditures.

Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service
    our debt, including the notes or our term loan facility, which
    could negatively impact our financial results. In addition, any
    such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be
    possible on economically favorable terms.

Restrictions
    in our revolving credit and term loan facilities and outstanding
    debt instruments may limit our activities.

Our current revolving credit and term loan facilities and our
    5.0% and 3.0% senior unsecured notes impose, and future
    debt instruments to which we may become subject, may impose
    restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that
    could otherwise benefit our company, including to undertake
    certain transactions, to create certain liens on our assets and
    to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. Our ability to comply
    with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on
    our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic
    conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond
    our control such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates,
    changes in technology and changes in the level of competition.
    In addition, our credit and term loan facilities require us to
    maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. If we
    breach any of the covenants under our credit or term loan
    facilities or the indenture governing our outstanding notes and
    do not obtain appropriate waivers, then, subject to applicable
    cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be
    declared immediately due and payable.


Our stock
    price may be volatile.

The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the
    past and may be volatile in the future, as it may be
    significantly affected by the following factors:

•

crises in global credit, debt and financial markets;

•

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating
    results;

•

changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our
    failure to perform in line with those estimates or our published
    guidance;

•

changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies;

•

announcements by us or our competitors of significant new
    products, technical innovations, acquisitions or dispositions,
    litigation or capital commitments;

•

departures of key personnel;

•

actual or perceived noncompliance with corporate responsibility
    or ethics standards by us or any of our employees, officers or
    directors; and

•

negative media publicity targeting us or our competitors.

The stock market has historically experienced volatility,
    especially within the semiconductor industry, that often has
    been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. These
    market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless
    of our operating results.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, on November 18,
    2011, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.25
    per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid
    on December 21, 2011 to all shareholders of record at the
    close of business on December 2, 2011. The payment of
    future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors
    including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity.

The

year-to-year

revenue changes by end market and product category are more

Revenue Trends by End Market

and

Revenue Trends by Product

.

During fiscal 2011, our revenue increased 8%, as compared to
    fiscal 2010. Our diluted earnings per share from continuing
    operations increased to $2.79 in fiscal 2011 from $2.33 in
    fiscal 2010. Cash flow from operations in fiscal 2011 was
    $900.5 million or 30% of revenue. We received proceeds of
    $515.5 million during fiscal 2011 from the issuance of
    $375 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior
    unsecured notes and from a $145 million term loan facility
    entered into by a wholly owned subsidiary of ours. In addition,
    we received $217.2 million in net proceeds from employee
    stock option exercises. During fiscal 2011, we repurchased a
    total of approximately 9.0 million shares of our common
    stock for an aggregate of $330.3 million, distributed
    $281.6 million to our shareholders in dividend payments and
    paid $123.0 million for property, plant and equipment
    additions. These factors contributed to the net increase in cash
    and cash equivalents of $335.1 million in fiscal 2011.

The

year-to-year

increase in revenue and profitability for fiscal 2011 was
    primarily the result of improved global macro-economic
    conditions during the first half of the fiscal year. The strong
    growth we experienced in the first six months of fiscal 2011,
    including a 9% sequential revenue increase in our second fiscal
    quarter, was followed by sequential revenue declines in both the
    third and fourth fiscal quarters. The 9% sequential revenue
    increase in the second fiscal quarter included increased
    inventory stocking by our customers as a result of the Japanese
    earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. During the third and
    fourth quarters, of fiscal 2011, we began to see revenue
    declines attributable to inventory corrections following the
    inventory buildup in the prior quarters and declining demand as
    the deficit and credit related crisis in Europe and the
    U.S. caused customers to become more cautious in the second
    half of fiscal 2011.

Revenue
    Trends by End Market

The following table summarizes revenue by end market. The
    categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a
    variety of data points including the technical characteristics
    of the product, the “sold to” customer information,
    the “ship to” customer information and the end
    customer product or application into which our product will be
    incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this
    data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end
    market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify
    revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications
    typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the
    underlying trends of results within, each end market. During
    fiscal year 2011, we consolidated the computer end market, which
    represented approximately 1% of fiscal 2011 revenue, into the
    consumer end market, and reclassified handset


revenue, which represented approximately 3% of fiscal 2011
    revenue, from the communications end market to the consumer end
    market for all periods presented.

Industrial —

The

year-to-year

increase in revenue from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 in
    industrial end market revenue was primarily the result of a
    broad-based increase in demand in this end market, which was
    most significant for products sold into the automation and
    instrumentation sectors and, to a lesser extent, products sold
    into the energy and healthcare sectors. The

    automation sectors.

Automotive

— The

year-to-year

increase in revenue from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 in
    automotive end market revenue was primarily the result of a
    general increase in the electronic content found in vehicles
    and, to a lesser extent, a general increase in demand by our
    customers. The

year-to-year

increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in
    automotive end market revenue was primarily the result of
    increased demand due to various government-initiated incentive
    programs, inventory replenishment and a general increase in the
    electronic content found in vehicles.

Consumer —

The

year-to-year

decrease in revenue from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 in consumer
    end market revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in
    demand for products in the digital camera and home entertainment
    sector primarily as a result of the impact of the earthquake and
    tsunami that occurred in Japan in March 2011, partially offset
    by an increase in demand for products used in portable devices
    in this end market. The

year-to-year

increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in consumer
    end market revenue was primarily the result of a broad-based
    increase in demand for products used in digital cameras and
    other consumer applications.

Communications —

The

year-to-year

increase in revenue from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 in
    communications end market revenue was primarily the result of a
    broad-based increase in demand in this end market, which was
    most significant for the basestation end market sector. The

year-to-year

increase in revenue from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 in
    communications end market revenue was primarily the result of a
    broad-based increase in demand in this end market, which was
    most significant for the infrastructure sector.


Revenue
    Trends by Product

The following table summarizes revenue by product categories.
    The categorization of our products into broad categories is
    based on the characteristics of the individual products, the
    specification of the products and in some cases the specific
    uses that certain products have within applications. The
    categorization of products into categories is therefore subject
    to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances
    where products move between product categories we reclassify the
    amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such
    reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing
    of, or the underlying trends of results within, each product
    category.

    Canada and Mexico; the predominant countries comprising
    “Europe” are Germany, Sweden, France and the United
    Kingdom; and the predominant countries comprising “Rest of
    Asia” are Taiwan and South Korea.

Sales increased in all geographic regions, except Japan, in
    fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily as a result of
    increases in sales activity in the industrial, automotive and
    communications end market sectors. The

year-to-year

decrease in sales in Japan was primarily the result of lower
    sales activity in the consumer end market sector in this region
    due to the earthquake and tsunami that occurred in Japan in
    March 2011.


Sales increased in all geographic regions in fiscal 2010 as
    compared to fiscal 2009, with sales in Europe and the Rest of
    Asia experiencing the largest increases. The increase in sales
    was the result of an increase in demand for our products
    primarily as a result of improving economic conditions worldwide.

    of efforts to reduce overall manufacturing costs, including the
    savings realized as a result of our wafer fabrication
    consolidation actions. Additionally, a higher proportion of our
    revenues were from products sold into the instrumentation and
    automation sectors of the industrial end market, which earn
    higher margins as compared to products sold into our other end
    markets.

Gross margin percentage was higher in fiscal 2010 by
    970 basis points as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily as a
    result of an increase in sales of $746.6 million, increased

%

R&D expenses increased $13.3 million, or 3%, in fiscal
    2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily the
    result of higher employee salary and benefit expense due to
    salary increases that were effective at the beginning of the
    second quarter of fiscal 2011, increased headcount, and a
    general increase in spending. These increases were partially
    offset by lower variable compensation expense, which is a
    variable expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue
    growth.

Research and development, or R&D, expenses in fiscal 2010
    increased $45.3 million, or 10%, from fiscal 2009. The
    increase was primarily the result of an increase in variable
    compensation expense, which was a variable expense linked to our
    overall profitability, partially offset by the impact of actions
    we took over the prior two years to control discretionary
    spending and permanently reduce operating expenses.

R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from

year-to-year

depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new
    product development efforts, which we view as critical to our
    future growth. At any point in time we have hundreds of R&D
    projects underway, and we believe that none of these projects is
    material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the
    development of innovative technologies and processes for new
    products, and we believe that a continued commitment to R&D
    is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our
    existing products and to provide innovative new product
    offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make
    significant R&D investments in the future.

    variable expense linked to our overall profitability, and higher
    sales commission expenses, which are variable expenses linked to
    our sales. These increases were offset by the impact of actions

Special
    Charges

Closure
    of Wafer Fabrication Facility in Sunnyvale

We ceased production at our California wafer fabrication
    facility in November 2006. We paid the related lease obligation
    costs on a monthly basis over the remaining lease term, which
    expired in March 2010. We recorded a one-time settlement charge
    of $0.4 million in fiscal 2010 related to the termination
    of the lease. This action was completed during fiscal 2010.

Consolidation
    of a Wafer Fabrication Facility in Limerick

During fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2010, we recorded special
    charges of $16.4 million as a result of our decision to
    only use eight-inch technology at our wafer fabrication facility
    in Limerick. These special charges included $14.9 million
    for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our
    ongoing benefit plan for 150 manufacturing employees and
    $1.5 million for

clean-up

and
    closure costs that we expensed as incurred. The production in
    the six-inch wafer fabrication facility ceased during the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2009. This action was completed during fiscal
    2010. This action resulted in annual cost savings of
    approximately $25 million per year.

Reduction
    of Operating Costs

During fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2010, in order to further
    reduce our operating cost structure, we recorded special charges
    of approximately $43.3 million. These special charges
    included: $39.1 million for severance and fringe benefit
    costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory
    requirements at foreign locations for 245 manufacturing
    employees and 470 engineering and SMG&A employees;
    $2.1 million for lease obligation costs for facilities that
    we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal 2009;
    $0.8 million for the write-off of property, plant and
    equipment; $0.5 million for contract termination costs;
    $0.3 million for

clean-up

and
    closure costs that we expensed as incurred; and
    $0.5 million related to the impairment of intellectual
    property. This action resulted in annual cost savings of
    approximately $52 million per year. We terminated the
    employment of all employees associated with this action and we
    are paying amounts owed to them as income continuance.

During fiscal 2011, in order to further reduce our operating
    cost structure, we recorded a special charge of approximately
    $2.2 million. This special charge was for severance and
    fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan
    or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 25
    engineering and SMG&A employees. As of October 29,
    2011, we still employed 13 of the 25 employees included in
    this cost reduction action. These employees must continue to be
    employed by us until their employment is involuntarily
    terminated in order to receive the severance benefit. We
    estimate this action will result in annual savings in SMG&A
    expenses of approximately $4 million once fully implemented.


Closure
    of a Wafer Fabrication Facility in Cambridge

During fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010, we recorded special charges
    of $26.8 million as a result of our decision to consolidate
    our Cambridge, Massachusetts wafer fabrication facility into our
    existing Wilmington, Massachusetts facility. These special
    charges included: $7.4 million for severance and fringe
    benefit costs recorded in accordance with our ongoing benefit
    plan for 124 manufacturing employees and 9 SMG&A employees;
    $14.6 million for the impairment of manufacturing assets;
    $3.4 million for lease obligation costs for the Cambridge
    wafer fabrication facility, which we ceased using in the first
    quarter of fiscal 2010; and $1.4 million for

clean-up

and
    closure costs that we expensed as incurred. This action was
    completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2011. This action
    resulted in annual cost savings of approximately
    $43 million per year.

The $172.0 million, or 19%, increase in operating income
    from continuing operations in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal
    2010 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue of
    $231.8 million and a 120 basis point increase in gross
    margin percentage.

The $615.3 million, or 216%, increase in operating income
    from continuing operations in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal
    2009 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue of
    $746.6 million, a 970 basis point increase in gross
    margin percentage, and lower special charges recorded in fiscal
    2010 as compared to fiscal 2009.

Nonoperating (income) expense was higher by $12.2 million
    in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was
    primarily due to an increase in interest expense incurred as a
    result of the issuance of $375 million aggregate principal
    amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes on April 4,
    2011, and the $145 million term loan facility entered into
    by a wholly owned subsidiary of ours in December 2010. In
    addition, we earned lower interest income as a result of lower
    interest rates in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, which
    was partially offset by interest earned on higher cash balances
    in fiscal 2011.

Nonoperating income was lower by $11 million in fiscal 2010
    as compared to fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily due to
    higher interest expense incurred during fiscal 2010 as a result
    of the issuance of $375 million aggregate principal
    5.0% senior unsecured notes on June 30, 2009,
    resulting in a partial year of interest expense in 2009 compared
    to a full year in 2010. In addition, we earned lower interest
    income on investments as a result of lower interest rates in
    fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009.

Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in

    our income is earned.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was lower by
    220 basis points compared to our effective tax rate for
    fiscal 2010. The tax rate for fiscal 2011 included the following
    items which caused a decrease in our tax rate: the reinstatement
    of the federal R&D tax credit in December 2010 retroactive
    to January 1, 2010, resulting in a $6.0 million income
    tax savings; a $6.7 million reduction in the state tax
    credit valuation reserve that we believe we can now recover; a
    $0.5 million tax benefit from the increase in Irish
    deferred taxes as a result of the increase in the Irish
    manufacturing tax rate from 10% to 12.5%; and a net
    $10.8 million tax benefit related to the settlement with
    the Appeals Office of the Internal Revenue Service of certain
    tax matters for the fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2007 tax years.
    Fiscal 2010 also included a higher special charge, a majority of
    which provided a tax benefit at the higher U.S. tax rate as
    compared to the special charge recorded in fiscal 2011.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was higher compared to
    our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of
    a change in the mix of our income to jurisdictions where income
    is taxed at a higher rate. In addition, higher special charges
    recorded in fiscal 2009, a majority of which provided a tax
    benefit at the higher U.S. tax rate, contributed to a
    higher effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal
    2009.

Net income from continuing operations in fiscal 2011 was higher
    than in fiscal 2010 by approximately $149.7 million
    primarily as a result of the $172.0 million increase in
    operating income from continuing operations, offset by lower
    nonoperating income and a higher provision for income taxes in
    fiscal 2011 than in fiscal 2010.

Income from continuing operations, net of tax, in fiscal 2010
    was higher than in fiscal 2009 by approximately
    $463.8 million primarily as a result of the
    $615.3 million increase in operating income that was
    partially offset by a higher provision for income taxes in
    fiscal 2010.

The impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate
    movement on our results of operations during the past three
    fiscal years has not been significant.

We sold our Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc. and our

    certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation during the
    first quarter of fiscal 2008. Accordingly, the results of the
    operations of these businesses have been presented as
    discontinued operations within the consolidated financial
    statements.

Acquisitions

In fiscal 2006, we acquired substantially all the outstanding
    stock of privately-held Integrant Technologies, Inc. (Integrant)
    of Seoul, Korea. The acquisition enabled us to enter the mobile
    TV market and strengthened our


presence in the Asia region. We paid $8.4 million related
    to the purchase of shares from the founder of Integrant during
    the period from July 2007 through July 2009. We recorded these
    payments as additional goodwill.

In fiscal 2006, we acquired all the outstanding stock of
    privately-held AudioAsics A/S (AudioAsics) of Roskilde, Denmark.
    The acquisition of AudioAsics allowed us to continue developing
    low-power audio solutions, while expanding our presence in the
    Nordic and Eastern European regions. We paid additional cash
    payments of $3.1 million during fiscal 2009 for the
    achievement of revenue-based milestones during the period from
    October 2006 through January 2009, which we recorded as
    additional goodwill. In addition, in accordance with the terms
    of the acquisition documents, we paid $3.2 million during
    fiscal 2009 based on the achievement of technological milestones
    during the period from October 2006 through January 2009, which
    we recorded as compensation expense in fiscal 2008. All revenue
    and technological milestones related to this acquisition have
    been met and no additional payments will be made.

In fiscal 2011, we acquired privately-held Lyric Semiconductor,
    Inc. (Lyric) of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The acquisition of
    Lyric gives us the potential to achieve an order of magnitude
    improvement in power efficiency in mixed signal processing. The
    acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred
    totaled $27.8 million, which consisted of
    $14.0 million in initial cash payments at closing and
    contingent consideration of up to $13.8 million. The
    contingent consideration arrangement requires additional cash
    payments to the former equity holders of Lyric upon the
    achievement of certain technological and product development
    milestones payable during the period from June 2011 through June
    2016. As of October 29, 2011, no contingent payments have
    been made and the fair value of the contingent consideration was
    approximately $14.0 million. We allocated the purchase
    price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the
    date of acquisition, resulting in the recognition of
    $12.2 million of in-process research and development,
    $18.9 million of goodwill and $3.3 million of net
    deferred tax liabilities. In addition, we will be obligated to
    pay royalties to the former equity holders of Lyric on revenue
    recognized from the sale of Lyric products and licenses through
    the earlier of 20 years or the accrual of a maximum of
    $25 million. Royalty payments to Lyric employees require
    post-acquisition services to be rendered and, as such, we will
    record these amounts as compensation expense in the related
    periods. As of October 29, 2011, no royalty payments have
    been made. We recognized $0.2 million of acquisition
    related costs that we expensed in the third quarter of fiscal
    2011. These costs are included in operating expenses in the
    consolidated statement of income.

We have not provided pro forma results of operations for
    Integrant, AudioAsics and Lyric in this report as they were not
    material to us on either an individual or an aggregate basis. We
    included the results of operations of each acquisition in our
    consolidated statement of income from the date of such
    acquisition.

At October 29, 2011, cash and cash equivalents totaled
    $1,405.1 million. The primary sources of funds for fiscal
    2011 were net cash generated from operating activities of
    $900.5 million, proceeds of $515.5 million relating to
    the issuance of $375 million aggregate principal amount of
    3.0% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2016 and the
    $145 million term loan facility we entered into through a
    wholly owned subsidiary. In addition, we received
    $217.2 million in net proceeds from employee stock option
    exercises. The principal uses of funds for fiscal 2011 were the
    repurchase of approximately 9 million shares of our common
    stock for an aggregate of $330.3 million,


dividend payments of $281.6 million and additions to
    property, plant and equipment of $123.0 million. These
    factors contributed to the net increase in cash and cash
    equivalents of $335.1 million in fiscal 2011.

We use the annualized fourth quarter revenue in our calculation
    of days sales outstanding and we use the annualized fourth
    quarter cost of sales in our calculation of days cost of sales
    in inventory.

Accounts receivable at October 29, 2011 decreased
    $38.8 million, or 10%, from the end of the fourth quarter
    of fiscal 2010. The decrease in receivables was primarily the
    result of lower revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 as
    compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Days sales
    outstanding decreased by two days as a result of lower product
    shipments in the final month of the fourth quarter of fiscal
    2011 as compared to the final month of the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2010.

Inventory at October 29, 2011 increased by
    $17.6 million, or 6%, from the end of the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2010. The increase in inventory relates primarily to an
    increase in manufacturing production to support the higher
    revenue levels recorded in fiscal 2011. Days cost of sales in
    inventory increased five days primarily due to lower
    manufacturing costs, which resulted in cost of sales increasing
    only 1% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 as compared to
    the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, compared to a 6% increase in
    inventory during this same time period.

Current liabilities decreased to $525.0 million at
    October 29, 2011, a decrease of $118.5 million, or
    18%, from $643.5 million at the end of fiscal 2010. This
    decrease was primarily due to a decrease in income tax payable
    as a result of the settlement with the Appeals Office of the
    Internal Revenue Service of certain tax matters for the fiscal
    2004 through fiscal 2007 tax years. In addition, accrued
    liabilities declined as a result of a decrease in accruals
    related to variable compensation expense.

As of October 29, 2011 and October 30, 2010, we had
    gross deferred revenue of $311.3 million and
    $327.2 million, respectively, and gross deferred cost of
    sales of $78.1 million and $84.4 million,
    respectively. Deferred income on shipments to distributors
    decreased by approximately $9.6 million in fiscal 2011
    primarily as a result of the distributors’ sales to their
    customers in fiscal 2011 exceeding our shipments to our
    distributors during this same time period. Sales to distributors
    are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive
    price-adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for
    credit, as determined by us, in order to reduce the amounts of
    slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their
    inventory. Given the uncertainties associated with the levels of
    price-adjustment credits to be granted to distributors, the
    sales price to the distributors is not fixed or determinable
    until the distributors resell the products to their customers.
    Therefore, we defer revenue recognition from sales to
    distributors until the distributors have sold the products to
    their customers. The amount of price-adjustments is dependent on
    future overall market conditions, and therefore the levels of
    these adjustments could fluctuate significantly from period to
    period. To the extent that we experience a significant increase
    in the amount of credits we issue to our distributors, there
    could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross
    margin recognized relating to these transactions.

Net additions to property, plant and equipment were
    $123.0 million in fiscal 2011 and were funded with a
    combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations.
    We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of
    approximately $100 million to $125 million in fiscal
    2012 to be used primarily in our manufacturing facilities.

During fiscal 2011, our Board of Directors declared cash
    dividends totaling $0.94 per outstanding share of common stock
    resulting in aggregate dividend payments of $281.6 million.
    After the end of fiscal 2011, on November 18, 2011, our
    Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per
    outstanding share of our common stock. The dividend is payable
    on December 21, 2011 to shareholders of record on
    December 2, 2011 and is expected to total approximately
    $75 million. We currently expect quarterly dividends to
    continue at $0.25 per share,


although they remain subject to declaration by our Board of
    Directors. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be
    based on several factors, including our financial performance,
    outlook and liquidity.

Our common stock repurchase program has been in place since
    August 2004. In the aggregate, the Board of Directors has
    authorized us to repurchase $5 billion of our common stock
    under the program. Under the program, we may repurchase
    outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the
    open market and through privately negotiated transactions.
    Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of
    Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have
    repurchased all shares authorized under the program. As of
    October 29, 2011, we had repurchased a total of
    approximately 125.0 million shares of our common stock for
    approximately $4,278.5 million under this program. As of
    October 29, 2011, an additional $721.5 million
    remained available for repurchase of shares under the current
    authorized program. The repurchased shares are held as
    authorized but unissued shares of common stock. We also from
    time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax
    withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock
    or restricted stock units or the exercise of stock options, or
    in certain limited circumstances to satisfy the exercise price
    of options granted to our employees under our equity
    compensation plans. Any future common stock repurchases will be
    based on several factors including our financial performance,
    outlook, liquidity and the amount of cash we have available in
    the United States.

On June 30, 2009, we issued $375 million aggregate
    principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notes due
    July 1, 2014 (the 5.0% Notes) with annual interest
    payments of 5.0% paid in two installments on January 1 and July
    1 of each year, commencing January 1, 2010. The net
    proceeds of the offering were $370.4 million, after issuing
    at a discount and deducting expenses, underwriting discounts and
    commissions, which will be amortized over the term of the
    5.0% Notes. We swapped the fixed interest portion of these
    Notes for a variable interest rate based on the three-month
    LIBOR plus 2.05% (2.42% as of October 29, 2011). The
    variable interest payments based on the variable annual rate are
    payable quarterly. The LIBOR based rate is set quarterly three
    months prior to the date of the interest payment. The indenture
    governing the 5.0% Notes contains covenants that may limit
    our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt for
    borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property;
    enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to a
    principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or
    transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to any
    other party. As of October 29, 2011, we were compliant with
    these covenants.

On December 22, 2010, Analog Devices Holdings B.V., a
    wholly owned subsidiary of ours, entered into a credit agreement
    with Bank of America, N.A., London Branch as administrative
    agent. The borrower’s obligations are guaranteed by us. The
    credit agreement provides for a term loan facility of
    $145 million, which matures on December 22, 2013. The
    terms of the agreement provide for a three-year principal
    amortization schedule with $3.6 million payable quarterly
    every March, June, September and December with the balance
    payable upon the maturity date. During the third quarter of
    fiscal 2011 we made an additional principal payment of
    $17.5 million. The loan will bear interest at a fluctuating
    rate for each period equal to the LIBOR rate corresponding with
    the tenor of the interest period plus a spread of 1.25% (1.61%
    as of October 29, 2011). The terms of this facility include
    limitations on subsidiary indebtedness and on liens against our
    assets and the assets of our subsidiaries, and also include
    financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum
    interest coverage ratio and not exceed a maximum leverage ratio.
    As of October 29, 2011, we were compliant with these
    covenants. The proceeds of this loan are being used to
    restructure our captive finance subsidiaries.

On April 4, 2011, we issued $375 million aggregate
    principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes due
    April 15, 2016 (the 3.0% Notes) with semi-annual fixed
    interest payments due on April 15 and October 15 of each year,
    commencing October 15, 2011. The net proceeds of the
    offering were $370.5 million, after issuing at a discount
    and deducting expenses, underwriting discounts and commissions,
    which will be amortized over the term of the 3.0% Notes.
    The indenture governing the 3.0% Notes contains covenants
    that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or
    guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a
    principal property; enter into sale and lease-back transactions
    with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or
    merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our
    assets to, any other party. As of October 29, 2011, we were
    compliant with these covenants.

In addition, we have a five-year $165 million unsecured
    revolving credit facility that expires in May 2013. To date, we
    have not borrowed under this credit facility but we may borrow
    in the future and use the proceeds for support of commercial
    paper issuance, stock repurchases, dividend payments,
    acquisitions, capital expenditures,


working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. The terms
    of this facility also include financial covenants that require
    us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and not exceed
    a maximum leverage ratio. As of October 29, 2011, we were
    compliant with these covenants.

At October 29, 2011, our principal source of liquidity was
    $3,592.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and
    short-term investments, of which approximately
    $1,170.5 million was held in the United States. The balance
    of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was
    held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries.
    As we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings
    indefinitely, this cash held outside the United States is not
    available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the United
    States, including for cash dividends and common stock
    repurchases. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly
    liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at
    the time of acquisition and our short-term investments consist
    primarily of liquid money market funds and corporate
    obligations, such as commercial paper, bonds and bank time
    deposits. We maintain these balances with high credit quality
    counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit
    exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in
    order to minimize our credit risk.

We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash
    expected to be generated from future operations, together with
    existing and anticipated available long-term financing, will be
    sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research
    and development efforts, dividend payments (if any) and
    repurchases of our stock (if any) under our stock repurchase
    program in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve
    months.

Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is
    consistent with the local requirements of each country. The
    payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected
    contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2012. The actual
    future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the
    table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are
    not practical because of potential future changes in variables,
    such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of
    increase in compensation levels.

Purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other
    goods and services are not included in the table above. We are
    not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders
    that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may
    represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding
    agreements. In addition, our purchase orders generally allow for
    cancellation without significant penalties. We do not have
    significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or
    other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that
    exceed our expected short-term requirements.

Our 2011 acquisition of Lyric Semiconductor involves the
    potential payment of contingent consideration. The table above
    does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts
    are uncertain. See Note 6 in the Notes to our Consolidated
    Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

for more information regarding our acquisitions.

As of October 29, 2011, our total liabilities associated
    with uncertain tax positions was $20.8 million, which are
    included in “Other non-current liabilities” in our
    consolidated balance sheet contained in Item 8 of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties, we
    cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in
    which we expect to settle the non-current liabilities associated
    with these uncertain tax positions. Therefore, we have not
    included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual
    obligations table.

The expected timing of payments and the amounts of the
    obligations discussed above are estimated based on current
    information available as of October 29, 2011.

Off-balance
    Sheet Financing

As of October 29, 2011, we had no off-balance sheet
    financing arrangements.

Outlook

The following statements are based on current expectations.
    These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may
    differ materially. Unless specifically mentioned, these
    statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any
    mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or business combinations
    that may be announced or closed after the date of filing this
    report. These statements supersede all prior statements
    regarding our business outlook made by us.

We are planning for revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2012
    to be down approximately 5% to 10% from the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2011. Our plan is for gross margin percentage for the
    first quarter of fiscal 2012 to be approximately 63.0% plus or
    minus 50 basis points.  We are planning for operating expenses
    in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 to be in the range of $226
    million to $229 million. As a result, our plan is for diluted
    EPS to be approximately $0.44 to $0.51 in the first quarter of
    fiscal 2012.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

Standards
    Implemented

Multiple-Deliverable
    Revenue Arrangements

In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued Accounting Standards Update

No. 2009-13 —

Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue
    Arrangements

(formerly EITF Issue

No. 08-1)

(ASU

No. 2009-13).

This standard modifies the revenue recognition guidance for
    arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple elements,
    such as product, software, services or support, to a customer at
    different


times as part of a single revenue generating transaction. This
    standard provides principles and application guidance to
    determine whether multiple deliverables exist, how the
    individual deliverables should be separated and how to allocate
    the revenue in the arrangement among those separate
    deliverables. The standard also expands the disclosure
    requirements for multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. ASU

No. 2009-13

is effective for fiscal years that begin on or after
    June 15, 2010, which is our fiscal year 2011. The adoption
    of ASU

2009-13

in
    the first quarter of fiscal 2011 did not have a material impact
    on our financial condition and results of operations.

Standards
    to be Implemented

Business
    Combinations

In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2010-29,

Business Combinations (ASC Topic 805) — Disclosure
    of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations

(ASU

No. 2010-29).

ASU No. 2010-29

requires a public entity to disclose revenue and earnings of the
    combined entity as though the business combination that occurred
    during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the
    prior year. It also requires a description of the nature and
    amount of material, nonrecurring adjustments directly
    attributable to the business combination included in the
    reported revenue and earnings. The new disclosure will be
    effective for our first quarter of fiscal year 2012. The
    adoption of ASU

No. 2010-29

will require additional disclosure in the event of a business
    combination but will not have a material impact on our financial
    condition and results of operations.

Intangibles —
    Goodwill and Other

In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2010-28,

Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (ASC Topic 350)

(ASU

No. 2010-28).

ASU

No. 2010-28

modifies Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting
    units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those
    reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the
    goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a
    goodwill impairment exists. In determining whether it is more
    likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, an entity
    should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative
    factors indicating that an impairment may exist. ASU

2010-28

is
    effective for fiscal years that begin after December 15,
    2010, which is our fiscal year 2012. We do not expect the
    adoption of ASU

No. 2010-28

to impact our financial condition and results of operations.

Fair
    Value Measurement

In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2011-04,

Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurements and
    Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs

(ASU

No. 2011-04).

ASU

No. 2011-04

amended ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurements and
    Disclosures

, to converge the fair value measurement guidance
    in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting
    Standards (IFRSs). Some of the amendments clarify the
    application of existing fair value measurement requirements,
    while other amendments change a particular principle in
    ASC 820. In addition, ASU

No. 2011-04

requires additional fair value disclosures. The amendments are
    to be applied prospectively and are effective for interim and
    annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, which is
    our second quarter of fiscal year 2012. We are currently
    evaluating the impact, if any, that ASU

No. 2011-04

may have on our financial condition and results of operations.

Comprehensive
    Income

In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2011-05,

Presentation of Comprehensive Income

(ASU

No. 2011-05).

ASU

No. 2011-05

amended ASC 320,

Comprehensive Income,

to converge
    the presentation of comprehensive income between U.S GAAP and
    IFRS. ASU

No. 2011-05

requires that all nonowner changes in stockholders’ equity
    be presented in either a single continuous statement of
    comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive
    statements and also requires reclassification adjustments for
    items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to
    net income in the statement(s) where the components of net
    income and the components of other comprehensive income are
    presented. ASU

No. 2011-05

eliminates the option to present the components of other
    comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in
    stockholders’ equity. ASU

2011-05

is
    effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those
    years, beginning after December 15, 2011, which is our
    fiscal year


2013. The adoption of ASU

No. 2011-05

will affect the presentation of comprehensive income but will
    not impact our financial condition or results of operations.

Intangibles —
    Goodwill and Other: Testing Goodwill for Impairment

In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2011-08,

Intangibles — Goodwill and Other (ASC Topic 350):
    Testing for Goodwill Impairment

(ASU

No. 2011-08).

ASU

No. 2011-08

provides a company the option to first assess qualitative
    factors to determine whether the existence of certain conditions
    leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that
    the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying
    amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or
    circumstances, a company determines it is not more likely than
    not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its
    carrying amount, then performing the two-step goodwill
    impairment test is unnecessary. However, if a company concludes
    otherwise, then it is required to perform the two-step goodwill
    impairment test. ASU

No. 2011-08

is effective for fiscal years that begin after December 15,
    2011, which is our fiscal year 2013. We are currently evaluating
    the impact, if any, that ASU

No. 2011-08

may have on our financial condition and results of operations.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of the financial
    condition and results of operations is based upon the
    consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
    accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles. The preparation of these financial statements
    requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
    reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses,
    and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We
    base our estimates and judgments on historical experience,
    knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur
    in the future based on available information. We consider the
    following accounting policies to be both those most important to
    the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require
    the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ
    significantly from management’s estimates and projections,
    there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We
    also have other policies that we consider key accounting
    policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including
    the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the
    products are sold to the end user; however, the application of
    these policies does not require us to make significant estimates
    or judgments that are difficult or subjective.

Inventory
    Valuation

We value inventories at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of
    the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels,
    obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write
    down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of
    methodologies to determine the net realizable value of
    inventory. While a portion of the calculation is determined via
    reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market
    calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to
    significant judgments made by us about future demand for our
    inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our
    estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may
    need to be recorded in future periods. To date, our actual
    results have not been materially different than our estimates,
    and we do not expect them to be materially different in the
    future.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate,
    for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our
    customers to make required payments. If the financial condition
    of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may
    exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be
    required. To date, our actual results have not been materially
    different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be
    materially different in the future.

Long-Lived
    Assets

We review property, plant, and equipment and finite lived
    intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not
    be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by
    comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash
    flows that the assets are


expected to generate over their remaining economic lives. If
    such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
    recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying
    value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by
    either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by
    utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have
    recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our
    property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets
    during the past three fiscal years, except those made in
    conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our
    business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments
    in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets
    requires estimates of future operating results that are used in
    the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows.
    Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives
    of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in
    assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences
    could result in impairment charges, which could have a material
    adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in
    certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their
    estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations,
    we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised
    useful lives. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for
    impairment annually, on the first day of the fourth quarter (on
    or about August 1) or more frequently if indicators of
    impairment exist. The impairment test involves the comparison of
    the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount.

Goodwill

Goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more
    frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and
    suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be
    recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. We test
    goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating
    segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual
    basis in the fourth quarter (on or about August 1) or more
    frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. For our
    latest annual impairment assessment that occurred on
    July 31, 2011, we identified our reporting units to be our
    five operating segments, which meet the aggregation criteria for
    one reportable segment. The performance of the test involves a
    two-step process. The first step of the impairment test involves
    comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with
    their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. We
    generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using
    the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the
    discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted
    valuation methodologies, which requires significant judgment by
    management. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds
    the reporting unit’s fair value, we perform the second step
    of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of
    impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test
    involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected
    reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that
    goodwill. These impairment tests may result in impairment losses
    that could have a material adverse impact on our results of
    operations.

Value of
    Contingent Consideration related to Business
    Combination

We record contingent consideration resulting from a business
    combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. We
    generally determine the fair value of the contingent
    consideration using the income approach methodology of
    valuation. Each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these
    obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair
    value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the
    consolidated statement of income. Changes in the fair value of
    the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed
    discount periods and rates, and from changes pertaining to the
    achievement of the defined milestones. Significant judgment is
    employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions
    as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period.
    Accordingly, future business and economic conditions, as well as
    changes in any of the assumptions described above, can
    materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense
    we record in any given period.

Accounting
    for Income Taxes

We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining
    income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These
    estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits,
    benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax
    assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the
    timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and
    financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and
    penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. We assessed
    the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and
    concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the
    amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due
    to the


uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of
    certain state credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we
    evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of
    deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax
    assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the
    impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net
    operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our
    judgments regarding future profitability may change due to
    future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international
    tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require
    material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in
    a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the
    period when such determinations are made, which in turn, may
    result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a
    subsequent period.

We account for uncertain tax positions by determining if it is
    “more likely than not” that a tax position will be
    sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to
    recording any benefit in the financial statements. An uncertain
    income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50%
    likelihood of being sustained. For those tax positions where it
    is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we
    have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater
    than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement
    with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant
    information. For those income tax positions where it is not more
    likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax
    benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. We
    reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis.
    This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited
    to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law,
    effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity.
    A change in these factors would result in the recognition of a
    tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.

In the ordinary course of global business, there are many
    transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is
    uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of
    cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related
    entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no
    assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these
    matters will not be different than that which is reflected in
    our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In the event
    our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a
    material impact on our income tax provision and operating
    results in the period in which such determination is made. In
    addition to the factors described above, our current and
    expected effective tax rate is based on then-current tax law.
    Significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could
    affect these estimates.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options
    and related awards is recognized in the statement of income.
    Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be
    recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in
    calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options. We
    calculate the grant-date fair values using the Black-Scholes
    valuation model. The use of valuation models requires us to make
    estimates of the following assumptions:

Expected volatility

— We are responsible for
    estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors,
    including third-party estimates, when estimating volatility. We
    currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility
    results in the best estimate of the grant-date fair value of
    employee stock options because it reflects the market’s
    current expectations of future volatility. In evaluating the
    appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility, we
    concluded that: (1) options in our common stock are
    actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges;
    (2) the market prices of both the traded options and the
    underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to
    each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee
    share options; (3) the traded options have exercise prices
    that are both

near-the-money

and close to the exercise price of the employee share options;
    and (4) the remaining maturities of the traded options used
    to estimate volatility are at least one year.

Expected term

— We use historical employee
    exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected
    term assumption for the Black-Scholes grant-date valuation. We
    believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate
    of the expected term of a new option, and that generally, all of
    our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior. In general, the
    longer the expected term used in the Black-Scholes valuation
    model, the higher the grant-date fair value of the option.

Risk-free interest rate

— The yield on
    zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is
    commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the
    risk-free interest rate.


Expected dividend yield

— Expected dividend
    yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by
    our Board of Directors for the current quarter and dividing that
    result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the
    option. Until such time as our Board of Directors declares a
    cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current
    quarter’s cash dividend, the current dividend will be used
    in deriving this assumption. Cash dividends are not paid on
    options, restricted stock or restricted stock units.

The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized during
    a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that
    are ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated at
    the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent
    periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The
    term “forfeitures” is distinct from
    “cancellations” or “expirations” and
    represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option.
    Based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures, we have
    applied an annual forfeiture rate of 4.3% to all unvested
    stock-based awards as of October 29, 2011. The rate of 4.3%
    represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each
    year over the vesting period. This analysis is re-evaluated
    quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary.
    Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting
    period will only be for those awards that vest.

Contingencies

From time to time, we receive demands from third parties
    alleging that our products or manufacturing processes infringe
    the patent or intellectual property rights of these parties. We
    periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent
    liability should be recorded. In making this determination, we
    may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with
    internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based
    on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment
    regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we
    determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be
    incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably
    estimated. If a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we
    record a contingent loss. In determining the amount of a
    contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the
    specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement
    negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other
    factors. If the judgments and estimates made by us are
    incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses
    that could materially adversely impact our results of operations.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest
    Rate Exposure

Our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the
    general level of interest rates. In this regard, changes in
    interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable
    securities and short term investments, as well as the fair value
    of our investments, debt and interest-rate swap agreement.

Based on our marketable securities and short-term investments
    outstanding as of October 29, 2011 and October 30,
    2010, our annual interest income would change by approximately
    $38 million and $27 million, respectively, for each
    100 basis point increase in interest rates.

To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk
    associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a
    sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in
    interest rates would have on the value of our investment
    portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the
    yield curve. Based on investment positions as of
    October 29, 2011 and October 30, 2010, a hypothetical
    100 basis point increase in interest rates across all
    maturities would result in a $4 million decline in each
    year in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses
    would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to
    maturity.

As of October 29, 2011, we had $750 million in
    principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding, which
    consisted of $375 million 5% senior unsecured notes,
    due July 1, 2014 and $375 million 3% senior
    unsecured notes, due April 15, 2016. As of October 29,
    2011, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market
    interest rates would reduce the fair value of our
    $375 million of 3% senior unsecured notes outstanding
    by approximately $16 million. As of October 29, 2011
    and October 30, 2010 a similar increase in market interest
    rates would not change the fair value of our $375 million
    5% senior unsecured notes which have been hedged by an
    interest rate swap agreement. Any changes to fair value of the
    5% senior unsecured notes would be offset by the change in
    the fair value of the corresponding interest rate swap.


We hold an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the benchmark
    interest rate of our $375 million 5.0% senior
    unsecured notes due July 1, 2014. The effect of the swap is
    to convert our 5.0% fixed interest rate to a variable interest
    rate based on the three-month LIBOR plus 2.05% (2.42% as of
    October 29, 2011). In addition, we have a term loan
    facility of $145 million that bears interest at a
    fluctuating rate for each period equal to the LIBOR rate
    corresponding with the tenor of the interest period plus a
    spread of 1.25% (1.61% as of October 29, 2011). If LIBOR
    increases by 100 basis points, our annual interest expense
    would increase by approximately $5 million. However, this
    hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the
    interest expense on our $375 million of 3% fixed-rate debt,
    which is not hedged. As of October 30, 2010, a similar
    100 basis point increase in LIBOR would have resulted in an
    increase of approximately $4 million to our annual interest
    expense.

Foreign
    Currency Exposure

As more fully described in Note 2i in the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

we regularly hedge our

non-U.S. dollar-based

exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange
    contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching
    the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from
    one month to twelve months. Currently, our largest foreign
    currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European
    operations have the highest proportion of our local currency
    denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures
    existing at October 29, 2011 and October 30, 2010, a
    10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over
    the course of the year would expose us to approximately
    $6 million in losses in earnings or cash flows.

The market risk associated with our derivative instruments
    results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset
    the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and
    liabilities being hedged. The counterparties to the agreements
    relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number
    of major international financial institutions with high credit
    ratings. Based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of
    October 29, 2011, we do not believe that there is
    significant risk of nonperformance by them. While the contract
    or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide
    one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not
    represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. The amounts
    potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible
    inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their
    contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by
    which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts
    exceed our obligations to the counterparties.

The following table illustrates the effect that a 10%
    unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange
    rates, relative to the U.S. dollar, would have on the fair
    value of our forward exchange contracts as of October 29,
    2011 and October 30, 2010:

The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in
    the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition
    to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes
    typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency
    sales price as competitors’ products become more or less
    attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes
    in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a
    potential change in sales levels or local currency selling
    prices.

Description
    of Business

Analog Devices, Inc. (“Analog Devices” or the
    “Company”) is a world leader in the design,
    manufacture and marketing of a broad portfolio of
    high-performance analog, mixed-signal and digital signal
    processing integrated circuits (ICs) used in virtually all types
    of electronic equipment. Since the Company’s inception in
    1965, it has focused on solving the engineering challenges
    associated with signal processing in electronic equipment. The
    Company’s signal processing products play a fundamental
    role in converting, conditioning, and processing real-world
    phenomena such as temperature, pressure, sound, light, speed and
    motion into electrical signals to be used in a wide array of
    electronic devices. As new generations of digital applications
    evolve, new needs for high-performance analog signal processing
    and digital signal processing (DSP) technology are generated. As
    a result, the Company produces a wide range of innovative
    products — including data converters, amplifiers and
    linear products, radio frequency (RF) ICs, power management
    products, sensors based on micro-electro mechanical systems
    (MEMS) technology and other sensors, and processing products,
    including DSP and other processors — that are designed
    to meet the needs of a broad base of customers.

The Company’s products are embedded inside many types of
    electronic equipment including:

•   Industrial process control systems

•   Medical imaging equipment

•   Factory automation systems

•   Patient monitoring devices

•   Instrumentation and measurement systems

•   Wireless infrastructure equipment

•   Energy management systems

•   Networking equipment

•   Aerospace and defense electronics

•   Optical systems

•   Automobiles

•   Digital cameras

•   Digital televisions

•   Portable electronic devices

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

a.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and all of its subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all
    intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Certain
    amounts reported in previous years have been reclassified to
    conform to the fiscal 2011 presentation. Such reclassified
    amounts were immaterial. The Company’s fiscal year is the
    52-week or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to the
    last day in October. Fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 were
    52-week periods.

The Company sold its baseband chipset business and related
    support operations (Baseband Chipset Business) to MediaTek Inc.
    and sold its CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring
    business to certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation
    during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The Company has
    reflected the financial results of these businesses as
    discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income
    for all periods presented. The historical results of operations
    of these businesses have been segregated from the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements and are included in income
    from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the consolidated
    statements of income.

b.

Cash,
    Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments

Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with
    insignificant interest rate risk and maturities of three months
    or less at the time of acquisition. Cash, cash equivalents and
    short-term investments consist primarily of institutional money
    market funds and corporate obligations such as commercial paper
    and bonds. They also include bank time deposits.


ANALOG
    DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company classifies its investments in readily marketable
    debt and equity securities as

“held-to-maturity,”

“available-for-sale”

or “trading” at the time of purchase. There were no
    transfers between investment classifications in any of the
    fiscal years presented.

Held-to-maturity

securities, which are carried at amortized cost, include only
    those securities the Company has the positive intent and ability
    to hold to maturity. Securities such as bank time deposits,
    which by their nature are typically held to maturity, are
    classified as such. The Company’s other readily marketable
    cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as

available-for-sale.

Available-for-sale

securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out method) or market. The valuation of inventory requires
    the Company to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as
    inventory that is not of saleable quality. The Company employs a
    variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value
    of its inventory. While a portion of the calculation to record
    inventory at its net realizable value is based on the age of the
    inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, a key factor
    in estimating obsolete or excess inventory requires the Company
    to estimate the future demand for its products. If actual demand
    is less than the Company’s estimates, impairment charges,
    which are recorded to cost of sales, may need to be recorded in
    future periods. Inventory in excess of saleable amounts is not
    valued, and the remaining inventory is valued at the lower of
    cost or market.

Inventories at October 29, 2011 and October 30, 2010
    were as follows:

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost less
    allowances for depreciation. The straight-line method of
    depreciation is used for all classes of assets for financial
    statement purposes while both straight-line and accelerated
    methods are used for income tax purposes. Leasehold improvements
    are amortized based upon the lesser of the term of the lease or
    the useful life of the asset. Repairs and maintenance charges
    are expensed as incurred.

Depreciation and
    amortization are based on the following useful lives:

Buildings & building equipment

Up to 25 years

Machinery & equipment

3-8 years

Office equipment

3-8 years

Depreciation expense from continuing operations of property,
    plant and equipment was $116.9 million, $116.1 million
    and $132.5 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively.

The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable.
    Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of
    their carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows the
    assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic
    lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
    impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by
    which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value
    determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value
    determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. If
    such assets are not impaired, but their useful lives have
    decreased, the remaining net book value is amortized over the
    revised useful life.

Goodwill
    and Intangible Assets

Goodwill

The Company annually evaluates goodwill for impairment as well
    as whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the
    carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company
    tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level
    (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on
    an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter (on or
    about August 1) or more frequently if indicators of
    impairment exist. For our latest annual impairment assessment
    that occurred on July 31, 2011, the Company identified its
    reporting units to be its five operating segments, which meet
    the aggregation criteria for one reportable segment. The
    performance of the test involves a two-step process. The first
    step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values
    of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying
    values, including goodwill. The Company determines the fair
    value of its reporting units using the income approach
    methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow
    method as well as other generally accepted valuation
    methodologies. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit
    exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, the Company
    performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to
    determine the amount of impairment loss. The second step of the
    goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair
    value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the
    carrying value of that goodwill. No impairment of goodwill
    resulted in any of the fiscal years presented. The
    Company’s next annual impairment assessment will be
    performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal
    2012 unless indicators arise that would require the Company to
    reevaluate at an earlier date.

    presents the changes in goodwill during fiscal 2011 and 2010:

Intangible
    Assets

The Company reviews finite-lived intangible assets for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable.
    Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of
    their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows the
    assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic
    lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
    impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by
    which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value
    determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value
    determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique.
    Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on
    an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter (on or
    about August 1) or more frequently if indicators of
    impairment exist. The impairment test involves the comparison of
    the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount.
    No impairment of intangible assets resulted in any of the fiscal
    years presented.

Intangible assets, excluding in-process research and development
    (IPR&D), are amortized on a straight-line basis over their
    estimated useful lives or on an accelerated method of
    amortization that is expected to reflect the estimated pattern
    of economic use. IPR&D assets are considered
    indefinite-lived intangible assets until completion or
    abandonment of the associated R&D efforts. Upon completion
    of the projects, the IPR&D assets will be amortized over
    their estimated useful life. As of October 29, 2011,
    finite-lived intangible assets were fully amortized.

Amortization expense related to intangibles was
    $1.3 million, $4.8 million and $7.4 million in
    fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Grant
    Accounting

Certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries have received
    grants from governmental agencies. These grants include capital,
    employment and research and development grants. Capital grants
    for the acquisition of property and equipment are netted against
    the related capital expenditures and amortized as a credit to
    depreciation expense over the useful life of the related asset.
    Employment grants, which relate to employee hiring and training,
    and research and development grants are recognized in earnings
    in the period in which the related expenditures are incurred by
    the Company.

Translation
    of Foreign Currencies

The functional currency for the Company’s foreign sales and
    research and development operations is the applicable local
    currency. Gains and losses resulting from translation of these
    foreign currencies into U.S. dollars are recorded in
    accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. Transaction gains
    and losses and re-measurement of foreign currency denominated
    assets and liabilities are included in income currently,
    including those at the Company’s principal foreign
    manufacturing operations where the functional currency is the
    U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses
    included in other expenses, net, were not material in fiscal
    2011, 2010 or 2009.

Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Agreements

Foreign Exchange Exposure Management

— The
    Company enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts
    to offset certain operational and balance sheet exposures from
    the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Such
    exposures result from the portion of the Company’s
    operations, assets and liabilities that are denominated in
    currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro;
    other significant exposures include the Philippine Peso and the
    British Pound. These foreign currency exchange contracts are
    entered into to support transactions made in the normal course
    of business, and accordingly, are not speculative in nature. The
    contracts are for periods consistent with the terms of the
    underlying transactions, generally one year or less. Hedges
    related to anticipated transactions are designated and
    documented at the inception of the respective hedges as cash
    flow hedges and are evaluated for effectiveness monthly.
    Derivative instruments are employed to eliminate or minimize
    certain foreign currency exposures that can be confidently
    identified and quantified. As the terms of the contract and the
    underlying transaction are matched at inception, forward
    contract effectiveness is calculated by comparing the change in
    fair value of the contract to the change in the forward value of
    the anticipated transaction, with the effective portion of the
    gain or loss on the derivative instrument reported as a
    component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income (OCI)
    in shareholders’ equity and reclassified into earnings in
    the same period during which the hedged transaction affects
    earnings. Any residual change in fair value of the instruments,
    or ineffectiveness, is recognized immediately in other (income)
    expense. Additionally, the Company enters into forward foreign
    currency contracts that economically hedge the gains and losses
    generated by the re-measurement of certain recorded assets and
    liabilities in a non-functional currency. Changes in the fair
    value of these undesignated hedges are recognized in other
    (income) expense immediately as an offset to the changes in the
    fair value of the asset or liability being hedged. As of
    October 29, 2011 and October 30, 2010, the total
    notional amount of these


ANALOG
    DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

undesignated hedges was $41.2 million and
    $42.1 million, respectively. The fair value of these
    hedging instruments in the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheets as of October 29, 2011 and October 30, 2010 was
    immaterial.

Interest Rate Exposure Management

— On
    June 30, 2009, the Company entered into interest rate swap
    transactions related to its outstanding 5.0% senior
    unsecured notes where the Company swapped the notional amount of
    its $375 million of fixed rate debt at 5.0% into floating
    interest rate debt through July 1, 2014. Under the terms of
    the swaps, the Company will (i) receive on the
    $375 million notional amount a 5.0% annual interest payment
    that is paid in two installments on the 1st of every
    January and July, commencing January 1, 2010 through and
    ending on the maturity date; and (ii) pay on the
    $375 million notional amount an annual three month LIBOR
    plus 2.05% (2.42% as of October 29, 2011) interest
    payment, payable in four installments on the 1st of every
    January, April, July and October, commencing on October 1,
    2009 and ending on the maturity date. The LIBOR-based rate is
    set quarterly three months prior to the date of the interest
    payment. The Company designated these swaps as fair value
    hedges. The fair value of the swaps at inception was zero and
    subsequent changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps
    were reflected in the carrying value of the interest rate swaps
    on the balance sheet. The carrying value of the debt on the
    balance sheet was adjusted by an equal and offsetting amount.

The
    gain or loss on the hedged item (that is, the fixed-rate
    borrowings) attributable to the hedged benchmark interest rate
    risk and the offsetting gain or loss on the related interest
    rate swaps for fiscal year 2011 and fiscal year 2010 were as
    follows:

The amounts earned and owed under the swap agreements are
    accrued each period and are reported in interest expense. There
    was no ineffectiveness recognized in any of the periods
    presented.

The market risk associated with the Company’s derivative
    instruments results from currency exchange rate or interest rate
    movements that are expected to offset the market risk of the
    underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged.
    The counterparties to the agreements relating to the
    Company’s derivative instruments consist of a number of
    major international financial institutions with high credit
    ratings. Based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of
    October 29, 2011, we do not believe that there is
    significant risk of nonperformance by them. Furthermore, none of
    the Company’s derivative transactions are subject to
    collateral or other security arrangements and none contain
    provisions that are dependent on the Company’s credit
    ratings from any credit rating agency. While the contract or
    notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one
    measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not
    represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to credit
    risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising
    from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms
    of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if
    any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the
    contracts exceed the obligations of the Company to the
    counterparties. As a result of the above considerations, the
    Company does not consider the risk of counterparty default to be
    significant.

The Company records the fair value of its derivative financial
    instruments in the consolidated financial statements in other
    current assets, other assets or accrued liabilities, depending
    on their net position, regardless of the purpose or intent for
    holding the derivative contract. Changes in the fair value of
    the derivative financial instruments are either recognized
    periodically in earnings or in shareholders’ equity as a
    component of OCI. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges
    are recorded in OCI and reclassified into earnings when the
    underlying contract matures. Changes in the fair values of
    derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting are reported in
    earnings as they occur.

The total notional amounts of derivative instruments designated
    as hedging instruments as of October 29, 2011 and
    October 30, 2010 were $375 million of interest rate
    swap agreements accounted for as fair value hedges and
    $153.7 million and $139.9 million, respectively, of
    cash flow hedges denominated in Euros, British Pounds and

Fair
    Value

The Company defines fair value as the price that would be
    received to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in
    an orderly transaction between market participants at the
    measurement date. The Company applies the following fair value
    hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair
    value into three levels and bases the categorization within the
    hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and
    significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy gives
    the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active
    markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1
    measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs
    (Level 3 measurements).

Level 1

— Level 1 inputs are quoted
    prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
    liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access
    at the measurement date.


ANALOG
    DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Level 2

— Level 2 inputs are inputs
    other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are
    observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
    indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified
    (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for
    substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

Level 3

— Level 3 inputs are
    unobservable inputs for the asset or liability in which there is
    little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at
    the measurement date. As of October 30, 2010, the Company
    held no assets or liabilities measured on a recurring basis
    using Level 3 inputs.

The table below sets forth by level the Company’s financial
    assets and liabilities, excluding accrued interest components,
    that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of
    October 29, 2011 and October 30, 2010. The table
    excludes cash on hand and assets and liabilities that are
    measured at historical cost or any basis other than fair value.

The Company has a master netting arrangement by counterparty
    with respect to derivative contracts. As of October 29,
    2011 and October 30, 2010, contracts in a liability
    position of $0.8 million in each year, were netted against
    contracts in an asset position in the consolidated balance

Equal to the accreted notional value of the debt plus the fair
    value of the interest rate component of the long-term debt. The
    fair value of the long-term debt as of October 29, 2011 and
    October 30, 2010 was $413.4 million and
    $416.3 million, respectively.

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company
    in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial
    instruments:

Cash equivalents and short-term investments

— These investments are adjusted to fair value
    based on quoted market prices or are determined using a yield
    curve model based on current market rates.

Deferred compensation plan investments and other
    investments

— The fair value of these
    mutual fund, money market fund and equity investments are based
    on quoted market prices.

Long-term debt

— The fair value of
    long-term debt is based on quotes received from third-party
    banks.

Interest rate swap agreements

— The fair
    value of interest rate swap agreements is based on quotes
    received from third-party banks. These values represent the
    estimated amount the Company would receive or pay to terminate
    the agreements taking into consideration current interest rates
    as well as the creditworthiness of the counterparty.

Forward foreign currency exchange
    contracts

— The estimated fair value of
    forward foreign currency exchange contracts, which includes
    derivatives that are accounted for as cash flow hedges and those
    that are not designated as cash flow hedges, is based on the
    estimated amount the Company would receive if it sold these
    agreements at the reporting date taking into consideration
    current interest rates as well as the creditworthiness of the
    counterparty for assets and the Company’s creditworthiness
    for liabilities.

Contingent consideration

— The fair
    value of contingent consideration was estimated utilizing the
    income approach and is based upon significant inputs not
    observable in the market. Changes in the fair value of the
    contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date that
    are primarily driven by assumptions pertaining to the
    achievement of the defined milestones will be recognized in
    operating income in the period of the estimated fair value
    change.

The following table summarizes the change in the fair value of
    the contingent consideration measured using significant

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial
    statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
    during the reporting period. Such estimates relate to the useful
    lives of fixed assets and identified intangible assets,
    allowances for doubtful accounts and customer returns, the net
    realizable value of inventory, potential reserves relating to
    litigation matters, accrued liabilities, accrued taxes, deferred
    tax valuation allowances, assumptions pertaining to share-based
    payments and other reserves. Actual results could differ from
    those estimates and such differences may be material to the
    financial statements.

l.

Concentrations
    of Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
    concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments
    and trade accounts receivable.

The Company maintains cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments and long-term investments with high credit quality
    counterparties, continually monitors the amount of credit
    exposure to any one issuer and diversifies its investments in
    order to minimize its credit risk.

The Company sells its products to distributors and original
    equipment manufacturers involved in a variety of industries
    including industrial process automation, instrumentation,
    defense/aerospace, automotive, communications, computers and
    computer peripherals and consumer electronics. The Company has
    adopted credit policies and standards to accommodate growth in
    these markets. The Company performs continuing credit
    evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and
    although the Company generally does not require collateral, the
    Company may require letters of credit from customers in certain
    circumstances. The Company provides reserves for estimated
    amounts of accounts receivable that may not be collected.

m.

Concentration
    of Other Risks

The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid
    technological change, competitive pricing pressures and cyclical
    market patterns. The Company’s financial results are
    affected by a wide variety of factors, including general
    economic conditions worldwide, economic conditions specific to
    the semiconductor industry, the timely implementation of new
    manufacturing technologies, the ability to safeguard patents and
    intellectual property in a rapidly evolving market and reliance
    on assembly and test subcontractors, third-party wafer
    fabricators and independent distributors. In addition, the
    semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject
    to significant economic downturns at various times. The Company
    is exposed to the risk of obsolescence of its inventory
    depending on the mix of future business. Additionally, a large
    portion of the Company’s purchases of external wafer and
    foundry services are from a limited number of suppliers,
    primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). If
    TSMC or any of the Company’s other key suppliers are unable
    or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of
    components, on the time schedule and of the quality that the
    Company requires, the Company may be forced to engage additional
    or replacement suppliers, which could result in significant
    expenses and disruptions or delays in manufacturing, product
    development and shipment of product to the Company’s
    customers. Although the Company has experienced shortages of
    components, materials and external foundry services from time to
    time, these items have generally been available to the Company
    as needed.

n.

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue from product sales to customers is generally recognized
    when title passes, which for shipments to certain foreign
    countries is subsequent to product shipment. Title for these
    shipments ordinarily passes within a week of shipment. A reserve
    for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based
    on historical experience or specific identification of an event
    necessitating a reserve.


ANALOG
    DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In all regions of the world, the Company defers revenue and the
    related cost of sales on shipments to distributors until the
    distributors resell the products to their customers. Therefore,
    the Company’s revenue fully reflects end customer purchases
    and is not impacted by distributor inventory levels. Sales to
    distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors
    to receive price-adjustment credits, as discussed below, and to
    return qualifying products for credit, as determined by the
    Company, in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving,
    discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. These
    agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of the
    value of the Company’s shipments to that distributor during
    the prior quarter. In addition, distributors are allowed to
    return unsold products if the Company terminates the
    relationship with the distributor.

Distributors are granted price-adjustment credits related to
    many of their sales to their customers. Price-adjustment credits
    are granted when the distributor’s standard cost (i.e., the
    Company’s sales price to the distributor) does not provide
    the distributor with an appropriate margin on its sales to its
    customers. As distributors negotiate selling prices with their
    customers, the final sales price agreed to with the customer
    will be influenced by many factors, including the particular
    product being sold, the quantity ordered, the particular
    customer, the geographic location of the distributor and the
    competitive landscape. As a result, the distributor may request
    and receive a price-adjustment credit from the Company to allow
    the distributor to earn an appropriate margin on the transaction.

Distributors are also granted price-adjustment credits in the
    event of a price decrease subsequent to the date the product was
    shipped and billed to the distributor. Generally, the Company
    will provide a credit equal to the difference between the price
    paid by the distributor (less any prior credits on such
    products) and the new price for the product multiplied by the
    quantity of such product in the distributor’s inventory at
    the time of the price decrease.

Given the uncertainties associated with the levels of
    price-adjustment credits to be granted to distributors, the
    sales price to the distributor is not fixed or determinable
    until the distributor resells the products to their customers.
    Therefore, the Company defers revenue recognition from sales to
    distributors until the distributors have sold the products to
    their customers.

Title to the inventory transfers to the distributor at the time
    of shipment or delivery to the distributor, and payment from the
    distributor is due in accordance with the Company’s
    standard payment terms. These payment terms are not contingent
    upon the distributors’ sale of the products to their
    customers. Upon title transfer to distributors, inventory is
    reduced for the cost of goods shipped, the margin (sales less
    cost of sales) is recorded as “deferred income on shipments
    to distributors, net” and an account receivable is recorded.

The deferred costs of sales to distributors have historically
    had very little risk of impairment due to the margins the
    Company earns on sales of its products and the relatively long
    life-cycle of the Company’s products. Product returns from
    distributors that are ultimately scrapped have historically been
    immaterial. In addition, price protection and price-adjustment
    credits granted to distributors historically have not exceeded
    the margins the Company earns on sales of its products. The
    Company continuously monitors the level and nature of product
    returns and is in continuous contact with the distributors to
    ensure reserves are established for all known material issues.

As of October 29, 2011 and October 30, 2010, the
    Company had gross deferred revenue of $311.3 million and
    $327.2 million, respectively, and gross deferred cost of
    sales of $78.1 million and $84.4 million,
    respectively. Deferred income on shipments to distributors
    decreased by approximately $9.6 million in fiscal 2011
    primarily as a result of the distributors’ sales to their
    customers in fiscal 2011 exceeding the Company’s shipments
    to its distributors during this same time period.

Shipping costs are charged to cost of sales as incurred.

The Company generally offers a

12-month

warranty for its products. The Company’s warranty policy
    provides for replacement of the defective product. Specific
    accruals are recorded for known product warranty issues. Product
    warranty expenses during fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009 were not
    material.

    was $4.1 million in fiscal 2011, $3.7 million in
    fiscal 2010 and $5.2 million in fiscal 2009.

q.

Income
    Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
    differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets
    and liabilities and are measured using the enacted income tax
    rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the
    temporary differences are expected to reverse. Additionally,
    deferred tax assets and liabilities are separated into current
    and non-current amounts based on the classification of the
    related assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes.

r.

Earnings
    Per Share of Common Stock

Basic earnings per share is computed based only on the weighted
    average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
    Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted
    average number of common shares outstanding during the period,
    plus the dilutive effect of potential future issuances of common
    stock relating to stock option programs and other potentially
    dilutive securities using the treasury stock method. In
    calculating diluted earnings per share, the dilutive effect of
    stock options is computed using the average market price for the
    respective period. In addition, the assumed proceeds under the
    treasury stock method include the average unrecognized
    compensation expense of stock options that are

in-the-money

and restricted stock units. This results in the
    “assumed” buyback of additional shares, thereby
    reducing the dilutive impact of stock options. Potential shares
    related to certain of the Company’s outstanding stock
    options were excluded because they were anti-dilutive. Those
    potential shares, determined based on the weighted average
    exercise prices during the respective years, related to the
    Company’s outstanding stock options could be dilutive in
    the future.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on
    the grant-date fair value of the awards ultimately expected to
    vest, and is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis
    over the vesting period, which is generally five years for stock
    options and generally three years for restricted stock units.
    Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be
    recorded requires the Company to develop estimates used in
    calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options. The
    Company calculates the grant-date fair value using the
    Black-Scholes valuation model. The use of valuation models
    requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions such as
    expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate,
    expected dividend yield and forfeiture rates.

See Note 3 for additional information relating to
    stock-based compensation.

Discontinued
    Operations

In November 2007, the Company entered into a purchase and sale
    agreement with certain subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor
    Corporation to sell the Company’s CPU voltage regulation
    and PC thermal monitoring business which consisted of core
    voltage regulator products for the central processing unit in
    computing and gaming applications and temperature sensors and
    fan-speed controllers for managing the temperature of the
    central processing unit. During fiscal 2008, the Company
    completed the sale of this business. In the first quarter of
    fiscal 2010, proceeds of $1 million were released from
    escrow and $0.6 million net of tax was recorded as
    additional gain from the sale of discontinued operations. The
    Company does not expect any additional proceeds from this sale.

In September 2007, the Company entered into a definitive
    agreement to sell its Baseband Chipset Business to MediaTek Inc.
    The decision to sell the Baseband Chipset Business was due to
    the Company’s decision to focus its resources in areas
    where its signal processing expertise can provide unique
    capabilities and earn superior returns. During fiscal 2008 the
    Company completed the sale of its Baseband Chipset Business for
    net cash proceeds of $269 million. The Company made cash
    payments of $1.7 million during fiscal 2009 related to
    retention payments for employees who transferred to MediaTek
    Inc. and for the reimbursement of intellectual property license
    fees incurred by MediaTek. During fiscal 2010, the Company
    received cash proceeds of $62 million as a result of the
    receipt of a refundable withholding tax and also recorded an
    additional gain on sale of $0.3 million, or
    $0.2 million net of tax, due to the settlement of certain
    items at less than the amounts accrued. In fiscal 2011,
    additional proceeds of $10 million were released from
    escrow and $6.5 million net of tax was recorded as
    additional gain from the sale of discontinued operations. The
    Company does not expect any additional proceeds from this sale.

Stock-Based
    Compensation and Shareholders’ Equity

Equity
    Compensation Plans

The Company grants, or has granted, stock options and other
    stock and stock-based awards under The 2006 Stock Incentive Plan
    (2006 Plan). The 2006 Plan was approved by the Company’s
    Board of Directors on January 23, 2006 and was approved by
    shareholders on March 14, 2006 and subsequently amended in
    March 2006, June 2009, September 2009, December 2009, December
    2010 and June 2011. The 2006 Plan provides for the grant of up
    to 15 million shares of the Company’s common stock,
    plus such number of additional shares that were subject to
    outstanding options under the Company’s previous plans that
    are not issued because the applicable option award subsequently
    terminates or expires without being exercised. The 2006 Plan
    provides for the grant of incentive stock options intended to
    qualify under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of
    1986, as amended, non-statutory stock options, stock
    appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units
    and other stock-based awards. Employees, officers, directors,
    consultants and advisors of the Company and its subsidiaries are
    eligible to be granted awards under the 2006 Plan. No award may
    be made under the 2006 Plan after March 13, 2016, but
    awards previously granted may extend beyond that date. The
    Company will not grant further options under any previous plans.

While the Company may grant to employees options that become
    exercisable at different times or within different periods, the
    Company has generally granted to employees options that vest
    over five years and become exercisable in annual installments of
    20% on each of the first, second, third, fourth and fifth
    anniversaries of the date of grant;


/


%
    on each of the third, fourth, and fifth anniversaries of the
    date of grant; or in annual installments of 25% on each of the
    second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of
    grant. The maximum contractual term of all options is ten years.
    In addition, the Company has granted to employees restricted
    stock units that generally vest in one installment on the third
    anniversary of the grant date.

As of October 29, 2011, a total of 10,803,862 common shares
    were available for future grant and 47,007,728 common shares
    were reserved for issuance under the 2006 Plan.

Grant-Date
    Fair Value

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to
    calculate the grant-date fair value of stock option awards. The
    grant date fair value of restricted stock units represents the
    value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant,
    reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on
    the Company’s common stock prior to vesting.

Expected volatility —

The Company is
    responsible for estimating volatility and has considered a
    number of factors, including third-party estimates, when
    estimating volatility. The Company currently believes that the
    exclusive use of implied volatility results in the best estimate
    of the grant-date fair value of employee stock options because
    it reflects the market’s current expectations of future
    volatility. In evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively
    relying on implied volatility, the Company concluded that:
    (1) options in the Company’s common stock are actively
    traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges; (2) the
    market prices of both the traded options and the underlying
    shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and
    on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options;
    (3) the traded options have exercise prices that are both

near-the-money

and close to the exercise price of the employee share options;
    and (4) the remaining maturities of the traded options used
    to estimate volatility are at least one year.

Expected term —

The Company uses historical
    employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the
    expected term assumption for the Black-Scholes grant-date
    valuation. The Company believes that this historical data is
    currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new
    option, and that generally its employees exhibit similar
    exercise behavior.

Risk-free interest rate —

The yield on
    zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is
    commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the
    risk-free interest rate.

Expected dividend yield —

Expected dividend
    yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by
    the Company’s Board of Directors for the current quarter
    and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date
    of grant. Until such time as the Company’s Board of
    Directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is
    different from the current quarter’s cash dividend, the
    current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption. Cash
    dividends are not paid on options, restricted stock or
    restricted stock units.

Stock-Based
    Compensation Expense

The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized during
    a period is based on the value of the awards that are ultimately
    expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant
    and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual
    forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term
    “forfeitures” is distinct from
    “cancellations” or “expirations” and
    represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered
    stock-based award. Based on an analysis of its historical
    forfeitures, the Company has applied an annual forfeiture rate
    of 4.3% to all unvested stock-based awards as of
    October 29, 2011. The rate of 4.3% represents the portion
    that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting
    period. This analysis will be re-evaluated quarterly and the
    forfeiture rate will be adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the
    actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be
    for those options that vest.

Additional

paid-in-capital

(APIC) Pool

The APIC pool represents the excess tax benefits related to
    share-based compensation that are available to absorb future tax
    deficiencies. If the amount of future tax deficiencies is
    greater than the available APIC pool, the Company records the
    excess as income tax expense in its consolidated statements of
    income. For fiscal years 2009 and 2010, the Company had a
    sufficient APIC pool to cover any tax deficiencies recorded and
    as a result, these deficiencies did not affect its results of
    operations. During fiscal 2011, the Company recognized an
    immaterial amount of income tax expense resulting from tax
    shortfalls related to share-based compensation in its
    consolidated statement of income.

Stock-option
    Exchange

During fiscal 2009, shareholders approved and the Company
    completed an employee stock option exchange program (Option
    Exchange). The Option Exchange provided eligible employees of
    the Company, except named executive officers and directors, the
    opportunity to exchange eligible stock option grants for a
    smaller number of new stock options with a lower exercise price,
    or in some instances cash, that had approximately the same fair
    value as the options surrendered.

On September 28, 2009 the Company granted stock options for
    approximately 15.2 million shares in the aggregate to
    approximately 3,100 employees who elected to participate in
    the Option Exchange. The new stock options issued were subject
    to a new vesting period and a new contractual term based on the
    grant date of the original options. In addition, the Company
    made cash payments of approximately $2.6 million to
    approximately 5,100 employees whose exchanged options would
    each have resulted in a new stock option for fewer than
    100 shares. As a result of the exchange, employees elected
    to surrender options for approximately 33.6 million
    options, which were cancelled upon the grant of the new options
    on September 28, 2009.

The exchange of options in this Option Exchange is treated as a
    modification of the existing stock options for accounting
    purposes. Accordingly, any unrecognized compensation expense
    from the surrendered stock options will be recognized over the
    original service period of the surrendered option. Because the
    exchange ratios were calculated to result in the fair value of
    surrendered eligible stock options that was approximately equal
    to the fair value of the new stock options replacing them, the
    amount of incremental expense was immaterial.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised (i.e. the
    difference between the market price at exercise and the price
    paid by the employee to exercise the options) during fiscal
    2011, 2010 and 2009 was $96.5 million, $29.6 million
    and $4.7 million, respectively. The total amount of
    proceeds received by the Company from exercise of these options
    during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $217.4 million,
    $240.4 million and $15.1 million, respectively.

Proceeds from stock option exercises pursuant to employee stock
    plans in the Company’s statement of cash flows of
    $217.2 million, $216.1 million and $12.4 million
    for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, are net of the
    value of shares surrendered by employees in certain limited
    circumstances to satisfy the exercise price of options, and to
    satisfy employee tax obligations upon vesting of restricted
    stock or restricted stock units and in connection with the
    exercise of stock options granted to the Company’s
    employees under the Company’s equity compensation plans.
    The withholding amount is based on the Company’s minimum
    statutory withholding requirement.

As of October 29, 2011, there was $88.6 million of
    total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested
    share-based awards comprised of stock options and restricted
    stock units. That cost is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted-average period of 1.3 years. The total grant-date
    fair value of shares that vested during fiscal 2011, 2010 and
    2009 was approximately $49.6 million, $67.7 million
    and $74.4 million, respectively.

Common
    Stock Repurchase Program

The Company’s common stock repurchase program has been in
    place since August 2004. In the aggregate, the Board of
    Directors has authorized the Company to repurchase
    $5 billion of the Company’s common stock under the
    program. Under the program, the Company may repurchase
    outstanding shares of its common stock from time to time in the
    open market and through privately negotiated transactions.
    Unless terminated earlier by resolution of the Company’s
    Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when the
    Company has repurchased all shares authorized under the program.
    As of October 29, 2011, the Company had repurchased a total
    of approximately 125.0 million shares of its common stock
    for approximately $4,278.5 million under this program. An
    additional $721.5 million remains available for repurchase
    of shares under the current authorized program. The repurchased
    shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common
    stock. Any future common stock repurchases will be dependent
    upon several factors, including the amount of cash available to
    the Company in the United States and the Company’s
    financial performance, outlook and liquidity. The Company also
    from time to time repurchases shares in settlement of employee
    tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted
    stock units, or in certain limited circumstances to satisfy the
    exercise price of options granted to the Company’s
    employees under the Company’s equity compensation plans.

    been identified as the Chief Operating Decision Maker.

Revenue
    Trends by End Market

The following table summarizes revenue by end market. The
    categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a
    variety of data points including the technical characteristics
    of the product, the “sold to” customer information,
    the “ship to” customer information and the end
    customer product or application into which the Company’s
    product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and
    tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of
    products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, the
    Company reclassifies revenue by end market for prior periods.
    Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the
    sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end
    market. During fiscal year 2011, the Company consolidated the
    computer end market, which represented approximately 1% of
    fiscal 2011 revenue, into the consumer end market, and
    reclassified handset revenue, which represented approximately 3%
    of fiscal 2011 revenue, from the communications end market to
    the consumer end market, for all periods presented.

Revenue
    Trends by Product

The following table summarizes revenue by product categories.
    The categorization of the Company’s products into broad
    categories is based on the characteristics of the individual
    products, the specification of the products and in some cases
    the specific uses that certain products have within
    applications. The categorization of products into categories is
    therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over
    time. In instances where products move between product
    categories, the Company reclassifies the amounts in the product
    categories for all prior periods.

Closure
    of Wafer Fabrication Facility in Sunnyvale

The Company ceased production at its California wafer
    fabrication facility in November 2006. The Company paid the
    related lease obligation costs on a monthly basis over the
    remaining lease term, which expired in March 2010. The Company
    recorded a one-time settlement charge of $0.4 million in
    fiscal 2010 related to the termination of the lease. This action
    was completed during fiscal 2010.

Consolidation
    of a Wafer Fabrication Facility in Limerick

During fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2010, the Company recorded
    special charges of $16.4 million as a result of its
    decision to only use eight-inch technology at its wafer
    fabrication facility in Limerick. These special charges included
    $14.9 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in
    accordance with the Company’s ongoing benefit plan for 150
    manufacturing employees and $1.5 million for

clean-up

and
    closure costs that were expensed as incurred. The production in
    the six-inch wafer fabrication facility ceased during the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2009. This action was completed during fiscal
    2010.

Reduction
    of Operating Costs

During fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2010, in order to further
    reduce its operating cost structure, the Company recorded
    special charges of approximately $43.3 million. These
    special charges included: $39.1 million for severance and
    fringe benefit costs in accordance with its ongoing benefit plan
    or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 245
    manufacturing employees and 470 engineering and SMG&A
    employees; $2.1 million for lease obligation costs for
    facilities that the Company ceased using during the first
    quarter of fiscal 2009; $0.8 million for the write-off of
    property, plant and equipment; $0.5 million for contract
    termination costs and $0.3 million for

clean-up

and
    closure costs that were expensed as incurred; and
    $0.5 million related to the impairment of intellectual
    property. The Company terminated the employment of all employees
    associated with this action and is paying amounts owed to them
    as income continuance.

During fiscal 2011, in order to further reduce its operating
    cost structure, the Company recorded a special charge of
    approximately $2.2 million for severance and fringe benefit
    costs in accordance with its ongoing benefit plan or statutory
    requirements at foreign locations for 25 engineering and
    SMG&A employees. As of October 29, 2011, the Company
    still employed 13 of the 25 employees included in this cost
    reduction action. These employees must continue to be employed
    by the Company until their employment is involuntarily
    terminated in order to receive the severance benefit.

Closure
    of a Wafer Fabrication Facility in Cambridge

During fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010, the Company recorded special
    charges of $26.8 million as a result of its decision to
    consolidate its Cambridge, Massachusetts wafer fabrication
    facility into its existing Wilmington, Massachusetts facility.
    These special charges included: $7.4 million for severance
    and fringe benefit costs recorded in accordance with the
    Company’s ongoing benefit plan for 124 manufacturing
    employees and 9 SMG&A employees; $14.6 million for the
    impairment of manufacturing assets; $3.4 million for lease
    obligation costs for the Cambridge wafer fabrication facility,
    which the Company ceased using in the first quarter of fiscal
    2010; and $1.4 million for

clean-up

and
    closure costs that were expensed as incurred. This action was
    completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2011.

6.

Acquisitions

In fiscal 2006, the Company acquired substantially all the
    outstanding stock of privately-held Integrant Technologies, Inc.
    (Integrant) of Seoul, Korea. The acquisition enabled the Company
    to enter the mobile TV market and strengthened its presence in
    the Asian region. The Company paid $8.4 million related to
    the purchase of shares from the founder of Integrant during the
    period from July 2007 through July 2009. The Company recorded
    these payments as additional goodwill.

In fiscal 2006, the Company acquired all the outstanding stock
    of privately-held AudioAsics A/S (AudioAsics) of Roskilde,
    Denmark. The acquisition of AudioAsics allowed the Company to
    continue developing low-power audio solutions, while expanding
    its presence in the Nordic and Eastern European regions. The
    Company paid additional cash payments of $3.1 million
    during fiscal 2009 for the achievement of revenue-based
    milestones during the period from October 2006 through January
    2009, which were recorded as additional goodwill. In addition,
    the Company paid $3.2 million during fiscal 2009 based on
    the achievement of technological milestones during the period
    from October 2006 through January 2009, which were recorded as
    compensation expense in fiscal 2008. All revenue and
    technological milestones related to this acquisition have been
    met and no additional payments will be made.

On June 9, 2011, the Company acquired privately-held Lyric
    Semiconductor, Inc. (Lyric) of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The
    acquisition of Lyric gives the Company the potential to achieve
    an order of magnitude improvement in power efficiency in mixed
    signal processing. The acquisition-date fair value of the
    consideration transferred totaled $27.8 million, which
    consisted of $14.0 million in initial cash payments at
    closing and

74.1

ANALOG
    DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

contingent consideration of up to $13.8 million. The
    contingent consideration arrangement requires additional cash
    payments to the former equity holders of Lyric upon the
    achievement of certain technological and product development
    milestones payable during the period from June 2011 through June
    2016. The Company estimated the fair value of the contingent
    consideration arrangement utilizing the income approach. Changes
    in the fair value of the contingent consideration subsequent to
    the acquisition date primarily driven by assumptions pertaining
    to the achievement of the defined milestones will be recognized
    in operating income in the period of the estimated fair value
    change. As of October 29, 2011, no contingent payments have
    been made and the fair value of the contingent consideration was
    approximately $14.0 million. The Company allocated the
    purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired
    and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at
    the date of acquisition, resulting in the recognition of
    $12.2 million of IPR&D, $18.9 million of goodwill
    and $3.3 million of net deferred tax liabilities. The
    goodwill recognized is attributable to future technologies that
    have yet to be determined as well as the assembled workforce of
    Lyric. Future technologies do not meet the criteria for
    recognition separately from goodwill because they are a part of
    future development and growth of the business. None of the
    goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. In
    addition, the Company will be obligated to pay royalties to the
    former equity holders of Lyric on revenue recognized from the
    sale of Lyric products and licenses through the earlier of
    20 years or the accrual of a maximum of $25 million.
    Royalty payments to Lyric employees require post-acquisition
    services to be rendered and, as such, the Company will record
    these amounts as compensation expense in the related periods. As
    of October 29, 2011, no royalty payments have been made.
    The Company recognized $0.2 million of acquisition-related
    costs that were expensed in the third quarter of fiscal 2011.
    These costs are included in operating expenses in the
    consolidated statement of income.

The Company has not provided pro forma results of operations for
    Integrant, AudioAsics and Lyric herein as they were not material
    to the Company on either an individual or an aggregate basis.
    The Company included the results of operations of each
    acquisition in its consolidated statement of income from the
    date of such acquisition.

    2010, respectively. Adjustments to the fair value of, and income
    pertaining to, Deferred Compensation Plan investments are
    recorded in operating expenses. Gross realized and unrealized
    gains and losses from trading securities were not material in
    fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009.

The Company has recorded a corresponding liability for amounts
    owed to the Deferred Compensation Plan participants (see
    Note 10). These investments are specifically designated as
    available to the Company solely for the purpose of paying
    benefits under the Deferred Compensation Plan. However, in the
    event the Company became insolvent, the investments would be
    available to all unsecured general creditors.

Other
    Investments

Other investments consist of equity securities and other
    long-term investments. Investments are stated at fair value,
    which is based on market quotes or on a cost-basis, dependent on
    the nature of the investment, as appropriate. Adjustments to the
    fair value of investments classified as

in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, unless the
    adjustment is considered an

other-than-temporary

impairment, in which case the adjustment is recorded as a charge
    in the statement of income.

During fiscal 2010, the Company recognized an

other-than-temporary

impairment of $0.7 million. The investment impairment was
    related to the decline in fair value of a publicly-traded equity
    investment below cost basis that was determined to be

other-than-temporary.

There were no realized gains or losses recorded in fiscal 2011,
    2010 or 2009.

Deferred
    Compensation Plan Liability

The deferred compensation plan liability relates to obligations
    due under the Deferred Compensation Plan. The Deferred
    Compensation Plan allows certain members of management and other
    highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer
    receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. The balance
    represents Deferred Compensation Plan participant accumulated
    deferrals and earnings thereon since the inception of the
    Deferred Compensation Plan net of withdrawals. The
    Company’s liability under the Deferred Compensation Plan is
    an unsecured general obligation of the Company.

11.

Lease
    Commitments

The Company leases certain of its facilities, equipment and
    software under various operating leases that expire at various
    dates through 2022. The lease agreements frequently include
    renewal and escalation clauses and require the Company to pay
    taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. Total rental expense
    under operating leases was approximately $45 million in
    fiscal 2011, $40 million in fiscal 2010 and
    $40 million in fiscal 2009.

13.

Retirement
    Plans

The Company and its subsidiaries have various savings and
    retirement plans covering substantially all employees. The
    Company maintains a defined contribution plan for the benefit of
    its eligible U.S. employees. This plan provides for Company
    contributions of up to 5% of each participant’s total
    eligible compensation. In addition, the Company contributes an
    amount equal to each participant’s pre-tax contribution, if
    any, up to a maximum of 3% of each participant’s total
    eligible compensation. The total expense related to the defined
    contribution plan for U.S. employees was $21.9 million
    in fiscal 2011, $20.5 million in fiscal 2010 and
    $21.5 million in fiscal 2009. The Company also has various
    defined benefit pension and other retirement plans for certain

non-U.S. employees

that are consistent with local statutory requirements and
    practices. The total expense related to the various defined
    benefit pension and other retirement plans for certain

non-U.S. employees

was $21.4 million in fiscal 2011, $11.7 million in
    fiscal 2010 and $10.9 million in fiscal 2009.

Non-U.S.

Assumptions

The range of assumptions used for the

non-U.S. defined

benefit plans reflects the different economic environments
    within the various countries.

The
    projected benefit obligation was determined using the following
    weighted-average assumptions:



Discount rate

5.60

%

5.33

%

Rate of increase in compensation levels

3.07

%

3.40

%

Net annual periodic pension cost was determined using the
    following weighted average assumptions:



Discount rate

%

6.32

%

Expected long-term return on plan assets

6.15

%

6.73

%

Rate of increase in compensation levels

3.40

%

3.72

%

The expected long-term rate of return on assets is a
    weighted-average of the long-term rates of return selected for
    the various countries where the Company has funded pension
    plans. The expected long-term rate of return on assets
    assumption is selected based on the facts and circumstances that
    exist as of the measurement date and the specific portfolio mix
    of plan assets. Management, in conjunction with its actuaries,
    reviewed anticipated future long-term performance of individual
    asset categories and considered the asset allocation strategy
    adopted by the Company

and/or

the
    trustees of the plans. While the review considered recent fund
    performance and historical returns, the assumption is primarily
    a long-term prospective rate.

The Company’s investment strategy is based on an
    expectation that equity securities will outperform debt
    securities over the long term. Accordingly, in order to maximize
    the return on assets, a majority of assets are invested in
    equities. Investments within each asset class are diversified to
    reduce the impact of losses in single investments. The use of
    derivative instruments is permitted where appropriate and
    necessary to achieve overall investment policy objectives and
    asset class targets.

The Company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage
    targets and appropriate benchmarks for each significant asset
    class to obtain a prudent balance between return and risk. The
    interaction between plan assets and benefit obligations is
    periodically studied by the Company and its actuaries to assist
    in the establishment of strategic asset allocation targets.

The valuation allowances of $34.8 million and
    $50.4 million at October 29, 2011 and October 30,
    2010, respectively, are a valuation allowance for the
    Company’s state credit carryovers that began expiring in
    2008.

The Company has provided for potential liabilities due in the
    various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Judgment is
    required in determining the worldwide income tax expense
    provision. In the ordinary course of global business, there are
    many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax
    outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a
    consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related
    entities. Although the Company believes its estimates are
    reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome
    of these matters will not be different than that which is
    reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals.
    Such differences could have a material impact on the
    Company’s income tax provision and operating results in the
    period in which such determination is made.

As of October 29, 2011 and October 30, 2010, the
    Company had a liability of $9.7 million and
    $18.4 million, respectively, for gross unrealized tax
    benefits, all of which, if settled in the Company’s favor,
    would lower the Company’s effective tax rate in the period
    recorded. In addition, as of October 29, 2011 and
    October 30, 2010, the Company had a liability of
    approximately $11.1 million and $9.9 million,
    respectively, for interest and penalties. The Company includes
    interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits
    within the provision for taxes in the consolidated statements of
    income. The total liability as of October 29, 2011 and
    October 30, 2010 of $20.8 million and
    $28.3 million, respectively, for uncertain tax positions is
    classified as non-current, and is included in other non-current
    liabilities, because the Company believes that the ultimate
    payment or settlement of these liabilities may not occur within
    the next twelve months. The consolidated statements of income
    for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 include $0.9 million,
    $1.8 million and $1.7 million, respectively, of
    interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions.
    Over the next fiscal year, the Company anticipates the liability
    to be reduced by $5.2 million for a tax settlement payment
    and the possible expiration of income tax statute of limitations.

Fiscal
    Years 2004 and 2005 IRS Examination

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Internal Revenue
    Service (IRS) completed its field examination of the
    Company’s fiscal years 2004 and 2005. On January 2,
    2008, the IRS issued its report for fiscal 2004 and 2005, which
    included four proposed adjustments related to these two fiscal
    years that the Company protested to the IRS Appeals Office. Two
    of the unresolved matters were one-time issues that pertain to
    Section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code related to the
    beneficial tax treatment of dividends paid from foreign owned
    companies under The American Jobs Creation Act. The other
    matters pertained to the computation of the research and
    development (R&D) tax credit and certain profits earned
    from manufacturing activities carried on outside the United
    States. The Company recorded a tax liability for a portion of
    the proposed R&D tax credit adjustment. These four items
    had an additional potential tax liability of $46 million.
    The Company concluded, based on discussions with its tax
    advisors, that these items were not likely to result in any
    additional tax liability. Therefore, the Company did not record
    a tax liability for these items.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company reached
    settlement with the IRS Appeals Office on three of the four
    items under protest. The remaining unresolved matter is a
    one-time issue pertaining to Section 965 of the Internal
    Revenue Code related to the beneficial tax treatment of
    dividends from foreign owned companies under The American Jobs
    Creation Act. The Company will file a petition with the Tax
    Court with respect to this open matter. The potential liability
    for this adjustment is $36.5 million. The Company has
    concluded, based on discussions with its tax advisors, that this
    item is not likely to result in any additional tax liability.
    Therefore, the Company has not recorded any additional tax
    liability for this issue.

Fiscal
    Years 2006 and 2007 IRS Examination

During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, the IRS completed its
    field examination of the Company’s fiscal years 2006 and
    2007. The IRS and the Company agreed on the treatment of a
    number of issues that have been included in an Issue Resolutions
    Agreement related to the 2006 and 2007 tax returns. However, no
    agreement was reached on the tax treatment of a number of issues
    for the fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007 years, including the
    same R&D tax credit and foreign manufacturing issues
    mentioned above related to fiscal 2004 and 2005, the pricing of
    intercompany sales (transfer pricing) and the deductibility of
    certain stock option compensation expenses. The Company recorded
    taxes related to a portion of the proposed R&D tax credit
    adjustment. These four items had an additional potential total
    tax liability of $195 million. The Company concluded, based
    on discussions with its tax advisors that these items were not
    likely to result in any additional tax liability. Therefore, the
    Company did not record any additional tax liability for these
    items and appealed these proposed adjustments through the normal
    processes for the resolution of differences between the IRS and
    taxpayers.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company reached an
    agreement with the IRS Appeals Office on three of the four
    protested items, two of which were the same issues settled
    relating to the 2004 and 2005 fiscal years. Transfer pricing
    remained as the only item under protest with the IRS Appeals
    Office related to the fiscal


ANALOG
    DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

2006 and fiscal 2007 years. The potential U.S. tax
    liability for this matter would have been $157.5 million.
    The Company concluded, based on discussions with its tax
    advisors, that this item was not likely to result in any
    additional tax liability. Therefore, the Company did not record
    a tax liability for this issue.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company reached an
    agreement with the IRS Appeals Office on transfer pricing, the
    remaining item under protest related to the fiscal 2006 and
    fiscal 2007 years. Under this agreement, there is no tax
    owed on the transfer pricing issue for those years.

As a result of settling all but the one-time issue pertaining to
    Section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code related to the
    beneficial tax treatment of dividends from foreign owned
    companies under The American Jobs Creation Act for the fiscal
    2004 through fiscal 2007 years at the IRS Appeals Office, the
    Company recorded a net $10.8 million tax benefit in the
    second quarter of fiscal 2011. The Company will file a petition
    with the Tax Court for the open matter.

Fiscal
    Years 2008 through 2010

The Company files U.S. federal, U.S. state and

non-U.S. tax

returns. The following major jurisdictions are no longer subject
    to examination: U.S. federal prior to fiscal year 2008 and
    Ireland prior to fiscal year 2007.

Although the Company believes its estimates of income tax
    payable are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the
    Company will prevail in the matters raised and that the outcome
    of one or all of these matters will not be different than that
    which is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and
    accruals. The Company believes such differences would not have a
    material impact on the Company’s financial condition but
    could have a material impact on the Company’s income tax
    provision, operating results and operating cash flows in the
    period in which such matters are resolved as well as for
    subsequent years.

Revolving
    Credit Facility

As of October 29, 2011, the Company had
    $3,592.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and
    short-term investments, of which $1,170.5 million was held
    in the United States. The balance of the Company’s cash and
    cash equivalents and short-term investments was held outside the
    United States in various foreign subsidiaries. As the Company
    intends to reinvest certain of its foreign earnings
    indefinitely, this cash is not available to meet certain of the
    Company’s cash requirements in the United States, including
    for cash dividends and common stock repurchases. The Company
    entered into a five-year, $165 million unsecured revolving
    credit facility with certain institutional lenders in May 2008.
    To date, the Company has not borrowed under this credit facility
    but the Company may borrow in the future and use the proceeds
    for support of commercial paper issuance, stock repurchases,
    dividend payments, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working
    capital and other lawful corporate purposes. Any advances under
    this credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are
    equal to LIBOR plus a margin that is based on the Company’s
    leverage ratio. The terms of the facility impose restrictions on
    the Company’s ability to undertake certain transactions, to
    create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary
    indebtedness. The terms of this facility also include financial
    covenants that require the Company to maintain a minimum
    interest coverage ratio and not exceed a maximum leverage ratio.
    As of October 29, 2011, the Company was compliant with
    these covenants.

16.

Debt

On June 30, 2009, the Company issued $375 million
    aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notes
    due July 1, 2014 (the 5.0% Notes) with semi-annual
    fixed interest payments on January 1 and July 1 of each year,
    commencing January 1, 2010. The sale of the 5.0% Notes
    was made pursuant to the terms of an underwriting agreement
    dated June 25, 2009 between the Company and Credit Suisse
    Securities (USA) LLC, as representative of the several
    underwriters named therein. The net proceeds of the offering
    were $370.4 million, after issuing at a discount and
    deducting expenses, underwriting discounts and commissions,
    which will be amortized over the term of the 5.0% Notes.
    The indenture governing the 5.0% Notes contains covenants
    that may limit the Company’s ability to: incur, create,
    assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a
    lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease-back
    transactions with respect to a principal property; and
    consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or
    substantially all of its assets to, any other party. As of
    October 29, 2011, the

Company was compliant with these covenants. The notes are
    subordinated to any future secured debt and to the other
    liabilities of our subsidiaries.

On June 30, 2009, the Company entered into interest rate
    swap transactions where the Company swapped the notional amount
    of its $375 million of fixed rate debt at 5.0% into
    floating interest rate debt through July 1, 2014. Under the
    terms of the swaps, the Company will (i) receive on the
    $375 million notional amount a 5.0% annual interest payment
    that is paid in two installments on the 1st business day of
    every January and July, commencing January 1, 2010 through
    and ending on the maturity date; and (ii) pay on the
    $375 million notional amount an annual three month LIBOR
    plus 2.05% (2.42% as of October 29, 2011) interest
    payment, payable in four installments on the 1st business
    day of every January, April, July and October, commencing on
    October 1, 2009 and ending on the maturity date. The
    LIBOR-based rate is set quarterly three months prior to the date
    of the interest payment. The Company designated these swaps as
    fair value hedges. The changes in the fair value of the interest
    rate swaps were reflected in the carrying value of the interest
    rate swaps in other assets on the balance sheet. The carrying
    value of the debt on the balance sheet was adjusted by an equal
    and offsetting amount.

On December 22, 2010, Analog Devices Holdings B.V., a
    wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a credit
    agreement with Bank of America, N.A., London Branch as
    administrative agent. The borrower’s obligations are
    guaranteed by the Company. The credit agreement provides for a
    term loan facility of $145 million, which matures on
    December 22, 2013. The terms of the agreement provide for a
    three year principle amortization schedule with
    $3.6 million payable quarterly every March, June, September
    and December with the balance payable upon the maturity date.
    During the third quarter of fiscal 2011 the Company made an
    additional principal payment of $17.5 million. The loan
    will bear interest at a fluctuating rate for each period equal
    to the LIBOR rate corresponding with the tenor of the interest
    period plus a spread of 1.25% (1.61% as of October 29,
    2011). The terms of this facility include limitations on
    subsidiary indebtedness and on liens against the assets of the
    Company and its subsidiaries, and also include financial
    covenants that require the Company to maintain a minimum
    interest coverage ratio and not exceed a maximum leverage ratio.
    As of October 29, 2011, the Company was compliant with
    these covenants. As of October 29, 2011, $14.5 million
    of this debt was classified as short-term.

On April 4, 2011, the Company issued $375 million
    aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes
    due April 15, 2016 (the 3.0% Notes) with semi-annual
    fixed interest payments due on April 15 and October 15 of each
    year, commencing October 15, 2011. The sale of the
    3.0% Notes was made pursuant to the terms of an
    underwriting agreement dated March 30, 2011 between the
    Company and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Merrill
    Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, as representative
    of the several underwriters named therein. The net proceeds of
    the offering were $370.5 million, after issuing at a
    discount and deducting expenses, underwriting discounts and
    commissions, which will be amortized over the term of the
    3.0% Notes. The indenture governing the 3.0% Notes
    contains covenants that may limit the Company’s ability to:
    incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money
    secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and
    lease-back transactions with respect to a principal property;
    and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or
    substantially all of its assets to, any other party. As of
    October 29, 2011, the Company was compliant with these
    covenants. The notes are subordinated to any future secured debt
    and to the other liabilities of our subsidiaries.

The Company’s principle payments related to its long-term
    debt obligations are as follows: $14.5 million in fiscal
    years 2012 and 2013; $462.6 million in fiscal year 2014;
    and $375 million in fiscal year 2016.

    December 2, 2011.


REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Analog Devices, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Analog Devices, Inc. as of October 29, 2011 and
    October 30, 2010, and the related consolidated statements
    of income, shareholders’ equity, comprehensive income, and
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    October 29, 2011. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(b). These
    financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Analog Devices, Inc. at October 29,
    2011 and October 30, 2010, and the consolidated results of
    its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended October 29, 2011, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
    information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Analog Devices, Inc.’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of October 29, 2011, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated November 22, 2011 expressed
    an unqualified opinion thereon.

    FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

Not applicable.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

(a)

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
    Procedures.

Our management, with the
    participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of Analog’s disclosure
    controls and procedures as of October 29, 2011. The term
    “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures
    of a company that are designed to ensure that information
    required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it
    files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
    the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
    procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
    designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
    a company in the reports that it files or submits under the
    Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
    company’s management, including its principal executive and
    principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely
    decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes
    that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
    and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
    their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment
    in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
    and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures as of October 29, 2011, our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as
    of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were
    effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal
    control over financial reporting is defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

or

15d-15(f)

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers and effected by the company’s board of directors,
    management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
    regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
    preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
    includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of the company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
    that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
    only in accordance with authorizations of management and
    directors of the company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
    are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting as of October 29, 2011. In
    making this assessment, the company’s management used the
    criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
    of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated
    Framework.

Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of
    October 29, 2011, our internal control over financial
    reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Our independent registered public accounting firm that audited
    the financial statements included in this annual report has
    issued an attestation report on our internal control over
    financial reporting. This report appears below.

(c)

Attestation Report of the Registered Public
    Accounting Firm


REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Analog Devices, Inc.

We have audited Analog Devices, Inc.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of October 29, 2011, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Analog Devices,
    Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Analog Devices, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of October 29, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Analog Devices, Inc. as of
    October 29, 2011 and October 30, 2010, and the related
    consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity,
    comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years
    in the period ended October 29, 2011 of Analog Devices,
    Inc. and our report dated November 22, 2011 expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

    Reporting.

    financial reporting (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal
    quarter ended October 29, 2011 that has materially
    affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
    internal control over financial reporting.
