PART I

ITEM
1.     BUSINESS

Company Overview

We are a leader in the design, manufacture and
marketing of high-performance analog, mixed-signal and digital
signal processing integrated circuits. Since our inception in
1965, we have focused on solving the engineering challenges
associated with signal processing in electronic equipment. Our
products play a fundamental role in converting real-world
phenomena such as temperature, motion, pressure, light and sound
into electrical signals to be used in a wide array of electronic
equipment ranging from industrial process control, factory
automation systems equipment, smart munitions, base stations,
central office equipment, wireless telephones, computers, cars,
CAT scanners, digital cameras and DVD players.

Signal processing is the cornerstone of
high-speed communications, digital entertainment, and other
consumer, computer and industrial applications. As new
generations of digital applications evolve, they generate new
needs for high-performance analog and digital signal processing,
or DSP, technology. Signal processing is where the analog and
digital worlds meet to provide the advantages of digital
technology to the real world.

We produce a wide range of products that are
designed to meet the technology needs of a broad base of
customers. Markets for our products include communications,
computers and computer peripherals, consumer electronics and
industrial instrumentation.

During fiscal 2002, approximately 40% of our
revenue came from the industrial market, which includes factory
automation, medical equipment, scientific instrumentation,
automatic test equipment and aerospace and defense systems.

Revenues from the communications market
represented approximately one-third of our fiscal 2002 revenues.
Communications applications include wireless handsets and base
stations, as well as products used for high-speed access to the
Internet, including broadband modems and central office
networking equipment.

We also serve the personal computer market with
products that monitor and manage power usage, process signals
used in flat panel displays and multimedia projectors and enable
CD-quality audio. In fiscal 2002, the computer market accounted
for approximately 15% of our revenue.

The demand for our products in high-performance
consumer electronics has been increasing and reached
approximately 10% of our revenue during fiscal 2002.
Applications in this market include digital cameras and
camcorders, DVD players, digital televisions and surround sound
audio systems.

We sell our products worldwide through a direct
sales force, third-party distributors and independent sales
representatives. We have direct sales offices in
18 countries, including the United States.

We are headquartered near Boston, in Norwood,
Massachusetts, and have manufacturing facilities in
Massachusetts, California, North Carolina, Ireland, the United
Kingdom, the Philippines and Taiwan. We were founded in 1965 and
are incorporated in Massachusetts. As of November 2, 2002,
we employed approximately 8,600 people worldwide. Our common
stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol
ADI and is included in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index.

We maintain a website with the address
www.analog.com. We are not including the information contained
on our website as a part of, or incorporating it by reference
into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make available
free of charge through our website our Annual Reports on
Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current
Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports, as
soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such
material with, or furnish such material to, the Securities and
Exchange Commission. In addition, we intend to disclose on our
website any amendments to, or waivers from, our code of business
conduct and ethics that are required to be publicly disclosed
pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.



Industry Background

All electronic signals fall into one of two
categories, analog or digital. Analog, also known as linear,
signals represent real-world phenomena, such as temperature,
pressure, sound, speed and acceleration. This information can be
detected and measured using analog sensors, which represent
real-world phenomena by generating continuously-varying voltages
and currents. The signals from these sensors are initially
processed using analog methods, such as amplification, filtering
and shaping. They are then usually converted to digital form for
storage or further manipulation. The further manipulation of the
signals after conversion to digital form is called “digital
signal processing.” Digital signals represent the
“ones” and “zeros” of binary arithmetic and
are either on or off. Digital signals are frequently converted
back to analog form for functions such as video display, audio
output or control. These manipulations and transformations from
analog to digital and back to analog are known as
“real-world signal processing” within the signal chain.

Significant advances in semiconductor technology
in recent years have substantially increased the performance and
functionality of ICs used in signal processing applications.
These advances include the ability to combine analog and digital
signal processing capability on a single chip, thereby making
possible more highly-integrated solutions. The widespread
application of low-cost microprocessor-based systems and of
digital communication technologies has increased the need for
signal conditioning interfaces between the analog and digital
world. At the same time, the convergence of computing and
communications has resulted in end products that incorporate
state-of-the-art signal processing capability onto as few chips
as possible. Our products are designed to be used within
electronic equipment to achieve higher performance, including
greater speed, improved accuracy, more efficient signal
processing and minimized power consumption.

Principal Products

We design, manufacture and market a broad line of
high-performance ICs that incorporate analog, mixed-signal and
digital signal processing technologies. Our ICs are designed to
address a wide range of real-world signal processing
applications. Across the entire range of our signal processing
ICs are both general purpose products as well as custom products
designed for specific applications and customers. By using
readily available, high-performance, general-purpose products in
their systems, our customers can reduce the time they need to
bring new products to market. Given the high cost of developing
customized ICs, our standard products often provide the most
cost-effective solution for many low to medium volume
applications. In many emerging markets, including
communications, computer and consumer products, we focus on
working with leading customers to design application-specific
solutions. We begin with our existing core technologies in
analog, DSP and mixed-signal, and devise a solution to more
closely meet the needs of a specific customer or group of
customers. Because we have already developed the core technology
for our general-purpose products, we can create
application-specific solutions quickly.

We produce and market several thousand products.
Our highest revenue product accounted for approximately 2% of
our revenue for fiscal 2002. Approximately 80% of our products
are proprietary and equivalent products are not available. Only
a limited number of other companies may provide products with
similar function.

Analog Products

Our analog IC technology has been the foundation
of our business for more than 30 years, and we believe we
are one of the world’s largest suppliers of analog ICs. Our
analog ICs are primarily high-performance, single-function
devices. The majority of our analog IC product revenue is
attributable to sales of data converters and amplifiers. The
data converters and amplifiers product categories accounted for
55% of our fiscal 2002 revenues. Other analog IC products
include analog signal processing devices such as analog
multipliers, voltage references and comparators. Over the past
few years we have been expanding our analog IC product offerings
along the entire analog signal chain and into product areas such
as radio frequency integrated circuits, or RF ICs, and power and
thermal monitoring ICs. We are also expanding our analog IC
product line to better meet the needs of customers designing
portable battery-operated equipment.



Our analog IC products tend to be proprietary to
us in their design and general purpose in their application.
This allows customers to incorporate our products into a wide
variety of electronic equipment and systems. Our product
portfolio includes several thousand analog ICs, any one of which
can have as many as several hundred customers. Our analog ICs
typically have long product life cycles. Our analog IC customers
include both original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and
customers who build electronic subsystems for integration into
larger systems. Most of our analog ICs have been purchased by
OEMs to serve the industrial, instrumentation, defense/
aerospace and automotive markets, but during the past few years
they have been increasingly used for applications in
communications, computers and other consumer applications
requiring high-performance real-world signal processing. The
principal requirements these applications have in common include
higher accuracy, lower cost per function, smaller size, lower
weight and fewer components for improved reliability.

Our analog technology base also includes products
using an advanced IC technology known in the industry as surface
micromachining, which is used to produce semiconductor products
known as micro-electromechanical systems, or MEMS. This
technology enables extremely small mechanical structures to be
built on the surface of a chip along with supporting circuitry.
In addition to incorporating an electro-mechanical structure,
these devices also have analog circuitry for conditioning
signals obtained from the sensing element. Our MEMS products are
known as accelerometers and are used to monitor acceleration in
a wide variety of applications. The majority of our current
revenue from micromachined products is derived from
accelerometers used by automotive manufacturers in airbag
applications. Recently, we have combined our MEMS technology
with silicon-on-insulator, or SOI, technology we obtained
through the acquisition of BCO Technologies plc in fiscal 2000.
SOI technology creates multiple layers of silicon as a single
substrate. Our next generation of inertial sensors for the
airbag market will incorporate both SOI and MEMS technology. SOI
MEMS is a process where one layer is used for the MEMS device
and the other layer is used for the circuitry. Emerging
applications include global positioning satellite automobile
navigation systems, earthquake detectors and high-end computer
joysticks. We have recently introduced a MEMS gyroscope that
could have applications in automobiles, industrial robotics and
various navigation applications.

DSP Products

DSPs are processors or microcomputers that are
optimized for high-speed numeric processing, which is essential
for real-time processing of digital data representing analog
signals. Our DSP products are designed to be fully programmable
and to efficiently execute specialized software programs, or
algorithms, associated with processing digitized real-time,
real-world data. Programmable DSPs provide the flexibility to
modify the device’s function quickly and inexpensively in
software. We offer both general-purpose and application-specific
DSP products. General-purpose DSP IC customers typically write
their own algorithms using software tools that we provide and
software tools they obtain from third-party suppliers. Our
application-specific DSP products typically include analog and
DSP technology and the DSPs are preprogrammed to execute
software for applications such as wireless telecommunications or
image processing. Our DSPs are designed in families of products
that share a common architecture and therefore can execute the
same software. We support these products with specialized
applications and easy-to-use, low-cost development tools, which
reduce product development costs and time-to-market.

Mixed-Signal Products

Our products also include multi-function
mixed-signal devices and chipsets that incorporate combinations
of analog and DSP technology. The growing technological demands
associated with the use of audio and video in computers and
consumer products as well as the networking of communications
systems has created new opportunities for these mixed-signal
products. Examples of these products include chipsets for
communication applications such as global system for mobile
cellular phones, cable modems, and broadband modems. Other
examples include audio input/output devices for computer
applications and electric motor control devices for industrial
instrumentation.



Markets and Applications

The following describes some of the
characteristics of, and products supplied to, our major markets:

Industrial

—
Our industrial market includes the following areas:

Industrial Process
Automation

— Our industrial
process automation market includes data acquisition systems,
automatic process control systems, robotics, environmental
control systems and automatic test equipment. These products
generally require ICs that offer performance greater than that
available from commodity-level ICs, but generally do not have
production volumes that warrant custom or application-specific
ICs. Combinations of analog and mixed-signal ICs are usually
employed to achieve the necessary functionality. Automatic test
equipment applications have created opportunities for the design
of system-level ICs that require a high level of electronic
circuitry.

Instrumentation

—
Our instrumentation market includes engineering, medical and
scientific instruments. These products are usually designed
using the highest performance analog and mixed-signal ICs
available.

Military/
Aerospace

— The military,
commercial avionics and space markets all require
high-performance ICs that meet rigorous environmental and
reliability specifications. Many of our analog ICs can be
supplied in versions that meet appropriate military standards.
In addition, many products can be supplied to meet the standards
required for broadcast satellites and other commercial space
applications. Most of our products sold in this market are
specifically-tested versions of products derived from our
standard product offering.

Automotive

—
Although the automotive market has historically been served with
low-cost, low-performance ICs, demand has emerged for higher
performance devices for a wide range of applications. In
response, we are developing products specifically for the
automotive market. We supply a micromachined IC used as a crash
sensor in airbag systems, which serves as an alternative to an
electromechanical sensor. We believe that other micromachined
devices derived from this product may be suitable for other
automotive applications, such as roll-over sensing, global
positioning satellite, or GPS, automotive navigation systems,
anti-lock brakes and “smart” suspension systems and
non-automotive applications including earthquake detectors and
high-end computer joysticks.

Communications

—
The development of broadband, wireless and Internet
infrastructures around the world has created an important market
for our communications products. Communications technology
involves the acquisition of analog signals that are converted
from analog to digital and digital to analog form as they are
processed and transmitted. Our expertise in combining analog and
digital functionality on a single chip or chip set has enabled
us to develop products that address the technological challenges
of this complex and rapidly expanding market space. The need for
higher speed and reduced power consumption, coupled with more
reliable, bandwidth-efficient communications, has been creating
demand for our products, which are used in systems that include
digital, analog and mixed-signal processing capability. Our
products are used in the full spectrum of signal processing for
audio, data, image or video communication. In broadband and
wireless communication applications, our products are
incorporated into data and digital subscriber line, or DSL,
modems, cellular telephones, base station equipment and remote
access servers.

Computers and Computer
Peripherals

— Increased
interface between users and PCs through monitors, printers,
scanners and audio devices and the increasing need for power and
thermal management capability in PCs have provided opportunities
in the computer market. Our ability to integrate analog, DSP and
mixed-signal functionality on ICs has enabled us to supply many
high-performance critical components required by PC
manufacturers. The computer industry seeks to develop and market
ever smaller and lighter personal computers. This need increases
demand for high- performance ICs to monitor power usage to
enable manufacturers to use smaller batteries and extend battery
life between charges. We currently supply a variety of ICs used
in this market for functions such as graphic displays,
interfaces between PCs and peripherals such as modems and
printers, power and battery management, and enhanced audio input
and output capability for business and entertainment
applications.



Consumer
Electronics

— Increased
market demand from digital entertainment systems for
acquisition, display and digital processing of signals has
allowed us to combine analog and digital design capability to
provide solutions that are designed to meet the rigorous cost,
size and reliability constraints of the consumer electronics
market. The emergence of high-performance, feature-rich consumer
products, such as home theater systems, video projectors, DVD
players and digital camcorders and cameras, has led to the need
for high-performance, system-level ICs with a high level of
specific functionality.

Research and Development

Our markets are characterized by rapid
technological changes and advances. Accordingly, we make
substantial investments in the design and development of new
products and processes, and for improving existing products and
processes. We spent approximately $424 million during
fiscal 2002 on the design, development and improvement of new
and existing products and processes, compared to approximately
$465 million during fiscal 2001 and approximately
$390 million during fiscal 2000.

Our R&D strategy focuses on building
technical leadership in core technologies for signal
conditioning, conversion and processing. In support of our
research and development activities, we employ thousands of
engineers involved in product and process development at over 30
design centers and manufacturing sites located throughout the
world.

Patents and Other Intellectual Property
Rights

As of November 2, 2002, we held 704 United
States patents and had 446 patent applications pending with the
United States Patent and Trademark Office with expiration dates
ranging from 2002 through 2022. We believe that while our
patents may provide some advantage, our competitive position is
largely determined by such factors as the system and application
knowledge, ability and experience of our personnel, the range
and number of new products being developed by us, our market
brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts, customer
service and technical support. It is generally our policy to
seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be
patented, though we may elect, in certain cases, not to seek
patent protection even for significant inventions, if other
protection, such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret,
is considered more advantageous. We also have trademarks that
are used in the conduct of our business. These trademarks are
valuable assets. In addition, we have registered certain of our
mask sets under the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984.

There can be no assurance that any patent will
issue on pending applications or that any patent issued will
provide substantive protection for the technology or product
covered by it. There also can be no assurance that others will
not develop or patent similar technology or reverse engineer our
products or that our confidentiality agreements with employees,
consultants, silicon foundries and other suppliers and vendors
will be adequate to protect our interests. Moreover, the laws of
countries in which we design, manufacture and market our
products may afford little or no effective protection of our
proprietary technology.

The semiconductor industry is characterized by
frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other
intellectual property rights, including claims arising under our
contractual indemnification of our customers. We have received
from time to time, and may receive in the future, claims from
third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe
their patents or other intellectual property rights. In the
event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim
against us and a license is not available to us on commercially
reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to
redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that
intellectual property, and our operating results could be
materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary
to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property
rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this
litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key
personnel. See Note 11 in the Notes to our Consolidated
Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K for information concerning pending
litigation that involves us. An adverse outcome in this or other
litigation could have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results
of operations or cash flows in the period in which the
litigation is resolved.



Sales Channels

We sell our products in North America and
internationally through a direct sales force, third-party
distributors and independent sales representatives.
Approximately 30% of our fiscal 2002 net sales were to customers
in North America. As of December 1, 2002, we had
13 sales offices in the United States, and our third-party
distribution channel consisted of six national and regional
third-party distributors and several independent sales
representatives in numerous locations throughout the United
States and Canada.

Approximately 21% of our fiscal 2002 net sales
were to customers in Europe, 17% to customers in Japan, and 32%
to customers in other international markets. As of
December 1, 2002, we had direct sales offices in Austria,
Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India,
Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Singapore, Sweden,
Taiwan and the United Kingdom. We also had sales representatives
and/or distributors in approximately 45 countries outside North
America, including countries where we also have direct sales
offices. For further detail regarding financial information
about geographic areas, see Note 4 in the Notes to our
Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

A significant portion of our fiscal 2002 revenue
was derived from sales made through distributors. Revenue is
deferred on sales made through distributors until the
distributors resell the products to the end users. These
distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products.
Some of them also sell products competitive with our products,
including those for which we are an alternate source. Sales to
certain distributors are made under agreements that provide
protection to the distributors for their inventory of our
products against price reductions and products that are
slow-moving or that we have discontinued, including limited
product return privileges.

Our worldwide technical direct field sales
efforts are supported by an extensive promotional program that
includes editorial coverage and paid advertising in trade
publications, direct mail programs, promotional brochures,
technical seminars and participation in trade shows. We publish
and distribute full-length databooks, short-form catalogs,
applications guides, technical handbooks and detailed data
sheets for individual products. We also provide product and
application information and sell products via our worldwide
website on the Internet. We maintain a staff of field
application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our
products into their products during their product development
cycles.

We have thousands of customers worldwide. Our
largest single customer represented approximately 3% of net
sales for fiscal 2002, and our 20 largest customers accounted
for approximately 27% of our net sales in fiscal 2002.

See Note 4 “Industry and Geographic Segment
Information” of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial
Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Foreign Operations

Through subsidiaries and affiliates, we conduct
business in numerous countries outside the United States. Our
international business is subject to risks customarily
encountered in foreign operations, including fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates and controls, import and export
controls, and other laws, policies and regulations of foreign
governments.

During fiscal 2002, approximately 70% of our
revenues were derived from customers in international markets.
We have manufacturing facilities outside the United States in
Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Philippines and Taiwan. In
addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the
semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic and
political risks inherent in international operations and their
impact on the United States economy in general, including the
risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and
economic instability in many countries around the world as well
as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism, particularly
in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11,
2001 and the response to them by the United States and its
allies. These risks include air transportation disruptions,
expropriation, currency controls and changes in currency
exchange rates, tax and tariff rates and freight rates, and
social and political unrest. Although we engage in hedging
transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate



fluctuations, there can be no assurance that our
competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes
in the exchange rate of the United States dollar against other
currencies.

Production and Raw Materials

Monolithic integrated circuit components are
manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps
that include wafer fabrication, wafer testing, cutting the wafer
into individual “chips,” or dice, assembly of the dice
into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final
packaged form. The raw materials used to manufacture these
devices include silicon wafers, processing chemicals (including
liquefied gases), precious metals, ceramic packages and plastic
used for packaging.

We develop and employ a wide variety of
proprietary processes that are specifically tailored for use in
fabricating high-performance linear, mixed-signal and
micromachined ICs. We also use industry-standard bipolar and
CMOS wafer fabrication processes.

Our IC products are fabricated both at our
production facilities and by third-party wafer fabricators. Most
of our analog products are manufactured in our own wafer
fabrication facilities using proprietary processes. Our DSP
products, and a portion of our analog products, are manufactured
at third-party foundries using sub-micron digital CMOS
processes. We operate wafer fabrication facilities in Wilmington
and Cambridge, Massachusetts; Santa Clara and Sunnyvale,
California; Belfast, Northern Ireland and Limerick, Ireland. We
also operate assembly and test facilities located in the
Philippines and Taiwan and use third-party subcontractors.

Some of our assembled products are assembled and
tested within our U.S. manufacturing facilities, while others
are assembled and tested at our facilities outside the United
States or by subcontractors, principally in the Far East.

To respond to production capacity requirements,
we significantly expanded our analog manufacturing capacity over
the past several years. Much of the capacity expansion was
completed by the end of fiscal 2001 when we incurred
$297 million of capital spending. In the two years prior to
fiscal 2002, major wafer fabrication expansions were completed
in Wilmington, Massachusetts, Sunnyvale, California, and
Limerick, Ireland. In fiscal 2001, we completed construction of
an additional assembly and test facility in Cavite, Philippines
and have transferred substantially all of our test operations to
that location. In the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we
announced that we would transition products from our three older
four-inch wafer fabrication facilities to our three six-inch and
one eight-inch wafer fabrication facilities. The transition of
products from and closure of our four-inch wafer fabrication
facilities is expected to be completed by mid-fiscal 2003.
Capital spending in fiscal 2002 was $57 million, down
substantially from the $297 million incurred in fiscal 2001
because of the slowdown in our served markets. We currently plan
to make capital expenditures of approximately $80 million
in fiscal 2003, and capital expenditures are expected to remain
low, as we believe we currently have ample installed capacity to
significantly increase internal production levels.

Our products require a wide variety of
components, most of which we purchase from third-party
suppliers. We have multiple sources for the majority of the
components and materials we purchase and incorporate into our
products. However, in some cases, we purchase these components
from sole-source suppliers, such as with components we purchase
from external foundries. If these sole-source suppliers are
unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient
quantities of components to us, on the time schedule and of the
quality that we require, we may be forced to seek to engage
additional or replacement suppliers, which could result in
additional expenses and delays in product development or
shipment of product to our customers. Although we have
experienced shortages of components from time to time, these
items have generally been available to us as needed.

Backlog

Backlog at the end of fiscal 2002 was
approximately $262 million, up from approximately
$210 million at the end of fiscal 2001. We define backlog
as of a particular date as firm orders with a customer requested
delivery date within thirteen weeks. Backlog is impacted by the
tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead



times available from suppliers, including us, in
periods of depressed demand. In periods of increased demand,
there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the
effect of increasing backlog and, in some instances, we may not
have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders. As
is customary in the semiconductor industry, we allow orders to
be canceled or deliveries delayed by customers without penalty.
Accordingly, we believe that our backlog at any time should not
be used as an indication of our future revenues.

Government Contracts

We estimate that approximately 5% of our fiscal
2002 total worldwide revenue was attributable to sales to the
U.S. government and government contractors and subcontractors.
Our government contract business is predominantly in the form of
negotiated, firm fixed-price subcontracts. All such contracts
and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to
termination at the election of the United States government.

Competition

We compete with a number of semiconductor
companies in markets that are highly competitive. We believe we
are one of the largest suppliers of high-performance
mixed-signal and linear signal processing components.
Competitors for our analog, mixed-signal and DSP products
include Cirrus Logic Inc., Linear Technology Corporation, Maxim
Integrated Products, Inc., National Semiconductor Corporation,
Phillips Semiconductor, ST Microelectronics and Texas
Instruments, Inc. Sales of our micromachined products are
currently comprised of acceleration sensors, and our main
competitors in that market are Bosch, Motorola and Denso, all of
whom use a multichip solution. We use a single chip solution
that we believe provides cost, reliability and functional
advantages in the marketplace.

We believe that competitive performance in the
marketplace for real-world signal processing components depends
upon several factors, including technical innovation, product
quality and reliability, range of products, product price,
customer service and technical support. We believe our technical
innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability,
supported by our commitment to strong customer service and
technical support, enables us to compete in our chosen markets
against both foreign and domestic semiconductor manufacturers.

Many other companies offer products that compete
with our products. Some also offer other electronic products,
and some have greater financial, manufacturing, technical and
marketing resources than we have. Additionally, some
formerly-independent competitors have been purchased by larger
companies. Our competitors also include emerging companies
selling specialized products to markets we serve. There can be
no assurances that we will be able to compete successfully in
the future against existing or new competitors, or that our
operating results will not be adversely affected by increased
price competition.

Environment

Our manufacturing facilities are subject to
numerous environmental laws and regulations, particularly with
respect to industrial waste and emissions. Compliance with these
laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our
capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

We are committed to protecting the environment
and the health and safety of our employees, customers, and the
public. We endeavor to adhere to the most stringent standards
across all of our facilities, to encourage pollution prevention,
and to strive towards continual improvement. We strive to exceed
compliance with regulatory standards in order to achieve a
standard of excellence in environmental, health and safety
management practices, as an integral part of our total quality
management system.

Employees

As of November 2, 2002, we employed
approximately 8,600 persons. Our future success depends in large
part on the continued service of our key technical and senior
management personnel, and on our ability to continue to attract,
retain and motivate qualified employees, particularly those
highly skilled design, process and test engineers involved in
the manufacture of existing products and the development of new
products and processes. The competition for such personnel is
intense, and the loss of key employees could have a material
adverse effect on us. We believe that relations with our
employees are good.



ITEM
2.     PROPERTIES

Our corporate headquarters is located in Norwood,
Massachusetts. Manufacturing and other operations are conducted
in several locations worldwide. The following tables provide
certain information about our principal general offices and
manufacturing facilities:



In addition to the principal leased properties
listed in the previous table, we also lease sales offices and
other premises at 28 locations in the United States and
48 locations overseas under operating lease agreements.
These leases expire at various dates through the year 2020. We
do not anticipate experiencing significant difficulty in
retaining occupancy of any of our manufacturing, office or sales
facilities through lease renewals prior to expiration or through
month-to-month occupancy, or in replacing them with equivalent
facilities. For information concerning our obligations under all
operating leases see Note 10 in the Notes to our
Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

ITEM 3.     LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS

We are a defendant in a federal lawsuit brought
in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California by Linear Technology Corporation, or LTC. On
June 26, 1997, LTC filed suit against us, Impala Linear
Corporation, Toyoda Automatic Loom Works, Ltd., Maxim Integrated
Products, Inc. and Unitrode Corporation alleging patent
infringement and seeking injunctive relief and unspecified
damages. The case was originally scheduled for trial on
liability issues beginning on September 7, 1999. The
original district judge recused himself and the case was
reassigned three times before the court granted several motions
for summary judgment of non-infringement in favor of the
defendants in September 2001. The court also denied LTC’s
motion for summary judgment of infringement and willful
infringement against us. On October 4, 2001, the court
indicated that it would stay the matter and certify similar
issues as to us to allow all parties to take appeals to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or
Federal Circuit. LTC, Maxim and Unitrode filed cross appeals
with the Federal Circuit. On November 1, 2001, LTC and we
jointly petitioned the Federal Circuit to permit them to address
the issues certified for appeal. On February 15, 2002, the
Federal Circuit dismissed all of the appeals due to improper
certification and denied the petition of LTC and us for
permission to appeal. On June 4, 2002, LTC and we filed a
stipulation of dismissal and proposed order dismissing all of
LTC’s claims against us without prejudice. The judge issued
an order on June 6, 2002, dismissing the case against us
without prejudice. While the renewed appeals of the other
defendants include a challenge to the propriety of the dismissal
of us being without prejudice, this matter is formally concluded
as to us.

On June 17, 2002, we received a letter from
Plasma Physics Corporation, or Plasma Physics, attaching a
courtesy copy of a complaint they had filed against us in the
Eastern District of New York alleging infringement by certain of
our products of two patents held by Plasma Physics. In the
letter, Plasma Physics indicated that they would like to license
the patents to us. The letter further stated that Plasma Physics
would forego service of the complaint for a period of
120 days, provided that we would agree to undertake
negotiations over terms for licensing the above-referenced
patents. We met with Plasma Physics, and those negotiations are
ongoing. On October 17, 2002, Plasma Physics served the
complaint. We have answered the complaint denying the
allegations, and the litigation is in its early stages.

On October 7, 2002, Townshend Intellectual
Property, L.L.C., or Townshend, commenced an action in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of
California against us, alleging that we infringed eight patents
alleged to be owned by Townshend. Townshend’s complaint
alleges that our standalone embedded modems and single chip
internet modems infringe those patents. The complaint seeks
injunctive relief and unspecified damages. By letter dated
October 16, 2002, we sought indemnification from Lucent
Technologies, Inc. Lucent has denied that it has any
indemnification obligations to us. We filed an answer to the
complaint with the court, on or about December 12, 2002,
denying infringement and liability. We continue to evaluate
issues with regard to defenses and counterclaims, as well as
indemnification issues with respect to Lucent.

From time to time as a normal incidence of the
nature of our business, various claims, charges and litigation
are asserted or commenced against us arising from, or related
to, contractual matters, patents, trademarks, personal injury,
environmental matters, product liability, insurance coverage and
personnel and employment disputes. As to such claims and
litigation, including those items discussed above, we can give
no assurance that we will prevail. However, we do not believe
that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position, although an adverse outcome of
any of these matters could have a



material adverse effect on our consolidated
results of operations or cash flows in the quarter, or annual
period in which one or more of these matters are resolved.

FINANCIAL DATA



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
    FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations

Fiscal
Year 2002 Overview

Fiscal 2002 was a challenging year for us. We
recorded quarterly revenues of $806 million in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2000, which represented the peak of the
current cycle. Our revenues then declined significantly to
$393 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. We then
experienced a gradual sequential recovery for the last three
quarters of fiscal 2002, with our fiscal 2002 fourth quarter
revenue reaching $456 million. Our gross margins remained
strong at 53% for fiscal 2002. Operating expenses declined by
almost 9% as a result of cost containment measures throughout
our company. Our cash flow continued to be strong, with cash
increasing by over $100 million during fiscal 2002 to
$2,900 million after purchasing approximately $100 million
of our common stock.

Sales

Net sales were $1,708 million in fiscal
2002, a decrease of 25% from net sales of $2,277 million in
fiscal 2001. Approximately 80% of our net sales in both fiscal
2002 and fiscal 2001 were from analog products, which decreased
26% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 and decreased 4% from fiscal
2000 to fiscal 2001. DSP product sales represented the remaining
20% of our net sales in both fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 and
decreased 22% in fiscal 2002 after declining 33% in fiscal 2001.
The decreases in net sales in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 were
attributable to declining demand in several markets that we
serve, particularly the communications market, as well as an
overall decline in the general economy. Sales of new products,
which we define as sales of products introduced in the prior six
quarters, were 21% of net sales in fiscal 2002 as compared to
19% in fiscal 2001. The year-over-year increase in new products
as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the introduction
of record numbers of new analog IC products throughout the
economic downturn experienced over the past two years.

Net sales were $2,277 million in fiscal
2001, a decrease of 12% from net sales of $2,578 million in
fiscal 2000. This decrease in net sales was attributable to
declining demand in the markets we serve, particularly the
communications market, as well as an overall decline in the
general economy. Sales of new products were 19% of net sales in
fiscal 2001 as compared to 25% in fiscal 2000. The year over
year decrease in new products as a percentage of sales was
primarily due to the sharp downturn in sales of our
communications products.

The percentage of sales by geographic region,
based upon point of sale, for the last three years is as follows:

The fiscal 2002 decline in North American sales
as a percentage of total net sales was principally attributable
to an overall decline in the communications market, a cyclical
downturn in the semiconductor industry as well as the ongoing
transfer of customer manufacturing activity to lower cost
locations, primarily Southeast Asia. Sales in fiscal 2002 to
Japan increased slightly from fiscal 2001 as a percentage of net
sales but declined by 15% in dollars. Fiscal 2002 sales to
Southeast Asia increased as a percentage of net sales by 10% as
compared to fiscal 2001 while increasing approximately 9% in
dollars. In dollars, fiscal 2001 net sales decreased over fiscal
2000 by 23% in North America, 3% in Japan and 13% in Southeast
Asia and increased over fiscal 2000 by 10% in Europe.



Gross
Margin

Fiscal 2002 gross margin was $905 million,
or 53% of net sales, down 270 basis points from fiscal 2001
gross margin of $1,269 million, or 55.7% of net sales.
Gross margin decreased to 55.7% in fiscal 2001 from the 56.7%
achieved in fiscal 2000. The decline in year-over-year gross
margin for both fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 was primarily due to
reduced revenue levels and lower utilization of our internal
wafer fabrication facilities. Gross margin increased to 53.2% in
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 from 51.9% in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2001. The gross margin improvement through
fiscal 2002 was caused by a steady quarterly sales increase from
the second quarter of fiscal 2002, combined with tight spending
controls and the impact of manufacturing restructuring actions.
We decided that we had the opportunity to use this downturn to
fundamentally and permanently reduce our manufacturing
infrastructure costs worldwide. In the second quarter of fiscal
2002, we announced that we would transition products from our
older four-inch wafer fabrication facilities to our six-inch and
eight-inch wafer fabrication facilities that were then operating
well below capacity. As a result, the remaining service lives of
certain assets within our wafer fabrication facilities were
shortened. Depreciation expense included in cost of sales
included additional depreciation of approximately
$8.7 million in fiscal 2002 associated with the shortened
lives of some equipment in our older four-inch wafer fabrication
facilities.

Research
and Development

Research and development, or R&D, expenses
amounted to $424 million in fiscal 2002, a decrease of
$41 million from the $465 million recorded in fiscal
2001. Included in fiscal 2002 expense is approximately
$13.8 million of acquisition-related expenses compared to
approximately $8.2 million in fiscal 2001. The increase in
acquisition-related expense in fiscal 2002 was attributable to a
full year of expense related to fixed-value contingent
compensation and the achievement of final performance-based
criteria. R&D spending in dollars declined by 9% in fiscal
2002 as compared to fiscal 2001. The decline in R&D expenses
in dollars was primarily due to the elimination of bonuses and
the temporary reduction of salaries of our most highly
compensated employees partially offset by selective hiring of
engineers. As a result of the decline in year-over-year revenue,
R&D spending as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2002
increased to 24.8% in fiscal 2002 from 20.4% in fiscal 2001.
Despite the significant decline in sales in fiscal 2002, in view
of our long-term business strategy, we continued to invest in
R&D at levels commensurate with significantly higher revenue
levels than we were achieving in the short term. At any point in
time we have hundreds of R&D projects underway, and we
believe that none of these projects is material on an individual
basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative
technologies and processes for new products and we believe that
a continued commitment to R&D is essential in order to
maintain product leadership with our existing products and to
provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we
expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in
the future. In fiscal 2001, R&D expense increased to
$465 million from $390 million in fiscal 2000 as a
result of additional expenses associated with increased
engineering headcount.

Selling,
Marketing, General and Administrative

Selling, marketing, general and administrative,
or SMG&A, expenses were $257 million in fiscal 2002, a
decrease of $30 million, or 10.5%, from the
$287 million recorded in fiscal 2001. The decrease in
SMG&A expenses in dollars was the result of cost reduction
programs including the elimination of bonuses and temporary
salary reductions for our most highly compensated employees
along with continued tight control over discretionary expenses.
As a percentage of sales, SMG&A increased to 15% for fiscal
2002 from 12.6% in fiscal 2001 as a result of reduced revenue
levels in fiscal 2002. The industry downturn offered us the
opportunity to hire experienced, technically-savvy personnel,
many of whom were already familiar with our products and, as a
result, we significantly increased our field application
engineers during fiscal 2002. Despite the decline in net sales,
we decided to significantly increase our field applications
engineers in order to help our customers design in our newest
products. In fiscal 2001, SMG&A expenses decreased by
$6 million to $287 million from $293 million in
fiscal 2000. As a percentage of sales, SMG&A increased to
12.6% in fiscal 2001 from 11.4% in fiscal 2000 as a result of
reduced revenue levels.



Amortization
of Intangibles

Amortization of intangibles was $57 million
for fiscal 2002 compared with $53 million for fiscal 2001
and $11 million in fiscal 2000. In fiscal 2003, we
anticipate amortization expense to decrease to approximately
$3 million as a result of our adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets.” The increase in amortization
expense in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 was primarily
due to amortization of goodwill associated with acquisitions
completed in fiscal 2001 where amortization commenced during
fiscal 2001. The increase in amortization expense in fiscal 2001
as compared to fiscal 2000 was attributable to the amortization
of goodwill associated with the acquisition of BCO Technologies
plc. in the third quarter of fiscal 2000, and the acquisitions
of Thomas Neuroth AG, Signal Processing Associates Pty. Ltd.,
Integrated Micro Instruments, Inc., ChipLogic, Inc. and Staccato
Systems, Inc. completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2001.

Special
Charges

During fiscal 2002, we recorded special charges
totaling $48.5 million and, during fiscal 2001, we recorded
special charges of $47 million.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we recorded
special charges of approximately $27.2 million. The second
quarter charge included $25.7 million related to the
planned transfer of production from our three older four-inch
wafer fabrication facilities to our three six-inch and one
eight-inch wafer fabrication facilities, and $3 million
primarily related to the impairment of an investment, which was
offset by a $1.5 million adjustment to estimated equipment
cancellation fees recorded in fiscal year 2001. The investment
impairment, which was related to an equity investment in a
private company, was due to our decision to abandon the product
strategy for which the investment was made. Included in the
$25.7 million component of the special charge are severance
and fringe benefit costs of $15.3 million for 509
manufacturing employees in the United States and Ireland, of
which 182 of these employees had been terminated as of
November 2, 2002, $2.3 million related to the
write-down of equipment to be abandoned and $8.1 million of
other charges primarily related to lease termination and cleanup
costs. In addition, the remaining service lives of certain
assets within the older four-inch wafer fabrication facilities
have been shortened. Depreciation expense included in cost of
sales in fiscal 2002 included additional depreciation of
approximately $8.7 million associated with the shortened
lives of these assets. The write-down of equipment was
principally due to our decision to discontinue various product
development strategies. As of November 2, 2002, there was
$25 million related to these charges remaining to be paid.
This program is proceeding in accordance with our original plan
and we expect to substantially complete these actions by
mid-fiscal 2003. Once fully complete, we anticipate annual
savings from the above actions of approximately
$60 million, primarily in cost of sales, and the first full
year’s impact will be fiscal 2004.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we
recorded special charges of $12.8 million. The charges
included severance and fringe benefit costs of $3.7 million
related to cost reduction actions taken in several product
groups and, to a lesser extent, in manufacturing,
$3.8 million related to the impairment of an investment,
$3.4 million impairment of goodwill related to the closure
of an Austrian design center we acquired in fiscal 2001 and
$1.9 million primarily related to the abandonment of
equipment and lease cancellation fees. The investment
impairment, which was related to an equity investment in a
private company, was due to our decision to abandon the product
strategy for which the investment was made. The severance and
fringe benefit costs were for approximately 70 engineering
employees in the United States, Europe and Canada, and
approximately 30 manufacturing employees in the United States.
All of the manufacturing employees and approximately 32 of the
engineering employees had been terminated as of November 2,
2002. As of November 2, 2002, there was $4.3 million
related to these charges remaining to be paid. We expect to
substantially complete these actions in the first quarter of
fiscal 2003. Once fully complete, we anticipate the workforce
reductions will result in annual savings of approximately
$10 million, primarily in operating expenses.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we
recorded special charges of $8.4 million. The charges
included severance and fringe benefit costs of $2.5 million
related to cost reduction actions taken in our sales



group, several product groups and in
manufacturing for approximately 65 employees in the United
States and Europe, of which 40 had been terminated as of
November 2, 2002. The charges also included
$2.1 million related to the impairment of investments,
$1.8 million primarily related to the abandonment of
equipment and lease cancellation fees and a change in estimate
of $2 million related to previously recorded cleanup costs.
The investment impairment charges were related to the decline in
fair value of a publicly-traded equity investment below cost
basis that was determined to be other-than-temporary and of an
equity investment in a private company. The private company
equity investment was part of a product strategy we decided to
abandon. As of November 2, 2002, there was
$3.1 million related to these charges remaining to be paid.
We expect to substantially complete these actions by the third
quarter of fiscal 2003. Once fully complete, we anticipate the
workforce reductions will result in annual savings of
approximately $4 million, primarily in operating expenses.

The restructuring actions underlying the special
charges accrued in fiscal 2002 are proceeding as planned. The
cost savings impact in fiscal 2002 of the special charges
related to severance and benefits was approximately
$2 million. Most of the remaining accrued special charge is
attributable to actions planned and accrued in the second
quarter of fiscal 2002 that involved the transfer of production
from three separate four-inch wafer fabrication facilities to
our six-inch and eight-inch wafer fabrication facilities, which
are located in Massachusetts, California and Ireland. Our plan
is for this transfer to be completed by mid-fiscal 2003.

During fiscal 2001, we recorded special charges
of $47 million related to cost reduction actions taken in
response to the then current economic climate. The actions
consisted of workforce reductions in manufacturing and, to a
lesser extent, in selling, marketing and administrative areas.
In addition, we made a decision to consolidate worldwide
manufacturing operations and rationalize production planning and
quality activities. The cost reductions included severance and
fringe benefit costs of $29.6 million for approximately
1,200 employees in the United States, Europe, Asia and the
Philippines, of which approximately 1,010 of these employees had
been terminated as of November 2, 2002. The remaining 190
employees are expected to be terminated during the first quarter
of fiscal 2003. As of November 2, 2002, $23 million of
the $29.6 million aggregate severance cost obligations
underlying the fiscal 2001 worldwide cost reduction actions had
been paid. The special charge also included $11.6 million
related to the abandonment of equipment resulting from the
consolidation of worldwide manufacturing operations and
$5.8 million of other charges primarily related to
equipment and lease cancellation fees. Based on the results of
negotiations with vendors regarding purchase order cancellation
fees, the amount paid was approximately $1.5 million less
than the amount recorded for such charges and accordingly, in
the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we adjusted the provision for
purchase order cancellation fees by $1.5 million to reflect
this change in estimate. As of November 2, 2002, there was
$7.6 million related to these charges remaining to be paid.
We believe that the workforce reductions will result in annual
salary savings of approximately $40 million, consisting of
a $27 million reduction in cost of sales and a
$13 million reduction in operating expenses. The impact in
fiscal 2002 of these cost savings was approximately
$30 million, consisting of a $20 million reduction in
cost of sales and a $10 million reduction in operating
expenses.

The restructuring actions included in the special
charges recorded during fiscal 2001 are proceeding as planned.
Of the $47 million of special charges recorded in fiscal
2001, $7.6 million remained accrued as of November 2,
2002. The amount covers termination payments being paid as
income continuance to 1,010 terminated employees as a result of
the fiscal 2001 actions as well as accrued termination payments
for the remaining 190 employees expected to be terminated in the
first quarter of fiscal 2003.

Operating
Income

Our operating income was $118 million, or
6.9% of sales, in fiscal 2002, compared to $408 million, or
17.9% of sales, in fiscal 2001 and $767 million, or 29.8%
of net sales, for fiscal 2000.

Nonoperating
Income and Expense

Interest expense was $44 million in fiscal
2002 compared to $62 million in fiscal 2001. The decrease
in interest expense was the result of an interest rate swap
agreement we entered into in January 2002 that has the effect of
swapping the 4.75% fixed rate of our $1,200 million
convertible subordinated notes into a LIBOR-



based floating rate (1.61% as of November 6,
2002). Interest expense was $62 million in fiscal 2001
compared to $6 million in fiscal 2000. The increase in
interest expense was the result of a full year of interest
expense on our $1,200 million of 4.75% convertible
subordinated notes, which were issued in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2000.

Interest income was $65 million in fiscal
2002 compared to $133 million in fiscal 2001. The decrease
in interest income was attributable to less income earned on our
invested cash balances due to the decline in interest rates
during fiscal 2002 as a result of actions taken by the Federal
Reserve Board and our decision to increase our holdings of
higher credit quality yet lower interest-bearing investments.
Interest income was $133 million in fiscal 2001 compared to
$63 million in fiscal 2000. The increase in interest income
was due to higher cash balances from increased cash flow as well
as the unused portion of the funds obtained from the issuance of
our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes.

Other income decreased approximately
$28 million in fiscal 2002 from fiscal 2001 due to a
one-time gain on the sale of our investment in WaferTech
recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2001. Other income
decreased approximately $12 million in fiscal 2001 from
fiscal 2000 primarily due to a one-time gain of $44 million
on the sale of our investment in Chartered Semiconductor
Manufacturing Pte. Ltd. recorded in the third quarter of
fiscal 2000, offset by the sale of WaferTech described above.

Provision
for Income Taxes

Our effective income tax rate decreased to 25.0%
for fiscal 2002 as compared to 29.7% for fiscal 2001 due to a
shift in the mix of worldwide profits. Our effective income tax
rate remained relatively flat at 29.7% for fiscal 2001 as
compared to 29.9% for fiscal 2000. The effective income tax rate
for fiscal 2003 is expected to be approximately 22.0%. The
expected decrease is the result of the discontinuance of
goodwill amortization in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 as a
result of our adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

Net
Income

Fiscal 2002 net income was $105 million, or
6.2% of sales, and diluted earnings per share was $0.28 compared
to net income in fiscal 2001 of $356 million, or 15.7% of
sales, and diluted earnings per share of $0.93. The fiscal 2002
decrease in net income from fiscal 2001 was primarily due to
reduced revenue levels. Net income decreased to
$356 million in fiscal 2001 from $607 million, or
23.6% of sales, in fiscal 2000.

The impact of inflation on our business during
the past three years has not been significant.

Acquisitions

During the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we
completed the following acquisitions:

•

In the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we completed
    the acquisitions of Thomas Neuroth AG, Signal Processing
    Associates Pty. Ltd. and Integrated Micro Instruments, Inc. The
    total amount paid for these acquisitions, as of November 2,
    2002, was $10.2 million. As of November 2, 2002, the
    remaining contingent consideration of $2.7 million will be
    paid if certain operational objectives are met and will be
    accounted for as compensation expense.

•

On January 4, 2001, we acquired ChipLogic,
    Inc. of Santa Clara, California. ChipLogic is a developer of
    high-performance integrated circuits and software focused on the
    convergence of voice, broadband access and network protocol
    processing. The total purchase price of $68.3 million
    consisted of approximately $4 million in cash,
    approximately 1 million shares of our common stock valued
    at $60.2 million and the assumption of $4.1 million of
    outstanding ChipLogic vested stock options. Approximately
    $9.5 million represented the purchase price of in-process
    technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility,
    had no alternative future use and was charged to operations
    during fiscal 2001. An additional $8 million of cash
    consideration and 489,375 shares of common stock is due if
    certain operational objectives are achieved and will, if paid,
    be accounted for as compensation expense. Of these shares,
    249,375 contingent shares have a fixed value of approximately
    $13 million and are being charged to operations over a
    five-year period as



their restrictions lapse. The remaining 240,000
    shares are subject to performance-based criteria and during
    fiscal 2001, approximately $4.2 million of expense was
    recorded related to the issuance of 117,592 shares of common
    stock associated with the achievement of certain of these
    objectives. During fiscal 2002, approximately $5 million
    was recorded related to the issuance of the remaining shares. As
    of November 2, 2002, there was $8 million of remaining
    contingent consideration. We expect to pay approximately
    $2.7 million of this contingent consideration in the first
    quarter of fiscal 2003. An additional $2.8 million of
    compensation expense is being recorded annually through fiscal
    2005 related to our assumption of unvested stock options.

•

On January 16, 2001, we acquired Staccato
    Systems, Inc. of Mountain View, California. Staccato is in the
    field of audio synthesis technology. The total purchase price of
    $23.8 million consisted of $23 million in cash and the
    assumption of $0.8 million of outstanding Staccato vested
    stock options. We paid an additional $7 million related to
    the achievement of operational objectives that was accounted for
    as additional goodwill, of which approximately $5 million
    was recorded in fiscal 2002. All of the contingent consideration
    had been paid as of November 2, 2002. An additional
    $0.2 million of compensation expense is being recorded
    annually through fiscal 2005 related to the assumption of
    unvested stock options.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2000, we
acquired BCO Technologies plc, or BCO, a company with operations
in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in a cash-for-stock transaction
valued at approximately $163 million. BCO is a leading
supplier of silicon-on-insulator, or SOI, wafers used for
fabricating micromechanical devices. As a result of our
acquisition of BCO, we are incorporating SOI technology into our
next generation of inertial sensors. In connection with this
acquisition, we recorded approximately $158 million of
goodwill. There was no in-process research and development
write-off related to this acquisition.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 141, or FAS 141, “Business Combinations”
and No. 142, or FAS 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets.” FAS 141 requires that all business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting. Under FAS 142,
which is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to
have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be
subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the
statement. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized
over their estimated useful lives. As of November 2002, we have
adopted these new pronouncements. Application of the
non-amortization provisions of FAS 142 is expected to
result in an increase in annual net income of approximately
$54 million, beginning in fiscal 2003. During fiscal 2003,
we will perform the first of the required impairment tests of
goodwill as of November 3, 2002.

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 143, or FAS 143, “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations,” which addresses financial
accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with
the retirement of tangible long-lived assets that result from
the acquisition, construction, development and (or) the
normal operation of a long-lived asset, except for certain
obligations of lessees. We are required to adopt FAS 143 in
the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and do not believe that the
adoption of FAS 143 will have a material effect on our
financial position or results of operations.

In August 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 144, or FAS 144, “Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” which
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the
impairment of long-lived assets. This statement supersedes
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121,
“Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of,” and the accounting
and reporting provisions for the disposal of a segment of a
business set forth in APB Opinion No. 30, “Reporting
the Results of Operations-Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a
Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and
Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions.” We are
required to adopt FAS 144 in the first quarter of



fiscal 2003 and do not believe that the adoption
of FAS 144 will have a material effect on our financial
position or results of operations.

In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 145, or FAS 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements
No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement
No. 13, and Technical Corrections.” Under
FAS 145, gains and losses on extinguishments of debt are to
be classified as income or loss from continuing operations
rather than extraordinary items. We are required to adopt
FAS 145 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and do not
expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact
on our financial condition or results of operations.

In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 146, or FAS 146, “Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” The statement
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or
disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the
date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Costs covered
by the statement include lease termination costs and certain
employee severance costs that are associated with a
restructuring, plant closing, or other exit or disposal
activity. This statement is effective for exit or disposal
activities initiated after December 31, 2002. FAS 146
may affect the timing of our recognition of future exit or
disposal costs, if any.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

At November 2, 2002, we had
$2,898 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments compared to $2,793 million at November 3,
2001. The $105 million increase in cash, cash equivalents
and short-term investments was primarily due to operating cash
inflows of $226 million, or 13% of sales in fiscal 2002,
and $37 million of proceeds from employee stock plans,
offset by a $98 million repurchase of shares of our common
stock and $57 million of capital spending. In fiscal 2001,
our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased
by $558 million to $2,793 million from
$2,235 million in fiscal 2000 primarily due to operating
cash inflows of $844 million, or 37% of sales in fiscal
2001, offset by $297 million of capital spending. Investing
activities provided $90 million in fiscal 2002 and used
$1,220 million in fiscal 2001, while financing activities
used $69 million in fiscal 2002 and provided
$2 million in fiscal 2001.

Accounts receivable of $228 million at the
end of fiscal 2002 increased $10 million, or 4.7%, from
$218 million at the end of fiscal 2001. This increase
resulted principally from a $32 million increase in sales
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 as compared to the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Days sales outstanding remained
at 46 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002
as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. As a
percentage of annualized fourth quarter sales, accounts
receivable was 12.5% at the end of fiscal 2002, down from 12.9%
at the end of fiscal 2001.

Inventories increased $60 million, or 24%,
from the end of fiscal 2001 to $306 million at the end of
fiscal 2002. Days cost of sales in inventory increased by
24 days to 135 days as of the end of the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2002. The increase in inventory in dollars was
attributable to the combination of internal die bank builds and
external wafer purchases. The build in die bank inventory was in
preparation for the transfer of production from our four-inch
wafer fabrication facilities to our six- and eight-inch wafer
fabrication facilities. The external wafer purchases were in
support of expected demand in our handset and consumer analog
business. We are nearing the completion of the die bank build
and have cut back on external wafer purchases. Therefore, we
expect that inventory will remain relatively flat in dollars
during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and our days cost of
sales in inventory will start to decline towards our long-term
model of 100 to 110 days during fiscal 2003.

Net additions to property, plant and equipment of
$57 million in fiscal 2002 were funded with a combination
of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. Capital
spending in fiscal 2002 was down substantially from the
$297 million incurred in fiscal 2001. In response to the
slowdown in our served markets, we have substantially reduced
our capital spending. We currently plan to make capital
expenditures of approximately $80 million in fiscal 2003.
Capital expenditures are expected to remain low, as we believe
we currently have ample installed capacity to significantly
increase internal production levels. Depreciation expense is
expected to decrease slightly in fiscal 2003 from
$181 million in fiscal 2002.



We acquired five companies during fiscal 2001, as
more fully described in “Acquisitions.” Total cash
used to purchase these companies was approximately
$38.5 million in 2001 and another $5.2 million was
paid in fiscal 2002 as certain operational objectives were
achieved, and these additional payments were accounted for as
additional goodwill.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, we
issued $1,200 million of 4.75% convertible subordinated
notes due 2005, or 2005 notes, with semiannual interest payments
on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 2005 notes are
convertible, at the option of the holder, into shares of our
common stock at any time unless previously redeemed or
repurchased, at a conversion price of $129.78 per share, subject
to adjustment in certain events. The net proceeds of the
offering were $1,172 million after payment of the
underwriting discount and expenses of the offering, which are
being amortized over the term of the 2005 notes.

The table below summarizes our contractual cash
obligations as of November 2, 2002:

At November 2, 2002, our principal source of
liquidity was $2,898 million of cash and cash equivalents
and short-term investments. We believe that our existing sources
of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future
operations, together with current and anticipated available
long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations,
capital expenditures and research and development efforts for at
least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable
future.

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of the
financial condition and results of operations is based upon the
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. The preparation of these financial statements
requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We
base our estimates and judgments on historical experience,
knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur
in the future given available information. We consider the
following accounting policies to be both those most important to
the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require
the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ
significantly from management’s estimates and projections,
there could be a material effect on our financial statements.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost
(first-in, first-out method) or market. Because of the cyclical
nature of the semiconductor industry, inventory levels,
obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write
down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of
consistent methodologies to determine the amount of inventory
reserves necessary. While a portion of the reserve is determined
via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or
market calculations, an element of the reserve is subject to
significant judgments by us about future demand for our
inventory. Additionally, we have built inventory in preparation
for the transfer of production from our four-inch wafer
fabrication facilities to our six- and eight-inch wafer
fabrication facilities for both lifetime supply and transition
inventory. We have recorded certain levels of reserves related
to these inventory builds. Although we believe that we have used
our best efforts and information to estimate future demand, due
to the uncertain economic times and the difficulty inherent in
predicting future results, it is possible that actual demand for
our products will differ from our estimates. If actual demand
for products is less than our estimates, additional reserves for
existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods.



Long-Lived
Assets

We review property, plant, and equipment for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of such an asset may not be
recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by
comparison of their carrying amount to future undiscounted cash
flows the assets are expected to generate. If such assets are
considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in
earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the
assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a
quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing
a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no
material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant,
and equipment during the past three fiscal years, except those
made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in
our business in the future could lead to such impairment
adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of
long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results
that are used in the preparation of the expected future
undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the
remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ
from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these
assets. These differences could result in impairment charges,
which could have a material adverse impact on our results of
operations.

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 142, or FAS 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets.” In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we
will adopt the new rules of FAS 142 for measuring the
impairment of goodwill, which prescribe a fair value-based
approach. The estimates and assumptions described above along
with other factors such as discount rates will affect the amount
of an impairment loss, if any, we recognize under FAS 142.
Upon adoption of FAS 142, we will be required to make a
transition test of our goodwill for impairment, which may result
in a significant transition impairment loss. Any transition
impairment loss will be recorded as a change in accounting
principle. At least annually thereafter, we will be required to
test goodwill for impairment, which may result in additional
impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on
our results of operations.

Accounting
for Income Taxes

We account for income taxes in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, or
FAS 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” which
requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized
using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences
between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and
liabilities. FAS 109 also requires that deferred tax assets
be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than
not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not
be realized. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax
assets quarterly by assessing our valuation allowance and by
adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. At
November 2, 2002, we had deferred tax assets of
$159 million primarily resulting from temporary differences
between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. While
these assets are not assured of realization, we have conducted
an assessment of the likelihood of realization and concluded
that no significant valuation allowance is required. In reaching
our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including
the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to
absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior
carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses
and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding
future profitability may change due to future market conditions,
changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors.
These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these
deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or
an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations
are made.

In addition, we have provided for potential
liabilities due in various foreign jurisdictions. Judgment is
required in determining our worldwide income tax expense
provision. In the ordinary course of global business, there are
many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax
outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a
consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related
entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no
assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these
matters will not be different than that which is reflected in
our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such
differences could have a material impact on our income tax
provision and operating results in the period in which such
determination is made.



Contingencies

From time to time, we receive notices that our
products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent
or intellectual property rights of others. We periodically
assess each matter in order to determine if a contingent
liability in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 5, or FAS 5, “Accounting for
Contingencies,” should be recorded. In making this
determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter,
consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical
experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our
judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each
matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent
loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be
estimated. Should a loss be probable and estimable, we record a
contingent loss in accordance with FAS 5. In determining
the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received
from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal
proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior
case history and other factors. Should the judgments and
estimates made by us be incorrect, we may need to record
additional contingent losses that could materially adversely
impact our results of operations. See Note 11 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Stock Options

We have voluntarily provided the following
disclosure in order to provide our stockholders with a single
source for information about our stock options. We believe that
this disclosure, combined with the disclosure provided in
Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained
in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in
our 2003 proxy statement, provides detailed information about
our stock option programs.

Option
Program Description

Our stock option program is a broad-based,
long-term employee retention program that is intended to
attract, retain and motivate our employees, officers and
directors and to align their interests with those of our
stockholders. We have two plans under which we currently grant
stock options:

1) The 1998 Stock Option
    Plan,

as amended, under which
    officers, directors and employees of Analog are granted options
    to purchase shares of our common stock; and

2) The 2001 Broad-Based Stock Option
    Plan,

as amended, under which options
    to purchase shares of our common stock may be granted to all
    employees, consultants and advisors of Analog, other than
    officers or directors.

Substantially all of our employees participate in
these plans. Option vesting periods are generally
five years for our grants and all options have a term of
ten years. Our option plans do not permit us to grant options at
exercise prices that are below the fair market value of our
common stock as of the date of grant. These plans are critical
to our efforts to create and maintain a competitive advantage in
the extremely competitive semiconductor industry.

Options are generally granted once per year
between September and January as part of our annual performance
appraisal process. Occasionally, as in fiscal year 2002, two
sets of option grants can fall within one fiscal year, as the
process spans the end of one fiscal year and the beginning of
the next fiscal year. Conversely, as in fiscal year 1999, there
are fiscal years in which no annual merit options are granted.
We have a goal to keep the dilution related to our option
program to a long-term average of approximately 4% annually. The
dilution percentage is calculated as the total number of shares
of our common stock underlying new option grants for the year,
net of options forfeited by employees leaving the company,
divided by total outstanding shares of our common stock.

All stock option grants to executive officers and
directors can be made only from stockholder approved plans and
are made after a review by, and with the approval of the
compensation committee of our board of directors. All members of
the compensation committee are independent directors, as that
term is defined in the applicable rules for issuers traded on
the New York Stock Exchange. See the “Report of the
Compensation Committee” in our 2003 proxy statement for
further information regarding the policies and procedures of
Analog and the compensation committee regarding our grant of
stock options.



In December 2002, our Board of Directors adopted
an amendment to each of our 2001 Broad-Based Stock Option Plan
and our 1998 Stock Option Plan to provide that the terms of
outstanding options under these plans may not be amended to
provide an option exercise price per share which is lower than
the original option exercise price per share.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains or
incorporates forward-looking statements within the meaning of
section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These
forward-looking statements are based on current expectations,
estimates, forecasts and projections about the industry and
markets in which we operate and management’s beliefs and
assumptions. In addition, other written or oral statements that
constitute forward-looking statements may be made by or on our
behalf. Words such as “expect,”
“anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,”
“believe,” “seek,” “estimate,”
variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to
identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are
not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks,
uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We
have included important factors in the cautionary statements
below under the heading “Factors That May Affect Future
Results” that we believe could cause our actual results to
differ materially from the forward-looking statements we make.
We do not intend to update publicly any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise.



Factors That May Affect Future
Results

Our future operating results are difficult to
predict and may materially fluctuate.

Our future operating results are difficult to
predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors,
including the timing of new product announcements or
introductions by us or our competitors, competitive pricing
pressures, fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate
availability of wafers and manufacturing capacity, the risk that
our backlog could decline significantly, our ability to hire,
retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other
qualified employees to meet the demands of our largest
customers, changes in product mix, and the effect of adverse
changes in economic conditions in the United States and
international markets. In addition, the semiconductor market has
historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic
downturns at various times, including the decline in demand
experienced since early in fiscal year 2001. Our business is
subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no
assurance, depending on the mix of future business, that
products stocked in inventory will not be rendered obsolete
before we ship them. As a result of these and other factors,
there can be no assurance that we will not experience material
fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or
annual basis.

Long-term contracts are not typical for us and
reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products
could adversely affect our operating results.

In certain markets where end-user demand may be
particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers
place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it
available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to
make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the
product. At any given time, this situation could affect a
portion of our backlog. As a result, we are subject to the risk
of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp fall-off of sales
and backlog. Further, those orders may be for products that meet
the customer’s unique requirements so that those cancelled
orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable
products, resulting in potential inventory write-offs. As a
result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the
products subject to these uncertainties, the amount of
unsaleable product could be substantial. Reductions,
cancellations or delays in orders for our products could
adversely affect our operating results.

Our future success depends upon our ability to
develop and market new products and enter new markets.

Our success significantly depends on our
continued ability to develop and market new products. There can
be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce
new products in a timely manner or that new products, if
developed, will achieve market acceptance. In addition, our
growth is dependent on our continued ability to penetrate new
markets where we have limited experience and competition is
intense. There can be no assurance that the markets we serve
will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will
meet the requirements of these markets, that our products will
achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors
will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take
market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain profits
in these markets. Also, some of our customers in these markets
are less established, which could subject us to increased credit
risk.

We may not be able to compete successfully in
the semiconductor industry in the future.

Many other companies offer products that compete
with our products. Some also offer other electronic products,
and some have greater financial, manufacturing, technical and
marketing resources than we have. Additionally, some formerly
independent competitors have been purchased by larger companies.
Our competitors also include emerging companies selling
specialized products to markets we serve. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the
future against existing or new competitors, or that our
operating results will not be adversely affected by increased
price competition.



We may not be able to satisfy increasing
demand for our products, and increased production may lead to
overcapacity and lower prices.

The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry
has resulted in sustained or short-term periods when demand for
our products has increased or decreased rapidly. We, and the
semiconductor industry, experienced a period of rapid decreases
in demand that began early in fiscal 2001. As a result, we have
overcapacity due to the expansion of our production facilities
and increased access to third-party foundries. However, we
cannot be sure that we will not encounter unanticipated
production problems at either our own facilities or at
third-party foundries, or that our capacity will be sufficient
to satisfy demand for our products. We believe that other
semiconductor manufacturers have expanded their production
capacity over the past several years. This expansion by us and
our competitors, and the continuation of the decline in the
demand for semiconductor products that began early in fiscal
2001, has led to overcapacity in our target markets, which has
resulted in a year-over-year decline in our revenue and could
lead to price erosion that would adversely affect our operating
results.

We rely on third-party subcontractors and
manufacturers for some industry-standard wafers and
assembly/test services, and therefore cannot control their
availability or conditions of supply.

We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on
assembly and test subcontractors and on third-party wafer
fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be
manufactured using industry-standard digital processes. This
reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over
delivery schedules, manufacturing yields and costs.
Additionally, we utilize third party wafer fabricators as
sole-source suppliers, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company. These suppliers manufacture components in
accordance with our proprietary designs and specifications. We
have no written supply agreements with these sole-source
suppliers and purchase our custom components through individual
purchase orders. If these sole-source suppliers are unable or
unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of
components to us, on the time schedule and of the quality that
we require, we may be forced to seek to engage additional or
replacement suppliers, which could result in additional expenses
and delays in product development or shipment of product to our
customers.

Our revenues may not increase enough to offset
the expense of additional capacity.

Our capacity additions in fiscal 2001 resulted in
a significant increase in operating expenses. If revenue levels
do not increase enough to offset these additional expense
levels, our future operating results could be adversely
affected. In addition, asset values could be impaired if the
additional capacity is underutilized for an extended period of
time. Should we be unsuccessful in completing this expansion on
time, or should customer demand fail to increase and we no
longer need the additional capacity, our financial position and
results of operations could be adversely impacted.

Our transition of products to more modern
facilities and related inventory builds may not progress as
planned.

We are transitioning products from our older
four-inch wafer fabrication facilities to our six-inch and
eight-inch wafer fabrication facilities. We have built inventory
in preparation for this transfer for both lifetime supply and
transition inventory. We have recorded certain levels of
reserves related to these inventory builds. Although we believe
that we have used our best efforts and information to estimate
future demand, due to the uncertain economic times and the
difficulty inherent in predicting future results, it is possible
that actual demand for our products will differ from our
estimates. If we are unable to transition our products as
planned or if actual demand for products included in our
inventory builds is less than our estimates, our financial
position and results of operations could be adversely impacted.

Our manufacturing processes are highly
technical and may be interrupted.

We have both generic and proprietary
manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of
technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly
complex and precise process. Minute impurities,



contaminants in the manufacturing environment,
difficulties in the fabrication process, defects in the masks
used in the wafer manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment
failures, wafer breakage or other factors can cause a
substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice
on each wafer to be nonfunctional. While we have significant
expertise in semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that
some processes could become unstable. This instability could
result in manufacturing delays and product shortages.

We rely on manufacturing capacity located in
geologically unstable areas, which could affect the availability
of supplies and services.

We, and many companies in the semiconductor
industry, rely on internal manufacturing capacity located in
California and Taiwan as well as wafer fabrication foundries in
Taiwan and other sub-contractors in geologically unstable
locations around the world. This reliance involves risks
associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the
semiconductor industry, including temporary loss of capacity,
availability and cost of key raw materials and equipment and
availability of key services including transport. In addition,
California has experienced intermittent interruption in the
availability of electricity. To date, the impact on us has been
negligible. However, electricity is a critical resource for us,
without which our products could not be manufactured at
factories exposed to continued lengthy power interruptions. Any
prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing
facilities as a result of fire, natural disaster, unavailability
of electric power or otherwise, would have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

We are exposed to economic, political and
other risks through our significant worldwide
operations.

During fiscal 2002, approximately 70% of our
revenues were derived from customers in international markets.
We have manufacturing facilities outside the United States in
Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Philippines and Taiwan. In
addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the
semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic and
political risks inherent in international operations and their
impact on the United States economy in general, including the
risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and
economic instability in many countries around the world as well
as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism, particularly
in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11,
2001 and the response to them by the United States and its
allies. These risks include air transportation disruptions,
expropriation, currency controls and changes in currency
exchange rates, tax and tariff rates, freight rates and social
and political unrest. Although we engage in hedging transactions
to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations,
there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not
be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the
United States dollar against other currencies.

We are involved in frequent litigation
regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly to
defend and could require us to redesign products or pay
significant royalties.

There can be no assurance that any patent will
issue on pending applications or that any patent issued will
provide substantive protection for the technology or product
covered by it. We believe that patent and mask set protection is
of less significance in our business than experience,
innovation, and management skill. There also can be no assurance
that others will not develop or patent similar technology, or
reverse engineer our products, or that our confidentiality
agreements with employees, consultants, silicon foundries and
other suppliers and vendors will be adequate to protect our
interests.

The semiconductor industry is characterized by
frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other
intellectual property rights, including claims arising under our
contractual indemnification of our customers. We have received
from time to time, and may receive in the future, claims from
third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe
their patents or other intellectual property rights. In the
event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim
against us and a license is not available to us on commercially
reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to
redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that
intellectual property, and our operating results could be
materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary
to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property
rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this
litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key
personnel. See Note 11 in the Notes to our Consolidated
Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual
Report



on Form 10-K for information concerning
pending litigation that involves us. An adverse outcome in this
or other litigation could have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results
of operations or cash flows in the period in which the
litigation is resolved.

We may be unable to adequately protect our
proprietary rights, which may limit our ability to compete
effectively.

We rely primarily upon know-how, rather than on
patents, to develop and maintain our competitive position. There
can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent
similar technology or reverse engineer our products or that the
confidentiality agreements upon which we rely will be adequate
to protect our interests. Other companies have obtained patents
covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and
we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these
patents or be precluded from making and selling the infringing
products, if such patents are found to be valid. There can be no
assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses, if required,
upon commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Moreover, the
laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture and
market our products may afford little or no effective protection
of our proprietary technology.

Leverage and debt service obligations may
adversely affect our cash flow.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, we
issued $1,200,000,000 of 4.75% convertible subordinated notes
due 2005 and, as a result, we have a substantial amount of
outstanding indebtedness. We may be unable to generate cash
sufficient to pay the principal of, interest on, and other
amounts due in respect of, this indebtedness when due. Our
substantial leverage could have significant negative
consequences. This substantial leverage could increase our
vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry
conditions. It may require the dedication of a substantial
portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service the
indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of our expected cash
flow available for other purposes, including capital
expenditures. It may also limit our flexibility in planning for,
or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in
which we operate.

If we do not retain our key personnel, our
ability to execute our business strategy will be
limited.

Our success depends to a significant extent upon
the continued service of our executive officers and key
management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced
engineers, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain,
and motivate qualified personnel. The competition for these
employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or more of
our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our
operating results. In addition, there could be a material
adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and
other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable
to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do not maintain
any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or
employees.

Our future operating results are dependent on
the performance of independent distributors and sales
representatives.

A significant portion of our sales are through
independent distributors that are not under our control. These
independent distributors generally represent product lines
offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales
efforts applied to our products or terminate their
representation of us. We generally do not require letters of
credit from our distributors and are not protected against
accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors.
Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could
adversely affect our results of operations. Termination of a
significant distributor, whether at our initiative or the
distributor’s initiative, could disrupt our current
business. If we are unable to find suitable replacements in the
event of terminations by significant distributors or sales
representatives, our operating results could be adversely
affected.



ITEM 7A.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
    MARKET RISK

Interest
Rate Exposure

In January 2002, we entered into an interest rate
swap agreement to hedge the benchmark interest rate of our
$1,200 million convertible subordinated notes. The effect
of the swap was to convert our 4.75% fixed rate to a variable
rate, currently based on the 3-month London Interbank Offered
Rate, or LIBOR. If LIBOR increases or decreases by 100 basis
points, our annual interest expense would change by
$12 million for fiscal 2002. Changes in interest rates
would affect the fair value of the interest rate swap and the
fair value of the debt obligation. For each basis point change
in the swap curve, the fair value in fiscal 2002 would change by
approximately $0.3 million. The fair value of the swap, and
therefore the related debt obligation, would also be affected by
the price and volatility of our common stock. Our annual
interest income would change by approximately $28 million
for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates.
Therefore, the effect to our interest income, net of interest
expense, would be approximately $16 million in fiscal year
2002 and $24 million in fiscal 2001. The fair values of our
investment portfolio at November 2, 2002 and
November 3, 2001 would not be significantly impacted by
either an increase or decrease in interest rates primarily due
to the short-term nature of the major portion of our investment
portfolio.

Foreign
Currency Exposure

As more fully described in Note 2 (i)
in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained
in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we
regularly hedge our non-U.S. dollar-based exposures by entering
into forward exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts
are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure
and generally range from three months to one year. The
short-term nature of these contracts has resulted in these
instruments having insignificant fair values at November 2,
2002 and November 3, 2001. Currently, our largest foreign
currency exposure is against the Euro, primarily because Europe
has a higher proportion of our local currency denominated
expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at
November 2, 2002 and November 3, 2001, a 10%
unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would
not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows or
significantly diminish the fair value of our foreign currency
financial instruments, primarily due to the short lives of the
affected financial instruments that effectively hedge
substantially all of our year-end exposures against fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates. The calculation assumes that
each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative
to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes
in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of
sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’
products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity
analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange
rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or
local currency selling prices.

Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

a.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and all of its wholly owned
subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all significant intercompany
accounts and transactions are eliminated. The Company’s
fiscal year ends on the 52-week or 53-week period ending on the
Saturday closest to the last day in October. Fiscal year 2002
was a 52-week year, fiscal year 2001 was a 53-week year, and
fiscal year 2000 was a 52-week year.

Certain amounts reported in previous years have
been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2002 presentation,
such reclassifications were immaterial.

b.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and
    Investments

Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid
investments with insignificant interest rate risk and maturities
of three months or less at the time of acquisition. The
Company’s investments, which generally have maturities
between three and twelve months at time of acquisition, are
considered short-term. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments consist primarily of corporate obligations such as
commercial paper, corporate bonds and auction rate securities,
but also include government agency notes, certificates of
deposit, bank time deposits, institutional money market funds
and bankers’ acceptances. Long-term investments consist of
mutual funds, commercial paper and institutional money market
funds that are acquired to generate returns that offset changes
in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation
arrangements, as well as equity securities.

The Company classifies its investments in readily
marketable debt and equity securities as
“held-to-maturity,” “available-for-sale” or
“trading” at the time of purchase and such designation
is evaluated as of each balance sheet date. Held-to-maturity
securities, which are carried at amortized cost, include only
those securities the Company has the positive intent and ability
to hold to maturity. Securities, such as bank time deposits,
which by their nature are typically held to maturity, are
classified as such. The Company’s other readily marketable
investments are classified as either available-for-sale or
trading. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value
with unrealized gains and losses, net of related tax, if any,
reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity.
Realized gains and losses, as well as interest, dividends and
capital gains distributions on all securities, are included in
earnings.



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The components of the Company’s
available-for-sale securities as of November 2, 2002 and
November 3, 2001 were as follows:

Cash equivalents and short-term investments
classified as held-to-maturity were $130 million and
$108 million at November 2, 2002 and November 3,
2001, respectively and were comprised solely of Euro time
deposits. Substantially all of the Company’s short-term
investments have contractual maturities of twelve months or less
at time of acquisition. Because of the short term to maturity,
and hence relative price insensitivity to changes in market
interest rates, amortized cost approximates fair value for all
of these securities. No realized gains or losses were recorded
during fiscal 2002, 2001 or 2000. Unrealized losses of
$3.9 million, net of tax of $2.1 million, were
recorded in fiscal 2002 and unrealized gains and losses were not
material during fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000. There were no cash
equivalents or short-term investments classified as trading at
November 2, 2002 and November 3, 2001.

Long-term investments classified as trading were
$278 million and $243 million at November 2, 2002
and November 3, 2001, respectively, and were based on
published market quotes on November 1, 2002 and
November 2, 2001, respectively. Gross realized and
unrealized gains and losses from trading securities were not
material in fiscal 2002, fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000. There were
approximately $0.9 million and $1.7 million at
November 2, 2002 and November 3, 2001, respectively,
of long-term investments classified as available-for-sale. Gross
realized and unrealized gains and losses were not material in
fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000. There were no long-term investments
classified as held-to-maturity at November 2, 2002 and
November 3, 2001.

c.

Supplemental Cash Flow Statement
    Information

The Company’s primary non-cash financing
activities in fiscal 2002 and 2001 resulted from its fiscal 2001
acquisitions for which 1,462,066 shares of common stock were
issued (valued at approximately $81.8 million) and stock
options with a fair value of approximately $4.9 million
were assumed. As a result, the Company recognized approximately
$10.3 million and $8.8 million of stock-based
compensation expense in fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost
(first-in, first-out method) or market. Inventories at
November 2, 2002 and November 3, 2001 were as follows:

e.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost
less allowances for depreciation and amortization. The
straight-line method of depreciation is used for all classes of
assets for financial statement purposes; both straight-line and
accelerated methods are used for income tax purposes.
Capitalized leases and leasehold improvements are amortized
based upon the lesser of the term of the lease or the useful
life of the asset. Depreciation and amortization are based on
the following useful lives:

Buildings & Building Equipment

Up to 25 years

Machinery & Equipment

3-10 years

Office Equipment

3-8 years

Total depreciation and amortization of property,
plant and equipment was $181 million, $158 million and
$143 million in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Property, plant and equipment included $77 million of
capitalized leases in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001, net of
$68 million and $56 million, respectively, of
accumulated depreciation. During fiscal 2002 and 2001, the
Company recorded $1.7 million and $6.5 million of
capitalized interest, respectively.

f.

Goodwill and Other Acquisition-related
    Intangibles

Other intangibles include items such as acquired
trained workforce and customer base. Goodwill and intangibles
are evaluated for impairment periodically or whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may
not be recoverable. When impairment indicators arise, goodwill
is reviewed for impairment by comparing the carrying amount to
the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the lowest level
of related assets. If this review indicates that goodwill is not
recoverable, the carrying amount would be reduced to fair value
based on a discounted cash flow analysis taking into
consideration the time value of money and investment risk
factors. Amortization lives are principally five years.

The balances shown are net of total accumulated
amortization of $145 million and $88 million as of
November 2, 2002 and November 3, 2001, respectively.
Amortization of goodwill and other acquisition-related
intangibles was $57 million, $53 million and
$13 million for fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

g.

Grant Accounting

The Company’s manufacturing facility in
Limerick, Ireland has received various grants from the
Industrial Development Authority of the Republic of Ireland.
These grants include capital, employment and



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

research and development grants. Capital grants
for the acquisition of property and equipment are netted against
the related capital expenditures and amortized as a credit to
depreciation expense over the useful life of the related asset.
Employment grants, which relate to employee hiring and training,
and research and development grants are recognized in earnings
in the period in which the related expenditures are incurred by
the Company.

h.

Translation of Foreign
    Currencies

The functional currency for the Company’s
foreign sales operations is the applicable local currency. Gains
and losses resulting from translation of these foreign
currencies into U.S. dollars are accumulated in other
comprehensive income. Transaction gains and losses are included
in income currently, including those at the Company’s
principal foreign manufacturing operations where the functional
currency is the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains
or losses included in other expenses, net, were not material in
fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000.

i.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Agreements

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange
contracts to offset certain operational and balance sheet
exposures from the impact of changes in foreign currency
exchange rates. Such exposures result from the portion of the
Company’s operations, assets and liabilities that are
denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily
the Japanese Yen and the Euro. These foreign exchange contracts
are entered into to support product sales, purchases and
financing transactions made in the normal course of business,
and accordingly, are not speculative in nature.

Effective October 29, 2000, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133
(FAS 133), “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities,” as amended by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 138 (FAS 138), “Accounting
for Certain Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities.” As
a result of the adoption of FAS 133, the Company records all
derivative financial instruments in the consolidated financial
statements at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for
holding the instrument. Changes in the fair value of the
derivative financial instruments are either recognized
periodically in earnings or in stockholders’ equity as a
component of other comprehensive income (OCI) depending on
whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge
accounting as defined by FAS 133. Changes in fair values of
derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting are reported in
earnings as they occur. While the adoption of FAS 133 on
October 29, 2000 did not have a material impact on
operations, it resulted in a $5 million loss recognized in
OCI, which was reclassified into earnings during fiscal 2001.

Foreign Exchange Exposure
Management

— The Company has
significant international sales and purchase transactions in
foreign currencies and has a policy of hedging forecasted and
actual foreign currency risk with forward foreign exchange
contracts. The Company’s forward foreign exchange contracts
are denominated in Japanese Yen, British Pounds Sterling and the
Euro and are for periods consistent with the terms of the
underlying transactions, generally one year or less. Derivative
instruments are employed to eliminate or minimize certain
foreign currency exposures that can be confidently identified
and quantified. In accordance with FAS 133, hedges related
to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the
inception of the respective hedges as cash flow hedges and are
evaluated for effectiveness monthly. As the terms of the
contract and the underlying transaction are matched at
inception, forward contract effectiveness is calculated by
comparing the change in fair value of the contract to the change
in the forward value of the anticipated transaction, with the
effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative
instrument reported as a component of OCI in stockholders’
equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period during
which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any residual
change in fair value of the instruments, or ineffectiveness, is
recognized immediately in other expense. No ineffectiveness was
recognized in fiscal 2002 or 2001.



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Additionally, the Company enters into foreign
currency forward contracts that economically hedge the gains and
losses generated by the remeasurement of certain recorded assets
and liabilities in a non-functional currency. Changes in the
fair value of these undesignated hedges are recognized in other
expense immediately as an offset to the changes in the fair
value of the asset or liability being hedged.

Interest Rate Exposure
Management

— In January
2002, the Company entered into an interest rate swap with an
aggregate notional amount of $1,200 million. The swap is a
derivative instrument as defined by FAS 133 and was
designated as a fair value hedge at inception. The swap hedges
the benchmark interest rate of the Company’s
$1,200 million Convertible Subordinated Notes and has the
effect of swapping the 4.75% fixed rate of the Convertible
Subordinated Notes into a LIBOR-based floating rate (1.61% as of
November 6, 2002). The interest rate swap, as well as the
Convertible Subordinated Notes, matures on October 1, 2005.
As the critical terms of the interest rate swap and the
underlying interest component of the Company’s notes were
matched at inception, effectiveness is calculated by comparing
the change in the fair value of the contract to the change in
the fair value of the interest rate component, with the
effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative
instrument reported in other expense. The interest rate swap is
designed to provide for the termination of the swap in the event
the notes are either converted or redeemed early. The Company
evaluates this fair value hedge for effectiveness quarterly, and
restructured certain terms in October 2002 to provide for an
even more highly effective hedge relationship with the
Convertible Subordinated Notes. The restructuring resulted in an
interest rate swap with terms more favorable to the Company,
offset by a promise to pay a fixed amount over time to the
counterparty regardless of when the swap is terminated. The
restructuring, which had no impact on earnings, increased the
interest rate swap asset by $27 million, with an offsetting debt
liability of an equal amount. The restructuring is expected to
increase the effectiveness of the hedge on a prospective basis.
The fair value hedge was determined to be highly effective
during each quarter, and a minor amount of ineffectiveness,
arising prior to the restructuring of the hedge, was recorded in
other expense during fiscal year 2002.

Derivative financial instruments involve, to a
varying degree, elements of market and credit risk not
recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The market
risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency
exchange rate or interest rate movements is expected to offset
the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and
liabilities being hedged. The counterparties to the agreements
relating to the Company’s foreign exchange and interest
rate instruments consist of a number of major international
financial institutions with high credit ratings. The Company
does not believe that there is significant risk of
nonperformance by these counterparties because the Company
continually monitors the credit ratings of such counterparties,
and limits the financial exposure with any one financial
institution. While the contract or notional amounts of
derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the
volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount
of the Company’s exposure to credit risk. The amounts
potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible
inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their
contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by
which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts
exceed the obligations of the Company to the counterparties.

Fair Values of Financial
    Instruments

The following estimated fair value amounts have
been determined by the Company using available market
information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However,
considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to
develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates
presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts
that the Company could realize in a current market exchange.

The following methods and assumptions were used
by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for
financial instruments:

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments

— The
carrying amounts of these items are a reasonable estimate of
their fair value due to the short term to maturity and readily
available market for these types of investments.

Long-term
investments

— The fair
value of long-term investments is based on quoted market values,
with the exception of equity investments that are carried at
cost.

Short-term
borrowings

— The
carrying amounts of these variable-rate borrowings approximate
fair value due to the short period of time to maturity.

Long-term
debt

— The fair value of
long-term debt is based on quoted market values. The carrying
amount is based on a FAS 133 valuation (see Note 2i.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Agreements

).

value of interest rate swap and cap agreements is obtained from
dealer quotes. These values represent the estimated amount the
Company would receive or pay to terminate the agreements taking
into consideration current interest rates.

Forward foreign currency exchange
contracts

— The
estimated fair value of forward foreign currency exchange
contracts is based on the estimated amount at which they could
be settled based on forward market exchange rates.

k.     Use
of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates relate to
the useful lives of fixed assets, allowances for doubtful
accounts and customer returns, inventory reserves, potential
reserves relating to litigation matters, accrued liabilities,
accrued taxes and other reserves. Actual results could differ
from those estimates, and such differences may be material to
the financial statements.

l.     Concentrations
of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally
of investments and trade accounts receivable.

The Company maintains cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments with high credit quality financial
institutions and monitors the amount of credit exposure to any
one financial institution.

The Company sells its products to distributors
and original equipment manufacturers involved in a variety of
industries including industrial automation, instrumentation,
military/ aerospace, communications, computers and peripherals,
and high-performance consumer electronics. The Company has
adopted credit policies and standards to accommodate growth in
these markets. The Company performs continuing credit
evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and
although the Company generally does not require collateral,
letters of credit may be required from its customers in certain
circumstances. Reserves are provided for estimated amounts of
accounts receivable that may not be collected.

m.     Concentration
of Other Risks

The semiconductor industry is characterized by
rapid technological change, competitive pricing pressures and
cyclical market patterns. The Company’s financial results
are affected by a wide variety of factors, including general
economic conditions worldwide, economic conditions specific to
the semiconductor industry, the timely implementation of new
manufacturing technologies, the ability to safeguard patents and
intellectual property in a rapidly evolving market and reliance
on assembly and test subcontractors, third-party wafer
fabricators and independent distributors. In addition, the
semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject
to significant economic downturns at various times. The Company
is exposed to the risk of obsolescence of its inventory
depending on the mix of future business. As a result, the
Company may experience significant period-to-period fluctuations
in future operating results due to the factors mentioned above
or other factors.

n.     Revenue
Recognition

Prior to fiscal 2001, the Company recognized
revenue from product sales to end users upon shipment. In fiscal
2001, the Company adopted the provisions of Securities and
Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin 101. Accordingly,
revenue from product sales to end-users is now recognized when
title passes, which for shipments to certain foreign countries
is subsequent to product shipment. Title for these shipments

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

ordinarily passes within a week of shipment. This
accounting change did not materially impact the Company’s
results of operations for fiscal 2001. For all periods
presented, revenue is deferred on sales made through
distributors until the distributors resell the products to the
end users.

o.     Other
Comprehensive Income

Components of other comprehensive income include
net income and certain transactions that have generally been
reported in the consolidated statement of stockholders’
equity. Other comprehensive income is comprised of net income,
currency translation adjustments, minimum pension liability
adjustments, unrealized gains (losses) on
available-for-sale securities, and net gain or loss on
derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges.

The components of accumulated other comprehensive
income at November 2, 2002 and November 3, 2001
consisted of the following:

p.     Advertising
Expense

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
Advertising expense was $10.4 million in fiscal 2002 and fiscal
2001 and $16.1 million in fiscal 2000.

q.     Income
Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on the differences between financial reporting
and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using
the enacted income tax rates and laws that are expected to be in
effect when the temporary differences are expected to reverse.
Additionally, deferred tax assets and liabilities are separated
into current and noncurrent amounts based on the classification
of the related assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes.

r.     Earnings
Per Share of Common Stock

Basic earnings per share is computed based only
on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period, plus the dilutive effect of potential future
issuances of common stock relating to stock option programs and
other potentially dilutive securities. In calculating diluted
earnings per share, the dilutive effect of stock options is
computed using the average market price for the respective
period. Potential shares related to convertible debt and certain
of the Company’s outstanding stock options



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

were excluded because they were anti-dilutive,
however these shares could be dilutive in the future. The
following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted
earnings per share:

s.     Stock-Based
Compensation

The Company grants stock options for a fixed
number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to
the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant. The
Company accounts for stock option grants in accordance with APB
Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees” and related interpretations and, accordingly,
recognizes no compensation expense for stock option grants. The
Company has granted restricted stock for a fixed number of
shares to employees for nominal consideration. Compensation
expense related to restricted stock awards is recorded ratably
over the restriction period.

t.     New
Accounting Standards

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 141 (FAS 141), “Business Combinations,”
and No. 142 (FAS 142), “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets.” FAS 141 requires that all business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting. Under FAS 142,
which is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to
have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be
subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the
Statement. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized
over their estimated useful lives. The Company must adopt these
new pronouncements no later than November 2002. Application of
the non-amortization provisions of FAS 142 is expected to
result in an increase in annual net income of approximately
$54 million, beginning in fiscal 2003. During fiscal 2003,
the Company will perform the first of the required impairment
tests of goodwill as of November 3, 2002.

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 143, (FAS 143), “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations,” which addresses financial
accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with
the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated
asset retirement costs. The Company is required to adopt
FAS 143 in the



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

first quarter of fiscal 2003 and does not believe
that the adoption of FAS 143 will have a material effect on
its financial position or results of operations.

In August 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 144, (FAS 144), “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” which
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the
impairment of long-lived assets. This statement supersedes
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121,
“Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of,” and the accounting
and reporting provisions for the disposal of a segment of a
business of APB Opinion No. 30, “Reporting the Results
of Operations-Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of
a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently
Occurring Events and Transactions.” The Company is required
to adopt FAS 144 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and
does not believe that the adoption of FAS 144 will have a
material effect on its financial position or results of
operations.

In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 145, (FAS 145), “Rescission of FASB
Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections.” Under
FAS 145, gains and losses on extinguishments of debt are to
be classified as income or loss from continuing operations
rather than extraordinary items. The Company is required to
adopt FAS 145 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and does
not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material
impact on its financial condition or results of operations.

In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 146, (FAS 146), “Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” The statement
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or
disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the
date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Costs covered
by the standard include lease termination costs and certain
employee severance costs that are associated with a
restructuring, plant closing, or other exit or disposal
activity. This statement is effective for exit or disposal
activities initiated after December 31, 2002. FAS 146
may affect the timing of the Company’s recognition of
future exit or disposal costs, if any.

3.     Acquisitions

During the first quarter of fiscal 2001, the
Company completed the following acquisitions, which were
accounted for as purchases, and, generally, the excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired
has been allocated to goodwill and is amortized over five years:

•

In the first quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company
    completed the acquisitions of Thomas Neuroth AG (Neuroth),
    Signal Processing Associates Pty. Ltd. (SPA) and Integrated
    Micro Instruments, Inc. (IMI). The total amount paid for these
    acquisitions, as of November 2, 2002, was $10.2 million. As
    of November 2, 2002, the remaining contingent consideration
    was $2.7 million, which will be paid if certain operational
    objectives are met, and will be recorded as compensation expense.

•

On January 4, 2001, the Company acquired
    ChipLogic, Inc. (ChipLogic) of Santa Clara, California.
    ChipLogic is a developer of high-performance integrated circuits
    and software focused on the convergence of voice, broadband
    access and network protocol processing. The total purchase price
    of $68.3 million consisted of cash of approximately
    $4 million, approximately 1 million shares of our
    common stock valued at $60.2 million and the assumption of
    $4.1 million of outstanding ChipLogic vested stock options.
    Approximately $9.5 million represented the purchase price
    of in-process technology that had not yet reached technological
    feasibility, had no alternative future use and was charged to
    operations during fiscal 2001. An additional $8 million of
    cash consideration and 489,375 shares of common stock is due if
    certain operational objectives are achieved and will, if paid,
    be accounted for as compensation expense. Of these shares,
    249,375 contingent shares have a fixed value of approximately
    $13 million, which is being charged to



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

operations over a five-year period as their
    restrictions lapse. The remaining 240,000 shares are subject to
    performance-based criteria and during fiscal 2001, approximately
    $4.2 million of expense was recorded related to the
    issuance of 117,592 shares of common stock associated with the
    achievement of certain of these objectives. During fiscal 2002,
    approximately $5 million of expense was recorded related to
    the issuance of the remaining shares. As of November 2,
    2002, there was $8 million of contingent consideration
    remaining to be paid. An additional $2.8 million of
    compensation expense is being recorded annually through fiscal
    2005 related to the assumption of unvested stock options.

•

On January 16, 2001, the Company acquired
    Staccato Systems, Inc. (Staccato) of Mountain View, California.
    Staccato is in the field of audio synthesis technology. The
    total purchase price of $23.8 million consisted of
    $23 million in cash and the assumption of $0.8 million
    of outstanding Staccato stock options. The Company paid an
    additional $7 million related to the achievement of
    operational objectives that was accounted for as additional
    goodwill, of which approximately $5 million was recorded in
    fiscal 2002. All of the contingent consideration had been paid
    as of November 2, 2002. An additional $0.2 million of
    compensation expense is being recorded annually through fiscal
    2005 related to the assumption of unvested stock options.

Pro forma results of operations for Neuroth, SPA,
IMI, ChipLogic and Staccato have not been provided herein as
they were not material to the Company on either an individual or
an aggregate basis. The results of operations of each
acquisition are included in the Company’s consolidated
statement of income from the date of each acquisition.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2000, the
Company acquired BCO Technologies plc (BCO), a company with
operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in a cash-for-stock
transaction valued at approximately $163 million. The
acquisition was accounted for as a purchase, and the excess of
the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired
was allocated to workforce in place and goodwill, which are
being amortized on the straight-line basis over five years. In
connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded
approximately $158 million of goodwill. There was no
in-process research and development write-off related to this
acquisition. Pro forma results of operations for BCO have not
been provided herein as they were not material to the Company.
The results of operations of this acquisition are included in
the Company’s consolidated statement of income from the
date of acquisition.

5.     Special
Charges

A summary of the Company’s special charges
is as follows:



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

A summary of the activity in accrued
restructuring is as follows:

During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, the
Company recorded special charges of approximately
$27.2 million (comprised of $28.7 million of second
quarter charges offset by $1.5 million related to a change
in estimate discussed below.) The second quarter charge was
comprised of $25.7 million related to the planned transfer
of production from the Company’s three older four-inch
wafer fabrication facilities to the Company’s three
six-inch and one eight-inch wafer fabrication facilities, and
$3 million primarily related to the impairment of an
investment, which was partially offset by an adjustment of
$1.5 million related to equipment cancellation fees
recorded in fiscal year 2001. The investment impairment, which
was related to an equity investment in a private company, was
due to the Company’s decision to abandon the product
strategy for which the investment was made. Included in the
$25.7 million special charge are severance and fringe
benefit costs of $15.3 million for 509 manufacturing
employees in the United States and Ireland, of which 182 of
these employees had been terminated as of November 2, 2002,
$2.3 million related to the write-down of equipment to be
abandoned and $8.1 million of other charges, primarily
related to lease termination and cleanup costs. The write-down
of equipment was principally due to our decision to discontinue
various product development strategies. This program is
proceeding in accordance with the Company’s original plan
and is expected to be substantially complete by the end of the
second quarter of fiscal 2003.

In addition, the remaining service lives of
certain assets within the older four-inch wafer fabrication
facilities have been shortened. As a result, depreciation
expense included in cost of sales in fiscal 2002 included
additional depreciation of approximately $8.7 million
associated with the shortened lives.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, the
Company recorded special charges of $12.8 million. The
charges included severance and fringe benefit costs of
$3.7 million related to cost reduction actions taken in
several product groups and, to a lesser extent, in
manufacturing, $3.8 million related to the impairment of an
investment, $3.4 million impairment of goodwill related to
the closure of an Austrian design center acquired in fiscal 2001
and $1.9 million primarily related to the abandonment of
equipment and lease cancellation fees. The investment
impairment, which related to an equity investment in a private
company, was due to the Company’s decision to abandon the
product strategy for which the investment was made. The
severance and fringe benefits costs were for approximately 70
engineering employees in the United States, Europe and Canada,
and approximately 30 manufacturing employees in the United
States. All of the manufacturing employees and approximately 32
of the engineering employees had been terminated as of
November 2, 2002. The Company expects to substantially
complete the above actions by the end of the first quarter of
fiscal 2003.



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, the
Company recorded special charges of approximately
$8.4 million. The charges included severance and fringe
benefit costs of $2.5 million related to cost reduction
actions taken in our sales group, several product groups and our
manufacturing testing area for approximately 65 employees in the
United States and Europe, of which 40 had been terminated as of
November 2, 2002. The charges also included
$2.1 million related to the impairment of investments,
$1.8 million primarily related to the abandonment of
equipment and lease cancellation fees and a change in estimate
of $2 million related to clean-up costs previously recorded
in the second quarter of fiscal 2002. The investment impairment
charges were related to the decline in fair value of a
publicly-traded equity investment below cost basis that was
determined to be other-than-temporary and of an equity
investment in a private company. The private company equity
investment was part of a product strategy the Company decided to
abandon. The Company expects to substantially complete this
action by the third quarter of fiscal 2003.

During fiscal 2001, the Company recorded special
charges of $47 million related to cost reduction actions
taken in response to the current economic climate. The actions
consisted of workforce reductions in manufacturing and, to a
lesser extent, in selling, marketing and administrative areas as
well as a decision to consolidate worldwide manufacturing
operations and rationalize production planning and quality
activities. The cost reductions included severance and fringe
benefit costs of $29.6 million for approximately 1,200
employees in the U.S., Europe, Asia and the Philippines of which
approximately 1,010 of these employees had been terminated as of
November 2, 2002. The remaining 190 employees are expected
to be terminated during the first quarter of fiscal 2003. As of
November 2, 2002, $23 million of the
$29.6 million aggregate severance cost obligations
pertaining to the fiscal 2001 worldwide cost reduction actions
had been paid. The special charge also included
$11.6 million related to the abandonment of equipment
resulting from the consolidation of worldwide manufacturing
operations and $5.8 million of other charges primarily
related to equipment and lease cancellation fees. Based on the
results of negotiations with vendors regarding purchase order
cancellation fees, the amount paid was $1.5 million less
that the amount recorded for such charges and accordingly, we
adjusted the provision for purchase order cancellation fees by
$1.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 to
reflect this change in estimate.

6.     Deferred
Compensation Plan Investments and Other Investments

During the first quarter of fiscal 2001, the
Company sold its investment in WaferTech, realizing a pretax
gain on the sale of this investment of approximately
$28 million. The Company had an equity investment in
Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Pte., Ltd. in Singapore of
approximately $27 million which represented a less than 5%
ownership interest. During fiscal 2000, the Company sold its
equity investment for $65 million, realizing a
$44 million gain over the original cost of
$21 million. These gains are included in other nonoperating
income.

Investments consist primarily of long-term
investments in mutual funds and bank money market funds, which
are related to the Company’s deferred compensation plan and
are offset by a corresponding noncurrent liability to the plan
participants (see Note 9). These investments are specifically
designated as available to the Company solely for the purpose of
paying benefits under the Company’s deferred compensation
plan. However, in the event the Company became insolvent, the
investments would be available to all unsecured general
creditors. These investments are classified as trading.

Investments are stated at fair value, which is
based on market quotes, interest rates or management estimates,
as appropriate. Adjustments to fair value of investments
classified as available-for-sale are recorded as an increase or
decrease in other comprehensive income, which is included as a
component of stockholders’ equity. Adjustments to fair
value of, and income pertaining to, other investments are
recorded in operating expense.

7.     Accrued
Liabilities

Accrued liabilities at November 2, 2002 and
November 3, 2001 consisted of the following:

8.     Debt and
Credit Facilities

Long-term debt at November 2, 2002 and
November 3, 2001 consisted of the following:

On October 1, 2000, the Company issued
$1,200 million of 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due
October 1, 2005 (the “2005 Notes”) with
semiannual interest payments on April 1 and October 1
of each year. The 2005 Notes are convertible, at the option of
the holder, into the Company’s common stock at any time
unless previously redeemed or repurchased, at a conversion price
of $129.78 per share, subject to adjustment in certain events.
The net proceeds of the offering were $1,172 million after
payment of the underwriting discount and expenses of the
offering, which will be amortized over the term of the 2005
Notes.

Other long-term debt of $27.4 million is due
to a third-party counterparty and is related to the interest
rate swap on the 2005 Notes entered into in fiscal 2002 (see
Note 2i.) The swap is designed to terminate if the 2005
Notes are converted or redeemed early. As consideration for the
restructuring of the interest rate swap agreement in the
Company’s favor in October 2002, the Company agreed to pay
a fixed amount to the counterparty that is due regardless of
when the interest rate swap agreement terminates. This
obligation is payable, plus interest at the LIBOR-based floating
rate (1.61% as of November 6, 2002), on a quarterly basis
over the same term as that of the interest rate swap, but the
full amount is accelerated should the swap terminate prior to
its contractual maturity.

There were $6 thousand and
$434 thousand of other short-term borrowings outstanding at
November 2, 2002 and November 3, 2001, respectively,
which were at prevailing market rates for the respective
currencies. Borrowings under the Company’s lines of credit
are generally due within six months.

9.

Deferred Compensation Plan Liability and Other
    Noncurrent Liabilities

The deferred compensation plan liability relates
to obligations due under the Analog Devices, Inc. Deferred
Compensation Plan (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”).
The Deferred Compensation Plan allows certain members of
management and other highly-compensated employees and
non-employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of
their compensation and gains on stock options and restricted
stock granted before July 23, 1997. The balance represents
Deferred Compensation Plan participant accumulated deferrals,
and earnings thereon, since the inception of the Deferred
Compensation Plan. The Company’s liability under the
Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded and unsecured general
obligation of the Company. The other items included in other
noncurrent liabilities primarily relate to pension liabilities.

10.     Lease
Commitments

The Company leases certain of its facilities and
equipment under various operating and capital leases that expire
at various dates through 2020. The lease agreements frequently
include renewal and escalation clauses and purchase provisions
and require the Company to pay taxes, insurance and maintenance
costs. Total rental expense under operating leases was
approximately $21 million in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001
and $19 million in fiscal 2000.

The following is a schedule of future minimum
lease payments under capital leases and rental payments required
under long-term operating leases at November 2, 2002:

11.     Commitments
and Contingencies

Litigation

The Company is a defendant in a federal lawsuit
brought in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California (the “Court”) by Linear
Technology Corporation (“LTC”). On June 26, 1997,
LTC filed suit against the Company, Impala Linear Corporation,
Toyoda Automatic Loom Works, Ltd., Maxim Integrated Products,
Inc. and Unitrode Corporation alleging patent infringement and
seeking injunctive relief and unspecified damages. The case was
originally scheduled for trial on liability issues beginning on
September 7, 1999. The original district judge recused
himself and the case was reassigned three times before the Court
granted several motions for summary judgment of non-infringement
in favor of the defendants in September 2001. The Court also
denied LTC’s motion for summary judgment of infringement
and willful infringement against the Company. On October 4,
2001, the Court indicated that it would stay the matter and
certify similar issues as to the Company to allow all parties to
take appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit (“Federal Circuit”). LTC, Maxim and
Unitrode filed cross appeals with the Federal Circuit. On
November 1, 2001, LTC and the Company jointly petitioned
the Federal Circuit to permit them to address the issues
certified for appeal. On February 15, 2002, the Federal
Circuit dismissed all of the appeals due to improper
certification and denied the petition of LTC and the Company for
permission to appeal. On June 4, 2002, LTC and the Company
filed a stipulation of dismissal and proposed order dismissing
all of LTC’s claims against the Company without prejudice.
The judge issued an order on June 6, 2002, dismissing the
case against Company without prejudice. While the renewed
appeals of the other defendants include a challenge to the
propriety of the dismissal of the Company being without
prejudice, this matter is formally concluded as to the Company.

On June 17, 2002, the Company received a
letter from Plasma Physics Corporation (“Plasma
Physics”) attaching a courtesy copy of a complaint it had
filed against the Company in the Eastern District of New York
alleging infringement by certain of the Company’s products
of two patents held by Plasma Physics. In the letter, Plasma
Physics indicated that it would like to license the patents to
the Company. The letter further



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

stated that Plasma Physics would forego service
of the complaint for a period of 120 days, provided that
the Company would agree to undertake negotiations over terms for
licensing the above-referenced patents. The Company met with
Plasma Physics, and those negotiations are ongoing. On
October 17, 2002, Plasma Physics served the complaint.
Analog has answered the complaint denying the allegations, and
the litigation is in its early stages.

On October 7, 2002, Townshend Intellectual
Property, L.L.C. (“Townshend”) commenced an action in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California against the Company, alleging that the Company
infringed eight patents, alleged to be owned by Townshend.
Townshend’s complaint alleges that the Company’s
Standalone Embedded Modems and Single Chip Internet Modems
infringe those patents. The complaint seeks injunctive relief
and unspecified damages. By letter dated October 16, 2002,
the Company sought indemnification from Lucent Technologies,
Inc. (“Lucent”). Lucent has denied that it has any
indemnification obligations to the Company. The Company filed an
Answer to the complaint with the Court, on or about
December 12, 2002, denying infringement and liability. The
Company continues to evaluate issues with regard to defenses and
counterclaims, as well as indemnification issues with respect to
Lucent.

The Company is currently under audit by the
United States Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) for
fiscal year 1999 and fiscal year 2000. The audit has not been
completed and the IRS has not issued a report on its audit.

From time to time as a normal incidence of the
nature of the Company’s business, various claims, charges
and litigation are asserted or commenced against the Company
arising from, or related to, contractual matters, patents,
trademarks, personal injury, environmental matters, product
liability, insurance coverage and personnel and employment
disputes. As to such claims and litigation, including those
items discussed above, the Company can give no assurance that it
will prevail. However, the Company does not believe that these
matters will have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s consolidated financial position, although an
adverse outcome of any of these matters could have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of
operations or cash flows in the quarter, or annual period in
which one or more of these matters are resolved.

12.     Stockholders’
Equity

Stock Plans

On December 5, 2001, the Board of Directors
approved the 2001 Broad-Based Stock Option Plan (2001 Plan),
which provides for the issuance of stock options to purchase up
to 50 million shares of common stock. The 2001 Plan
provides for the issuance of stock options to non-officer
employees, consultants and advisors at a price not less than
100% of the fair market value of the common stock at the time
the option is granted. The Company cannot grant options under
the 2001 Plan to directors or officers.

In fiscal 1998, the stockholders approved the
1998 Stock Option Plan (1998 Plan), which provides for the
issuance of nonstatutory and incentive stock options to purchase
up to 30 million shares of common stock. In March 2000, the
stockholders approved an amendment to the 1998 Plan to increase
the shares reserved for issuance by an additional
34 million shares. Officers, employees, directors,
consultants and advisors of the Company and its subsidiaries are
eligible to be granted options under this plan at a price not
less than 100% (110% in the case of incentive stock options
granted to 10% or greater stockholders) of the fair market value
of the common stock at the time the option is granted. The
Company’s 1988 Stock Option Plan (the “1988
Plan”) was terminated upon adoption of the 1998 Plan;
however, options to purchase common stock remain outstanding
under the 1988 Plan.

While the Company may grant to employees options
that become exercisable at different times or within different
periods, the Company has generally granted to employees options
that are exercisable on a cumulative basis in annual
installments of 33 1/3% on each of the third, fourth and
fifth anniversaries of the date

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

of grant or in annual installments of 25% on each
of the second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date
of grant.

Under the 1994 Director Option Plan, which was
restated in 1998, and subsequently amended, each non-employee
director was granted annually a non-statutory option to purchase
21,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to the
fair market value on the date of grant. Up to 1999, each newly
elected non-employee director received a grant of an option to
purchase 21,000 shares of common stock upon his or her election
to the Board (each, an “Initial Grant”). The 1994
Director Option Plan was amended in 1999 whereby the number of
shares of common stock underlying each Initial Grant was
increased from 21,000 to 60,000. On December 8, 1999, the
1994 Director Option Plan was terminated (effective
March 14, 2000), and the Board of Directors authorized that
from and after March 14, 2000, all options granted to
non-employee directors will be granted under the 1998 Plan,
under which each non-employee director is granted annually a
non-statutory stock option to purchase 20,000 shares (25,000
shares prior to fiscal year 2001) of common stock at an exercise
price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant. The
options granted to directors under the 1998 Plan, as well as the
options previously granted under the 1994 Director Option Plan,
are exercisable on a cumulative basis in annual installments of
33 1/3% on each of the first, second and third
anniversaries of the date of grant.

Information with respect to activity under the
stock option plans is set forth below:



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following table summarizes information about
options outstanding at November 2, 2002:

The Company has an employee stock purchase plan
(ESPP) that allows eligible employees to purchase, through
payroll deductions, shares of the Company’s common stock at
85% of the fair market value at specified dates. Employees
purchased a total of 436,885 shares of common stock under this
plan in fiscal 2002 (390,719 shares and 1,011,624 shares in
fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000, respectively) for a total purchase
price of $13.6 million ($15.2 million and
$16.5 million in fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000,
respectively). At November 2, 2002, approximately 2,554,000
common shares, net of retirements, remained available for
issuance under the ESPP.

Under the 1991 Restricted Stock Plan, which
expired in December 2000, a maximum of 5,400,000 shares of
common stock were authorized for awards by the Company to key
employees for nominal consideration. Shares awarded under the
plan were restricted as to transfer, usually for a period of
five years and, under certain conditions, were subject to
repurchase by the Company at the original purchase price per
share. During fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, $0.9 million,
$2.1 million, and $2.2 million, respectively, of
compensation expense was recorded in connection with grants made
under this plan. As of November 2, 2002, approximately
510,000 common shares were outstanding under the 1991 Restricted
Stock Plan.

As of November 2, 2002, a total of
132,410,000 common shares were reserved for issuance under the
Company’s stock plans.

Common Stock Repurchase

In August 2002, the Company’s Board of
Directors approved the repurchase of up to 15 million
shares of common stock. As of November 2, 2002, the Company
had purchased 4,350,100 shares of its common stock at an average
purchase price of $22.47 per share. The repurchased shares are
held as treasury shares and are being used for the employee
stock purchase plan and other benefit plans.

Stock-Based Compensation

As permitted under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123 (FAS 123),
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” the Company
has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and related Interpretations, in accounting for
stock-based awards to employees. Under APB 25, the Company
generally recognizes no compensation expense with respect to
such awards.

Pro forma information regarding net income and
earnings per share is required by FAS 123 for awards
granted after October 28, 1995 as if the Company had
accounted for its stock-based awards to employees under the fair
value method of FAS 123. The fair value of the
Company’s stock-based awards to employees was estimated
using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting
restrictions and are fully

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

transferable. In addition, option valuation
models require the input of highly subjective assumptions,
including the expected stock price volatility. Because the
Company’s stock-based awards to employees have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions
can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
management’s opinion, the existing models do not
necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value
of its stock-based awards to employees. The fair value of the
Company’s stock-based awards to employees was estimated
assuming no expected dividends and the following weighted
average assumptions:

The following is a summary of weighted average
grant date values generated by application of the Black-Scholes
model:

As required under FAS 123, the reported net
(loss) income and basic and diluted earnings per share have
been presented to reflect the impact had the Company been
required to include the amortization of the Black-Scholes option
value as expense. For purposes of this disclosure, the estimated
fair value of the options is amortized to expense over the
options’ vesting periods. The Company’s pro forma
information follows:

The effects of applying FAS 123 on pro forma
disclosures are not likely to be representative of the effects
on pro forma disclosures of future years.

Preferred Stock

The Company has 471,934 authorized shares of
$1.00 par value preferred stock. The Board of Directors is
authorized to fix designations, relative rights, preferences and
limitations on the preferred stock at the time of issuance. An
aggregate of 300,000 shares of preferred stock have been
designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock
for issuance in connection with the Company’s Stockholder
Rights Plan.

Common Stock Purchase Rights

In March 1998, the Board of Directors adopted a
Stockholder Rights Plan (the Stockholder Rights Plan) that
replaced a plan adopted by the Board in 1988. Pursuant to the
Stockholder Rights Plan, after giving effect to the
Company’s two-for-one stock split effected on
March 15, 2000, each share of the Company’s common
stock currently has an associated one-half of a right. Under
certain circumstances, each whole right would



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

entitle the registered holder to purchase from
the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $180
in cash, subject to adjustment.

The rights are not exercisable and cannot be
transferred separately from the common stock until ten business
days (or such later date as may be determined by the Board of
Directors) after (i) the public announcement that a person
or group of affiliated or associated persons has acquired (or
obtained rights to acquire) beneficial ownership of 15% or more
of common stock or (ii) the commencement of a tender offer
or exchange offer that would result in a person or group
beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding common stock.
If and when the rights become exercisable, each holder of a
right shall have the right to receive, upon exercise, that
number of shares of common stock (or in certain circumstances,
cash, property or other securities of the Company) that equals
the exercise price of the right divided by 50% of the current
market price (as defined in the Stockholder Rights Plan) per
share of common stock at the date of the occurrence of such
event. In the event that at any time after any person becomes an
acquiring person, (i) the Company is consolidated with, or
merged with and into, another entity and the Company is not the
surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or if the
Company is the surviving entity, but shares of its outstanding
common stock are changed or exchanged for stock or securities or
cash or any other property, or (ii) 50% or more of the
Company’s assets or earning power is sold or transferred,
each holder of a right shall thereafter have the right to
receive upon exercise, that number of shares of common stock of
the acquiring company that equals the exercise price of the
right divided by 50% of the current market price of such common
stock at the date of the occurrence of the event.

The rights have certain anti-takeover effects, in
that they would cause substantial dilution to a person or group
that attempts to acquire a significant interest in the Company
on terms not approved by the Board of Directors. The rights
expire on March 17, 2008 but may be redeemed by the Company
for $.001 per right at any time prior to the tenth day following
a person’s acquisition of 15% or more of the Company’s
common stock. So long as the rights are not separately
transferable, each new share of common stock issued will have
one-half of a right associated with it.

13.     Retirement
Plans

The Company and its subsidiaries have various
savings and retirement plans covering substantially all
employees. The Company maintains a defined contribution plan for
the benefit of its eligible United States employees. This plan
provides for Company contributions of up to 5% of each
participant’s total eligible compensation. In addition, the
Company contributes an amount equal to each participant’s
pre-tax contribution, if any, up to a maximum of 3% of each
participant’s total eligible compensation. The Company also
has various defined benefit pension and other retirement plans
for certain non-U.S. employees that are consistent with local
statutes and practices. The total expense related to all of the
Company’s retirement plans was approximately
$28 million in each of fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 and
$26 million in fiscal year 2000, which primarily consisted
of costs related to the U.S. defined contribution plan. Also
included in total expense is pension expense related to non-U.S.
defined benefit plans of approximately $4 million in fiscal
2002 and $3 million for each of the fiscal years 2001 and
2000.

Non-U.S. Plan Disclosures

The Company’s funding policy for its foreign
defined benefit pension plans is consistent with the local
requirements of each country. The plans’ assets consist
primarily of U.S. and non-U.S. equity securities, bonds,
property and cash.

$23.3 million, $16.9 million and $11.5 million,
respectively, at November 3, 2001.

The range of assumptions used for the non-U.S.
defined benefit plans reflects the different economic
environments within the various countries. The projected benefit
obligation was determined using the following assumptions:

Taxes

The reconciliation of income tax computed at the
U.S. federal statutory rates to income tax expense is as follows:



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

For financial reporting purposes, income before
income taxes includes the following components:

The components of the provision for income taxes
are as follows:

The Company’s practice is to reinvest
indefinitely the earnings of certain international subsidiaries.
Accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided for
approximately $1,055 million of unremitted earnings of
international subsidiaries. As of November 2, 2002, the
amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these
unremitted earnings was $230 million. At November 2,
2002, the Company had general business credit carryovers of
approximately $15.6 million that begin to expire in 2021,
and a foreign tax credit of approximately $7 million that
will expire in 2008.



ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The significant components of the Company’s
deferred tax assets and liabilities for the fiscal years ended
November 2, 2002 and November 3, 2001 are as follows:

The Company has provided for potential
liabilities due in various foreign jurisdictions. Judgment is
required in determining the worldwide income tax expense
provision. In the ordinary course of global business, there are
many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax
outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a
consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related
entities. Although the Company believes its estimates are
reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome
of these matters will not be different than that which is
reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals.
Such differences could have a material impact on the
Company’s income tax provision and operating results in the
period in which such determination is made.

15.     Related Party
Transactions

Certain of the Company’s directors are
affiliated with companies that sell products to the Company.
Management believes the terms and prices for the purchases of
these products are no less favorable than those obtained from
unaffiliated parties. One of the Company’s directors became
a director of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company
(TSMC) during fiscal 2002. The Company purchased
approximately $206 million of product from TSMC in fiscal
year 2002, and approximately $19 million was payable to
TSMC as of November 2, 2002. Management anticipates the
Company will make similar purchases in fiscal year 2003.
