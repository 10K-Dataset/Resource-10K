Our
Distribution segment consists of 19 company-owned and 22 joint venture distributors that service and distribute the full range of our products and services to end-users
at approximately 380 locations in approximately 70 distribution territories. Our company-owned distributors are located
in key markets, including North America, Australia, Europe, the Middle East, India, China, Africa, Russia, Brazil, Singapore and Japan.

The
Distribution segment is organized into four primary geographic regions:

•

Asia Pacific,

•

EMEA,

•

North and Central America and

•

South America.

Asia
Pacific and EMEA are composed of seven smaller regional distributor organizations (South Pacific, India, China, Northeast/Southeast Asia, Greater Europe, the Middle East and Africa)
which allow us to better manage these vast geographic territories.

North
and Central America, is mostly comprised of a network of partially-owned distributors. Internationally, our network consists of independent, partially-owned and wholly-owned
distributors. Through this network, we provide parts and service to our customers. These full-service solutions include maintenance contracts, engineering services and integrated products,
where we customize our products to cater to specific needs of end-users. Our distributors also serve and develop dealers, predominantly OEM dealers, in their territories by providing new
products, technical support, tools, training, parts and product information.

In
addition to managing our investments in wholly-owned and partially-owned distributors, our Distribution segment is responsible for managing the performance and capabilities of our
independent distributors. Our Distribution segment serves a highly diverse customer base with approximately 42 percent of their 2010 revenues being generated from the sale of new engines and
power generation equipment, compared to 44 percent in 2009, and the remaining revenue generated by parts and service revenue.

Financial
information about our distributors accounted for under the equity method are incorporated by reference from Note 2, "INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INVESTEES," to our

Consolidated Financial Statements

.



In November 2010, we purchased a majority interest in a previously independent North American distributorship. The acquisition was accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting and resulted in an aggregate purchase price of $27 million. The assets of the acquired business were primarily accounts receivable, inventory, and fixed assets.
The transaction generated $1 million of goodwill.

On
January 4, 2010, we acquired the remaining 70 percent interest in Cummins Western Canada (CWC) from our former principal for consideration of approximately
$71 million in order to increase our ownership interests in key portions of the distribution channel. We formed a new partnership with a new distributor principal where we own 80 percent
of CWC and the new distributor principal owns 20 percent. The acquisition was effective on January 1, 2010, and was accounted for as a business combination. The results of the acquired
entity were included in the Distribution operating segment as of the acquisition date including $2 million of goodwill. The assets of the acquired business were primarily inventory, fixed
assets and accounts receivable. See Note 21, "ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES," to the

Consolidated Financial Statements

for additional detail.

Our
distributors compete with distributors or dealers that offer similar products. In many cases, these competing distributors or dealers are owned by, or affiliated with the companies
that are listed above as competitors of our Engine, Power Generation or Components segments. These competitors vary by geographical location.

JOINT VENTURES, ALLIANCES AND NON-WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES

We have entered into a number of joint venture agreements and alliances with business partners around the world. Our joint ventures are
either distribution or manufacturing entities. We also own controlling interests in non-wholly-owned manufacturing and distribution subsidiaries. We have three approximately
80 percent owned entities that are consolidated in the Distribution segment as well as several manufacturing joint ventures in the other operating segments.

In
the event of a change of control of either party to these joint ventures and other strategic alliances, certain consequences may result including automatic termination and liquidation
of the venture, exercise of "put" or "call" rights of ownership by the non-acquired partner, termination or transfer of technology license rights to the non-acquired partner
and increases in component transfer prices to the acquired partner. We will continue to evaluate joint venture and partnership opportunities in order to penetrate new markets, develop new products and
generate manufacturing and operational efficiencies.

Financial
information about our investments in joint ventures and alliances is incorporated by reference from Note 2, "INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INVESTEES," and Note 24,
"VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES," to the

Consolidated Financial Statements.

and fuel systems. We single source approximately 60 to 70 percent of the total types of parts in our product designs. We have long-term agreements with critical suppliers to assure
the right capacity, delivery and quality. Although we elect to source a relatively high proportion of our total raw materials and
component requirements from sole suppliers, we have established a process to annually review our sourcing strategies with a focus on the reduction of risk, which has led us to dual source critical
components, where possible. We are also developing suppliers in many global or emerging markets to serve our businesses across the globe and provide alternative sources in the event of disruption from
existing suppliers.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

We own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture. These patents and trademarks
were granted and registered over a period of years. Although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations, we do not believe any patent, group of patents, or
trademark (other than our leading brand house trademarks) is considered significant to our business.

SEASONALITY

While individual product lines may experience modest seasonal declines in production, there is no material effect on the demand for the
majority of our products on a quarterly basis with the exception that our Power Generation segment normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter due to general declines in construction
spending during this period and our Distribution segment normally experiences seasonal declines in first quarter business activity due to holiday periods in Asia and Australia.

LARGEST CUSTOMERS

We have thousands of customers around the world and have developed long-standing business relationships with many of them.
We have long-term heavy-duty engine supply agreements with PACCAR and Volvo Trucks North America. We have mid-range supply agreements with PACCAR, as



its
exclusive engine supplier, as well as with Daimler Trucks North America (formerly Freightliner LLC), Ford and MAN (formerly Volkswagen). We also have an agreement with Chrysler for
supplying the engine for use in Dodge Ram trucks. In our off-highway markets, Cummins has various engine and component supply agreements ranging across our midrange and
high-horsepower businesses with Komatsu Ltd., as well as various joint ventures and other license agreements in our Engine, Component and Distribution segments. Collectively, our
net sales to these seven customers was approximately 25 percent of consolidated net sales in 2010, compared to approximately 23 percent in 2009 and 22 percent in 2008 and
individually was less than eight percent of consolidated net sales to any single customer in 2010, compared to less than nine percent and less than eight percent in 2009 and 2008, respectively. These
agreements contain standard purchase and sale agreement terms covering engine and engine parts pricing, quality and delivery commitments, as well as engineering product support obligations. The basic
nature of our agreements with OEM customers is that they are long-term price and operations agreements that assure the availability of our products to each customer through the duration of
the respective agreements. Agreements with most OEMs contain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach, change of control or
insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party.

BACKLOG

As a result of the improving economy in 2010, our lead times increased from their lower levels during the recession. While we have
supply agreements with some truck and off-highway equipment OEMs, most of our business is transacted through open purchase orders. These open orders are historically subject to
month-to-month releases and are subject to cancellation on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE

Our research and development program is focused on product improvements, innovations and cost reductions for our customers. We expense
research and development expenditures, net of contract reimbursements, when incurred. Research and development expenses, net of contract reimbursements, were $402 million in 2010,
$362 million in 2009 and $422 million in 2008. Contract reimbursements were $68 million in 2010, $92 million in 2009 and $61 million in 2008.

For
2010, 2009 and 2008, approximately $38 million, $151 million and $116 million or 9 percent, 42 percent and 27 percent respectively, were
directly related to compliance with 2010 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emission standards. For 2010, approximately $36 million or 9 percent was directly related to compliance
with 2013 EPA emission standards. In 2010, we increased research, development and engineering expenses as we continued to invest in future critical technologies and products. We will continue to make
investments to improve our current technologies, to continue to meet the future emission requirements around the world and improve fuel economy.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

Sustainability

We continue to be a leader in sustainable business development and practices. We have invested significantly in new products and
technologies designed to further lower emission and increase fuel efficiency from our products. We have increased our commitment to addressing the global impact of climate change through the
structured approach of our 10 climate change principles developed last year that address ways we are becoming a greater part of the solution. We have worked collaboratively with customers to improve
their fuel economy and reduce their carbon footprint. We have significantly reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from our facilities through a strong energy efficiency program and we met our
publically stated goal of 25 percent intensity reduction after complete 2010 goal-year



environmental
data was verified. We have taken leadership positions on climate change by articulating our positions on key public policy issues surrounding climate change. For the sixth consecutive
year, we were named to the Dow Jones World Sustainability Index, which recognizes the top 10 percent of the world's largest 2,500 companies in economic, environmental and social leadership. Our
sustainability report for 2010 is available on our website at www.cummins.com.

Product Environmental Compliance

Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing
emission and noise. Our products comply with all current emission standards that the EPA, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and other state and international regulatory agencies have
established for heavy-duty on-highway diesel and gas engines and off-highway engines. Our ability to comply with these and future emission standards is an essential
element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets. We have made, and will continue to make, significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards. Failure to
comply with these standards could result in adverse effects on our future financial results.

EPA Engine Certifications

The current on-highway emission standards came into effect in the U.S. on January 1, 2010. To meet the 2010 U.S. EPA
heavy-duty
on-highway emission standards, we used an evolution of our proven 2007 technology solution to maintain power and torque with substantial fuel economy improvement and maintenance intervals
comparable with our 2007 compliant engines. We offer a complete lineup of on-highway engines to meet the near-zero emission standards. Mid-range and
heavy-duty engines for EPA 2010 require nitrogen oxide (NOx) aftertreatment. NOx reduction is achieved by an integrated technology solution comprised of the XPI High Pressure Common Rail
fuel system, Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) technology, next-generation cooled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), advanced electronic controls, proven air handling and the Cummins
Particulate Filter. The EPA and CARB have certified that our engines meet the 2010 emission requirements. Emission standards in international markets, including Europe, Japan, Mexico, Australia,
Brazil, India and China are becoming more stringent. We believe that our experience in meeting U.S. emission standards leaves us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as
the need for emission control capability grows.

Federal
and California regulations require manufacturers to report failures of emission-related components to the EPA and CARB when the failure rate reaches a specified level. At higher
failure rates, a product recall may be required. In 2010, we submitted eleven reports to the EPA relating to software corrections in the engine control module and to the exhaust aftertreatment system.
The software corrections related to the engine control module and exhaust aftertreatment system necessitated the campaigns of approximately 11,400 and 6,310 engines, respectively.

Other Environmental Statutes and Regulations

Expenditures for environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the U.S. have not been a
substantial portion of our annual capital outlays and are not expected to be material in 2011. Except as follows, we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations
applicable to our plants and operations.

In
the U.S., pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies and/or defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions, we have been identified as a potentially
responsible party (PRP) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended or similar state laws, at approximately 20 waste disposal sites. Based upon
our experiences at similar sites we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be significant. We have



established
accruals that we believe are adequate for our expected future liability with respect to these sites.

In
addition, we have four other sites where we are working with governmental authorities on remediation projects. The costs for these remediation projects are not expected to be
material.

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2010, we employed approximately 39,200 persons worldwide. Approximately 15,500 of our employees worldwide are

ITEM 1A.    Risk Factors

Set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are some of the principal risks and uncertainties
that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this Report and could individually or combined have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations, financial position and cash flows. These risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this Report, including
statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Our separate section above, "CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
INFORMATION," should be considered in addition to the following statements.

The discovery of any significant problems with our new engine platforms in North America could materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and
cash flows.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and California Air Resources Board (CARB) have certified all of our 2011
on-highway and off-highway engines, which utilize selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology to meet requisite emission levels. We introduced SCR technology into our engine platforms
in 2010. The effective performance of SCR technology and the overall performance of these engine platforms impact a number of our operating segments and remain crucial to our success in North America.
While the model year 2010 engine platforms have performed well in the field and the 2011 model year engines have undergone extensive testing, the discovery of any significant problems in these
platforms could result in recall campaigns, increased warranty costs, reputational risk and brand risk.

Another downturn in our markets could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows again.

Although the emerging markets, including China, India and Brazil, recovered in 2010, the global economy remains fragile, with North
America and other developed countries continuing to experience sluggish results and certain countries in Europe experiencing a debt crisis. If the global economy were to take another significant
downturn, depending upon the length, duration and severity of such a downturn, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow would almost certainly be materially adversely affected
again. Specifically, our revenues would likely decrease, we may be forced to consider further restructuring actions, we may need to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, our days sales
outstanding may increase and we could experience impairments to assets of certain of our businesses.

Another downturn in the North American and European automotive industries could adversely impact our business.

A number of companies in the global automotive industry have experienced significant financial difficulties in recent years. In North
America, General Motors Corporation ("GM"), Ford Motor Company and Chrysler Group, LLC ("Chrysler") experienced declining markets; furthermore, GM and Chrysler previously filed for, and then
exited, bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code and accepted substantial monetary infusions from the U.S. government. Automakers across Europe and Japan also experienced
difficulties from a weakened economy and tightening credit



markets.
Because many of our suppliers also supply automotive industry participants, the difficult automotive industry conditions also adversely affected our supply base. During the recession, lower
production levels for some of our key suppliers, increases in certain raw material, commodity and energy costs and the global credit market crisis resulted in severe financial distress among many
companies within the automotive supply base. A return to financial distress within the automotive industry and our shared supply base and/or the subsequent bankruptcy of one or more additional
automakers may lead to further supplier bankruptcies, commercial disputes, supply chain interruptions, supplier requests for company sponsored capital support or a collapse of the supply chain.

We rely on income from investees that we do not directly control.

Our net income includes significant equity, royalty and interest income from investees that we do not directly control. For 2010, we
recognized $351 million of equity, royalty and interest income from investees, compared to $214 million in 2009. The majority of our equity, royalty and interest income from investees
comes from our 12 unconsolidated North American distributors, and from two of our joint ventures in China, Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. ("DCEC") and Chongqing Cummins Engine
Company, Ltd. ("CCEC"). Our equity ownership interests in our unconsolidated North American distributors generally range from 30 percent to 50 percent. We have 50 percent
equity ownership interests in DCEC and CCEC. As a result, although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities, we do not unilaterally control their
management or operations, which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these other entities. A significant reduction in the level of contribution by
these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Government regulation could adversely affect our business.

Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emission and noise, including standards imposed by
the EPA, the European Union, state regulatory agencies, such as the CARB and other regulatory agencies around the world. We have made, and will be required to continue to make, significant capital and
research expenditures to comply with these regulatory standards. Developing engines to meet changing government regulatory requirements, with different implementation timelines and emission
requirements, makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets. In some cases,
we may be required to develop new products to comply with new regulations, particularly those relating to air emission. For example, we were required to develop new engines to comply with stringent
emission standards in the U.S. by January 1, 2010, including the reduction of NOx emission to near zero levels, among other requirements. While we were able to meet this and previous deadlines,
our ability to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our position in the engine markets we serve. Further, the successful development and
introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks, such as delays in product development, cost over-runs and
unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties.

Our truck manufacturers and OEM customers may not continue to outsource their engine supply needs.

Several of our engine customers, including PACCAR Inc., Volvo AB and Chrysler, are truck manufacturers or OEMs that
manufacture engines for some of their own products. Despite their engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to
the quality of our engine products, our emission capability, our systems integration, their customers' preferences, their desire for cost reductions, their desire for eliminating production risks and
their desire to maintain company focus. However, there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource, or outsource as much of, their engine production in the



future.
Increased levels of OEM vertical integration could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers' business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another engine
manufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. Any significant reduction
in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or OEM customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs.

Our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames; however, the timing of market price
increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions. Additionally, higher material and commodity costs around the world may offset our
efforts to reduce our cost structure. While we customarily enter into financial transactions to address some of these risks (i.e. copper, platinum and palladium), there can be no assurance that
commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, while the use of commodity price hedging instruments may provide us
with protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price. As a result,
higher material and commodity costs, as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices, could result in declining margins.

We are subject to currency exchange rate and other related risks.

We conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to
currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, since our financial statements are denominated in U.S.
dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. While we customarily enter into
financial transactions to address these risks, there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash
flows. In addition, while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially
forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

We
also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or
to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds
denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.

We are vulnerable to supply shortages from single-sourced suppliers.

During 2010, we single sourced approximately 60 to 70 percent of the total types of parts in our product designs. Any delay in
our suppliers' deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations, forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions. Delays may be caused by
factors affecting our suppliers, including capacity constraints, labor disputes, economic downturns, availability of credit, the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, suppliers'
allocations to other purchasers, weather emergencies or acts of war or terrorism. Any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers.



Our products are subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues.

Our products may be subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. Product recalls subject us to harm to our reputation,
loss of current and future customers, reduced revenue and product recall costs. Product recall costs are incurred when we decide, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to recall a product through a
formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue.

We face significant competition in the markets we serve.

The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that
produce and sell similar products. We primarily compete in the market with diesel engines and related diesel products; however, new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline and other
technologies and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies. Our products primarily compete on the basis of price, performance, fuel economy, speed of delivery, quality
and customer support. We also face competitors in some emerging markets who have established local practices and long standing relationships with participants in these markets. There can be no
assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets. For a more complete discussion of the competitive environment in which each
of our segments operates, see "Operating Segments" in "Item 1 Business."

We are exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business.

Approximately 64 percent of our net sales for 2010 were attributable to customers outside the U.S., compared to
52 percent in 2009. Accordingly, our business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries. These risks
include:

•

the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;

•

trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;

•

the imposition of taxes on foreign income and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the U.S.;

•

the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions;

•

difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations;

•

required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; and

•

changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets.

As
we continue to operate our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. There can be no
assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us.

Significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows.

We sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans. Our pension expense and
the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to
measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a



present
value. We could experience increased pension expense due to a combination of factors, including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets, decreases in the discount rate and
changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets.

Significant
declines in future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets, which could result in increased pension expense in future
years and adverse changes to our financial condition. Depending upon the severity of market declines and government regulatory changes, we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the U.S.
and perhaps other countries, and these contributions could be material.

We face reputational and legal risk from operation outside the U.S. and affiliations with joint venture partners

Several of our foreign subsidiaries, affiliates and joint venture partners are located outside the U.S. with laws, rules and business
practices that differ from those of the U.S. The activities of these entities may not comply with U.S. laws or customs or our Code of Business Conduct and actions by these entities may cause us legal
or reputational risk if they violate applicable laws, rules or business practices.

We face the challenge of increasing our capacity and ramping up our production at the appropriate pace as we exit the downturn.

Prior to the recession, we experienced capacity constraints and longer lead times for certain products. Accurately forecasting our
expected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity as we exit the downturn have been, and will continue to be, important factors in determining our results of operations. We cannot guarantee
that we will be able to increase manufacturing capacity to a level that meets demand for our products, which could prevent us from meeting increased customer demand and could harm our business.
However, if we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity, we may have significantly underutilized assets and we may experience reduced margins. If we do not accurately align our manufacturing
capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our business is exposed to risks of product liability claims.

We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products' failure to perform to
specification results, or is alleged to result in property damage, bodily injury and/or death. We may experience material product liability losses in the future. While we maintain insurance coverage
with respect to certain product liability claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage
against product liability claims. In addition, product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time,
regardless of the ultimate outcome. An unsuccessful defense of a significant product liability claim could have a material adverse effect upon us. In addition, even if we are successful in defending
against a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us.

We may need to write off significant investments in our new light-duty diesel engine platforms if customer commitments further deteriorate.

We began development of a new light-duty diesel engine platform in July 2006 to be used in a variety of on- and
off-highway applications. Since that time, and as of December 31, 2010, we have capitalized investments of approximately $218 million. Market uncertainty due to the global
recession resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs, while others remain active. If customer expectations or volume projections further deteriorate from our current
levels and we do not



identify
new customers, we may need to recognize an impairment charge and write the assets down to net realizable value.

Our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations.

Our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we
operate, including laws and regulations governing air emission, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. While we believe
that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with
respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations, under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. We are also subject to laws requiring the
cleanup of contaminated property. If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of
hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material.

Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our
profitability.

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. Our income tax provision and cash tax liability in
the future could be adversely affected by changes in the distribution of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities,
changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. The carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the U.S., is
dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require
an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us.
We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits
could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision.

We may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters.

As of December 31, 2010, we employed approximately 39,200 persons worldwide. Approximately 15,500 of our employees worldwide are
represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2011 and 2015. While we have no reason to believe that we will be impacted by work stoppages and other labor
matters, there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages, or other types of conflicts with
labor unions or our employees. Any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. In addition, many of our customers and suppliers
have unionized work forces. Work stoppages or slow-downs experienced by our customers or suppliers could result in slow-downs or closures that would have a material adverse
effect on our operations.



Our financial statements are subject to changes in accounting standards that could adversely impact our profitability or financial position.

Our financial statements are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(GAAP), which are periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including
the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Recently, accounting standard setters issued new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to revenue recognition
and lease accounting as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures. The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual and
quarterly reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. An assessment of proposed standards is not provided, as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure
process and, therefore, their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed. It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current
accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on the reported results of operations and financial position.

ITEM 3.    Legal Proceedings

We are subject to numerous lawsuits and claims arising out of the ordinary course of our business, including actions related to product
liability; personal injury; the use and performance of our products; warranty matters; patent, trademark or other intellectual property infringement; contractual liability; the conduct of our
business; tax reporting in foreign jurisdictions; distributor termination; workplace safety; and environmental matters. We also have been identified as a potentially responsible party at multiple
waste disposal sites under U.S. federal and related state environmental statutes and regulations and may have joint and several liability for any investigation and remediation costs incurred with
respect to such sites. We have denied liability with respect to many of these lawsuits, claims and proceedings and are vigorously defending such lawsuits, claims and proceedings. We carry various
forms of commercial, property and casualty, product liability and other forms of insurance; however, such insurance may not be applicable or adequate to cover the costs associated with a judgment
against us with respect to these lawsuits, claims and proceedings. We do not believe that these lawsuits are material individually or in the aggregate. While we believe we have also established
adequate accruals for our expected future liability with respect to pending lawsuits, claims and proceedings, where the nature and extent of any such liability can be reasonably estimated based upon
then presently available information, there can be no assurance that the final resolution of any existing or future lawsuits, claims or proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Shares
purchased represent shares under 2007 Board authorized repurchase program (for up to $500 million of our common shares) and our Key Employee
Stock Investment Plan established in 1969 (there is no maximum repurchase limitation in this plan).



(2)

These
values reflect the sum of shares held in loan status of our Key Employee Stock Investment Plan. The $500 million repurchase program authorized
by the Board of Directors in 2007 does not limit the number of shares that may be purchased and was excluded from this column.

In
December 2007, the Board of Directors authorized us to acquire an additional $500 million of our common stock beginning in 2008. This authorization does not have an expiration
date. We acquired $128 million in 2008, $20 million in 2009 and $241 million in 2010, leaving $111 million available for purchase under this authorization at
December 31, 2010. In February 2011, the Board of Directors
approved a new share repurchase program and authorized the acquisition of up to $1 billion of Cummins common stock upon the completion of the $500 million program.

During
the fourth quarter of 2010, we repurchased 38,039 shares from employees in connection with the Key Employee Stock Investment Plan which allows certain employees, other than
officers, to purchase shares of common stock on an installment basis up to an established credit limit. Loans are issued for initial five-year terms at a fixed interest rate established at
the date of purchase and may be refinanced after its initial five-year period for an additional five-year period. Participants must hold shares for a minimum of six months from
date of purchase and after shares are sold must wait six months before another share purchase may be made. We hold participants' shares as security for the loans and would, in effect repurchase shares
if the participant defaulted in repayment of the loan. There is no maximum amount of shares that we may purchase under this plan.

For
the year ended December 31, 2010, consolidated net income included $32 million in Brazil tax recoveries ($21 million
after-tax) and $2 million in flood damage expenses. In the third quarter of 2010, it was determined that we overpaid a Brazilian revenue based tax during the period of
2004-2008. Consolidated net income includes a pre-tax recovery related to tax credits on imported products arising from this overpayment. For the year ended December 31,
2009, consolidated net income included $99 million in restructuring and other charges and a gain of $12 million related to flood damage recoveries. For the year ended December 31,
2008, consolidated net income included a $37 million restructuring charge, a $36 million decrease in cash surrender value in corporate owned life insurance and $5 million of
losses related to flood damages.

(2)

On
January 1, 2009, we adopted changes issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board to consolidation accounting and reporting. These changes,
among others, require that minority interests be renamed noncontrolling interests and a company present a consolidated net income measure that includes the amount attributable to such noncontrolling
interests for all periods presented.

All
per share amounts have been adjusted for the impact of a two-for-one stock split on April 9, 2007 and an additional

During
2006, we adopted the provisions of accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans under accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), which resulted in a $94 million non-cash charge to equity. In 2008, we recorded a $433 million non-cash charge to
equity to reflect losses associated with the effect of market conditions on our pension plans. In 2010, we recorded a $125 million non-cash credit to equity to reflect gains
associated with the effect of market conditions on our pension plans.

Statements

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

We are a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines, electric power
generation systems and engine-related component products, including filtration, exhaust aftertreatment, fuel systems, controls and air handling systems. We sell our products to original equipment
manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and other customers worldwide. We have long-standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve, including
PACCAR Inc., Chrysler Group, LLC, Daimler Trucks North America, MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG, Ford Motor Company, Komatsu, Volvo AB and Case New Holland. We serve our customers through a network
of more than 600 company-owned and independent distributor locations and approximately 6,000 dealer locations in more than 190 countries and territories.

Our
reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Power Generation, Components and Distribution. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and
markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers
in on-highway and various industrial markets. The engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well as various industrial applications including
construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military. The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines, generator sets and alternators.
The Components segment sells filtration products, exhaust aftertreatment systems, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships
engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMs throughout
the world.

Our
financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve, particularly the on-highway, construction and general industrial markets.
Demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rate levels and our customers' access to credit. Our sales
may also be impacted by OEM inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages. Economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products. As a
worldwide business, our operations are also affected by political, economic and regulatory matters, including environmental and
emission standards, in the countries we serve. At the same time, our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry
or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results.

In
2010, emerging markets recovered with stronger demand in China, India and Brazil, while we started to see modest but uneven signs of recovery in developed markets. As we expected,
after the strong demand in the second half of 2009, in advance of the 2010 United States (U.S.) emission change, demand for heavy-duty on-highway products in North America
decreased approximately 61 percent in 2010 versus 2009. In addition, medium-duty truck shipments in North America decreased 34 percent in 2010 versus 2009. Excluding North
American on-highway markets, overall order trends improved and were consistent with our expectations of organic revenue growth in 2010. In recognition of the global economic challenges, we
launched significant restructuring initiatives in late 2008 and 2009 that were designed to reduce structural and overhead costs across all of our businesses, improve operational performance,
strengthen our position in emerging markets and prepare to capitalize on the eventual recovery in North America and Europe. These initiatives helped to mitigate the adverse volume impacts that certain
markets experienced and they better position us for when a more robust economic recovery extends beyond the emerging markets. Despite the slow recovery in the U.S. markets and Europe, we were able to
operate much more efficiently and, as a result, recorded the most profitable results in our history in 2010.



The
following table contains sales and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) results by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Refer to the section
titled "Operating Segment Results" later in MD&A for a more detailed discussion of net sales and EBIT by operating segment including the reconciliation of segment EBIT to income before taxes.

Net
income attributable to Cummins Inc. for 2010 was $1,040 million, or $5.28 per diluted share, on sales of $13.2 billion, compared to 2009 net income attributable
to Cummins Inc. of $428 million, or $2.16 per diluted share, on sales of $10.8 billion. We recorded restructuring and other charges of $99 million ($65 million after
- -tax, or $0.33 per diluted share) in 2009. For a detailed discussion of restructuring see Note 22, "RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES," to our

Consolidated
Financial Statements.

The increase in income was driven by higher volumes in emerging markets, price improvements, increased equity income, decreased warranty expenses and
restructuring charges incurred in 2009 that were not repeated in 2010. These were partially offset by higher income tax expense, selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development
and engineering expenses in 2010 as compared to 2009.

In
2010, we recorded a pre-tax recovery of $32 million ($21 million after -tax, or $0.11 per diluted share) related to the overpayment of revenue
based taxes on imported products in Brazil from 2004-2008. The tax recovery was recorded in cost of sales in our non segment business results as it was not considered by management in its
evaluation of operating results for the year.

We
generated $1,006 million of operating cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, compared to $1,137 million for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2009. Refer to the section titled "Operating Activities" later in the MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the
acquisition of up to $500 million of our common stock. In February 2009, we temporarily suspended our stock repurchase program to conserve cash through the U.S. recession. We resumed stock
repurchases under our Board authorization in the fourth quarter of 2009 and we have repurchased $241 million of common stock during 2010. In February 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the
acquisition of up to $1 billion of Cummins common stock. In July 2010, our Board authorized a dividend increase of 50 percent to $0.2625 effective in the third quarter. Our debt to
capital ratio (total capital defined as debt plus equity) at December 31, 2010, was 14.4 percent, compared to 14.9 percent at December 31, 2009. We currently have a Baa2
credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody's Investors Services, a BBB+ credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard and Poor's and a BBB+ credit rating and a positive outlook from Fitch. In
addition to the $1.362 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand, we have sufficient access to our revolver and accounts receivable program to meet currently anticipated growth and
funding needs.



Our
global pension plans, including our unfunded non-qualified plans, were 96 percent funded at year-end 2010. The U.S. qualified plan, which is
approximately 62 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 99 percent funded, and the international plans were 107 percent funded. Asset returns in 2010 for the U.S.
qualified plan were 15.2 percent while the year-end 2010 discount rate was 5.40%, down 0.20 percentage points from the 2009 discount rate of 5.60%. We expect to contribute
$130 million of cash to our global pension plans in 2011. We do not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for our U.S. plans in 2010. We expect pension and other
postretirement benefit expense in 2011 to decrease by approximately $5 million pre-tax, or $0.02 per diluted share, when compared to 2010. Refer to application of critical
accounting estimates within MD&A and Note 11, "PENSION AND OTHER POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS," to the

Consolidated Financial Statements

, for
additional information concerning our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.

2011 OUTLOOK

Near-Term:

In 2010, economies in emerging markets, including China, India and Brazil, recovered and we started to see signs of economic recovery
in developed markets. We expect the following positive trends in 2011:

•

Markets for the majority of our products in China, India and Brazil should continue to grow, but at a slower pace than
experienced in 2010 and we are expanding our capacity in China and India to meet the expected demand.

•

Our markets in North America are expected to improve, especially with the anticipated strong recovery of
on-highway truck markets and a significant improvement in our power generation markets.

•

Other markets for our products will continue to expand, including Mexico, the Middle East and
Europe.

•

We expect most of our other markets to continue to grow.

We
expect the following challenges to our business that will put pressure on earnings in 2011:

•

A higher mix of EPA 2010 compliant engines will likely increase our product warranty.

•

We will increase our investment in new product development.

•

Our joint ventures will likely experience slower growth as we invest in capacity.

•

Increasing commodity costs could continue to put downward pressure on earnings.

Long-Term:

We see improvements in most of our current markets and we are confident that opportunities for long-term profitable growth
will continue in the future.

Net Sales

Sales increased in all segments primarily due to increased demand from the recovery of emerging markets and improvement in developed
markets. The primary drivers for the increase in sales were:

•

Engine segment sales increased by 23 percent due to increased demand in most lines of business, led by increased
demand in international industrial sales, stationary power engine sales, North American light-duty automotive sales and international medium-duty truck sales.



•

Power Generation segment sales increased by 21 percent due to increased sales in most lines of business led by
commercial products.

•

Components segment sales increased by 29 percent due to increased demand in all lines of business led by emission
solutions, turbo technologies and filtration businesses.

•

Distribution segment sales increased by 30 percent primarily due to the acquisition of the majority interest in an
equity investee and increased sales in all geographic regions.

A
more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section.

Sales
to international markets were 64 percent of total net sales in 2010, compared with 52 percent of total net sales in 2009 and 59 percent of total net sales in
2008.

warranty expense, increased pricing and favorable material costs.

The
warranty provision on sales issued in 2010 as a percentage of sales was 3.0 percent compared to 3.3 percent in 2009. The decrease as a percentage of sales was primarily
due to engine mix. A more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section.

In
the third quarter of 2010, it was determined that we overpaid a Brazilian revenue based tax on imported products during the period 2004-2008. Our results include a
pre-tax recovery of $32 million in cost of sales ($21 million after-tax) related to tax credits arising from an overpayment. This recovery has been excluded from
segment results as it was not considered by management in its evaluation of operating results for the year.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher volumes in support of the business and an increase of
$151 million in compensation and related expenses. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. Variable compensation related to 2010
performance increased $93 million over variable compensation related to 2009 performance. Salaries and fringe benefits increased due to severance actions taken throughout 2009 that were
partially offset by increased employment in 2010. Overall, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased slightly to 11.2 percent in 2010 from
11.5 percent in 2009.



Research, Development and Engineering Expenses

Research, development and engineering expenses increased primarily due to an increase of $35 million in compensation and related
expenses and a decrease of $24 million in reimbursements. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. Variable compensation related to 2010
performance increased $20 million over variable compensation related to 2009 performance. Overall, research, development and engineering expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased slightly
to 3.1 percent in 2010 from 3.4 percent in 2009. Research activities continue to focus on development of new products to meet future emission standards around the world and improvements
in fuel economy performance.

(2)

The
foreign currency exchange losses in 2009 were due to unfavorable currency fluctuations; primarily in the British Pound and Brazilian Real.

Income Tax Expense

Our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on
foreign earnings and research tax credits. Our effective tax rate for 2010 was 29.5 percent compared to 24.4 percent for 2009. Our 2010 income tax provision also includes a
$17 million (1.1 percent) reduction in the fourth quarter related to the legislative reinstatement of the U.S. research tax credit. During 2010, we also released $3 million
(0.2 percent) of deferred U.S. tax liabilities on foreign earnings now considered to be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. Our 2009 income tax provision also includes a
$29 million (4.5 percent) reduction in the fourth quarter related to adjustments to deferred tax accounts. In 2009, we released $19 million of deferred tax liabilities on foreign
earnings now considered to be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. and recorded a deferred tax asset of $10 million related to prior period matters.

We
expect our 2011 effective tax rate to be 30 percent excluding any discrete items that may arise.

Noncontrolling Interests

Noncontrolling interests eliminate the income or loss attributable to non-Cummins ownership interests in our consolidated
entities. Noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries increased primarily due to higher income of $18 million at Cummins India Ltd., a publicly traded company on
various exchanges in India and a $15 million increase in income from Wuxi Cummins Turbo Technologies Co. Ltd., reflecting the economic recovery in emerging markets.



Net Income Attributable to Cummins Inc. and Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to Cummins Inc.

Net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to Cummins Inc. increased primarily due to higher volumes in emerging
markets and certain developed countries, significantly improved gross margins, increased equity income and restructuring charges incurred in 2009 that were not repeated in 2010. These were partially
offset by higher income tax expense, selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses. Diluted earnings per share also benefited $0.06 from lower shares
primarily due to the stock repurchase program.

2009 vs. 2008

Net Sales

Sales decreased in all segments primarily due to lower demand as a result of the global economic downturn. The primary drivers
were:

•

Engine segment sales declined by 27 percent primarily due to industrial sales decreasing by 40 percent and
on-highway sales decreasing by 16 percent.

•

Power Generation segment sales declined by 31 percent due to declines in all lines of business led by the
commercial products line of business.

•

Components segment sales declined by 25 percent due to declines in all lines of business led by the filtration and
turbo technologies businesses.

•

Distribution segment sales declined by 18 percent.

Gross
margin decreased by $771 million, and as a percentage of sales decreased by 0.4 percentage points. The decrease was led by lower volumes which were partially offset
by increased engine purchases ahead of the January 1, 2010, emission standards change, improved pricing and decreased production costs. The overall decrease in volumes was due to lower sales
resulting from the global economic downturn. Our warranty provision on sales in 2009 was 3.3 percent compared to 2.9 percent in 2008. Our 2008 warranty expense included
$117 million recorded in the fourth quarter associated with increases in the estimated warranty liability primarily for certain mid-range engine products launched in 2007. The
accrual rates in 2009 for these related engine products were higher than those recorded in 2008 before this change in estimate. As such, our warranty as a percentage of sales for



these
engine families is higher on products sold in 2009 than it was in 2008. Overall, our relative product mix also impacted the rate as a percentage of sales when comparing these two periods.

A
more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease of $74 million in discretionary spending, in
order to conserve cash, and a decrease of $71 million in compensation and related expenses. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation.
Salaries and fringe benefits decreased due to severance actions taken throughout 2009. Overall, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 11.5 percent
in 2009 from 10.1 percent in 2008, primarily due to the 25 percent decrease in net sales.

Research, Development and Engineering Expenses

Research, development and engineering expenses decreased primarily due to a lower number of engineering projects to conserve cash while
focusing on the development of critical technologies, new products and increased reimbursements from third parties for engineering projects. Overall, research, development and engineering expenses as
a percentage of sales increased to 3.4 percent in 2009 from 2.9 percent in 2008, primarily due to the 25 percent decrease in net sales.

Equity, Royalty and Interest Income from Investees

(2)

The
change in the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance in 2008 was due to market deterioration, which included the write down of certain
investments to zero.

Income Tax Expense

Our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on
foreign earnings and research tax credits. Our effective tax rate for



was 24.4 percent compared to 30.6 percent for 2008. The decrease is due to tax on foreign earnings, which are subject to lower tax rates, and an increase in research tax credits.
Our 2009 income tax provision also includes a $29 million (4.5 percent) reduction in the fourth quarter related to adjustments to deferred tax accounts. In 2009, we released
$19 million (3.0 percent) of deferred tax liabilities on foreign earnings, now considered to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. and recorded a deferred tax asset of
$10 million (1.5 percent) related to prior period matters.

Noncontrolling Interests

Noncontrolling interests eliminate the income or loss attributable to non-Cummins ownership interests in our consolidated
entities. Noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries decreased primarily due to lower income of $8 million at Cummins India Limited, a publicly traded company at various
exchanges in India, as a result of the decline in demand due to the global economic downturn. There were no other individual fluctuations in the subsidiaries that were significant.

Net Income Attributable to Cummins Inc. and Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to Cummins Inc.

Net income attributable to Cummins Inc. and diluted earnings per share attributable to Cummins Inc. decreased primarily
due to significantly lower volumes, restructuring and other charges and decreased equity income partially offset by a lower effective tax rate.

RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES

2009 Restructuring Actions

In 2009, we executed restructuring actions in response to a reduction in orders in most of our U.S. and foreign markets due to the
deterioration in the global economy. We reduced our global workforce by approximately 1,000 professional employees. In addition, we took numerous employee actions at many of our manufacturing
locations, including approximately 3,200 hourly employees, significant downsizing at numerous facilities and complete closure of several facilities and branch distributor locations. Employee
termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under
existing severance plans, union contracts or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan. Estimates of restructuring costs were made based on information available at
the time charges were recorded. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved, actual amounts paid for such activities may differ from amounts initially recorded.

In
response to closures and downsizing noted above, we incurred $2 million of restructuring expenses for lease terminations and $5 million of restructuring expenses for
asset impairments. During 2009, we recorded a total pre-tax restructuring charge of $85 million, comprising $90 million of charges related to 2009 actions net of the
$3 million favorable change in estimate related to 2008 actions and the $2 million favorable change in estimate related to earlier 2009 actions, in "Restructuring and other charges" in

2008 Restructuring Actions

We executed restructuring actions primarily in the form of voluntary and involuntary separation programs in the fourth quarter of 2008.
These actions were in response to the continued deterioration in our U.S. businesses and most key markets around the world in the second half of 2008, as well as a



reduction
in orders in most U.S. and global markets for 2009. We reduced our worldwide professional workforce by approximately 650 employees, or 4.5 percent. We offered a voluntary retirement
package to certain active professional employees in the U.S. based on a clearly defined set of criteria. We also took voluntary and involuntary actions which included approximately 800 hourly
employees, the majority of which received severance benefits. The compensation packages contained salary and continuation of benefits, including health care, life insurance and outplacement services.
The voluntary retirement package was accepted by approximately 150 employees. The remaining professional reductions of 500 employees were involuntary. The expenses recorded during the year ended
December 31, 2008, included severance costs related to both voluntary and involuntary terminations. During 2008, we incurred a pre-tax charge related to the professional and hourly
restructuring initiatives of approximately $37 million.

Employee
termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated, benefits
to be paid under existing severance plans or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan. At December 31, 2008, of the approximately 1,450 employees affected by
this plan, 1,250 had been terminated. All terminations were substantially complete as of December 31, 2009.

We
do not include restructuring charges in the segment results. The pre-tax impact of allocating restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2008, would have

OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS

Our reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Power Generation, Components, and Distribution. This reporting
structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine
segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various industrial markets. The engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and RVs, as well as various
industrial applications including construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military. The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells
engines, generator sets and alternators. The Components segment includes sales of filtration products, exhaust and aftertreatment systems, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Distribution segment
includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets, and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and
maintaining relationships with various OEMs.

We
use segment EBIT (defined as earnings before interest expense, taxes and noncontrolling interests) as a primary basis for the chief operating decision-maker to evaluate the
performance of each of our operating segments. Segment amounts exclude certain expenses not specifically identifiable to segments.

The
accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those applied in our

Consolidated Financial Statements

. We prepared the
financial results of our operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We
have allocated certain common costs and expenses, primarily corporate functions, among segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). These include certain costs and expenses of shared services, such as information technology, human resources, legal and finance.
We also do not allocate debt-related items, actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, changes in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance, restructuring and
other charges, flood damage gains or losses, or income taxes to individual segments. In 2010, non-segment items also included a Brazil revenue tax recovery that was not allocated to the
businesses as it was not considered by management in its evaluation of operating results for the year. Segment EBIT may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.



Following
is a discussion of operating results for each of our business segments.

2010 vs. 2009

Sales

Engine segment sales increased versus 2009, due to improved sales in most markets, especially the industrial, stationary power,
light-duty automotive and medium-duty truck markets, which were partially offset by decreases in the North American heavy-duty truck market. The following are the
primary drivers by market.

•

Industrial market sales increased primarily due to a 154 percent improvement in international construction engine
shipments driven by the economic recovery and infrastructure investment in emerging markets and a 123 percent improvement in units sold in the international mining markets due to increased coal
and commodity demands.

•

Stationary power engine sales increased primarily due to higher demand in power generation markets, particularly for
high-horse power engines.

•

Light-duty automotive sales increased significantly due to a 77 percent improvement in units sold to
Chrysler as the result of shut-downs in 2009 as part of its reorganization efforts.

•

Medium-duty truck engine sales increased due to a 78 percent increase in international units sold,
primarily due to higher demand in the Brazilian truck market driven by a growing economy and government incentives.

These
increases were partially offset by a decline in heavy-duty truck engine sales. Consistent with prior emission standards changes, North American (includes the U.S and
Canada and excludes Mexico) unit sales declined 61 percent due to higher engine purchases by OEMs in late 2009, ahead of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA)'s 2010 emission
standards change, as part of the OEM's transition plan.

Total
on-highway-related sales for 2010 were 50 percent of total engine segment sales, compared to 61 percent in 2009.

Segment EBIT

Engine segment EBIT increased significantly versus 2009, primarily due to higher gross margin and equity, royalty and interest income
from investees which were partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses. Changes in Engine segment EBIT and EBIT as a
percentage of sales were as follows:

The
increase in gross margin versus 2009, was primarily due to higher volumes, improved price realization, decreased warranty expense and cost structure improvements from actions taken
in late 2008 and early 2009, partially offset by an unfavorable mix. Equity, royalty and interest income from investees increased in most unconsolidated joint ventures. The increase was led by higher
demand in emerging markets, especially at DCEC and Komatsu-Cummins Engine Company (KCEC). The increase



in
selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher variable compensation which resulted from the segment's strong performance.

2009 vs. 2008

Sales

Engine segment sales experienced deterioration across all major markets, versus 2008, as a result of the global economic downturn. The
following are the primary drivers by market.

•

Industrial market sales decreased due to deterioration in units sold in the construction, marine and mining markets by
63 percent, 45 percent and 50 percent, respectively.

•

Stationary power market sales declined due to decreased sales to the Power Generation segment as it used existing
inventory to meet declining customer demand.

•

Medium-duty truck engine sales decreased significantly due to a 35 percent decline in international
truck units sold as a result of the global economic downturn. The U.S. market was impacted by the economic downturn; however, this was partially offset by increased sales ahead of the
January 1, 2010, emission standards change and improving market share.

•

Heavy-duty truck engine sales declined as international units sold were down 64 percent. We experienced
a decline in Mexican heavy-duty sales due to an increase in heavy-duty truck sales in the first six months of 2008 resulting from the increased activity ahead of Mexico's
July 1, 2008, new emission requirements, appreciation of the U.S. dollar and an influx of used trucks into the market from the U.S. and Canada permitted under a new law. Although U.S. truck
fleets experienced financial challenges due to a lack of freight and limited access to credit, our U.S. heavy-duty engine sales ended the year flat as a result of increased sales in the

The
decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower engine volumes in most markets as a result of the global economic downturn, which was partially offset by increased sales in the
U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2009 ahead of the January 1, 2010, emission standards change, price improvements and by cost reduction activities at our manufacturing plants. Equity, royalty and
interest income from investees decreased due to significantly lower demand at DCEC, KCEC and Cummins MerCruiser



Diesel
Marine LLC. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses was primarily due to lower discretionary spending, higher
recovery of engineering expenses from third parties and decreased payroll costs as the result of restructuring actions.

2010 vs. 2009

Sales

Power Generation segment sales improved in most businesses, versus 2009, primarily due to increased demand. The following are the
primary drivers by business.

•

Commercial products sales increased due to higher demand in the U.K., Latin America, India, and East Asia which was
partially offset by decreased demand in North America.

•

Consumer sales increased primarily due to signs of recovery in the North American RV market.

•

Commercial projects sales increased due to higher demand in the South Pacific and Africa, partially offset by reduced
demand in the Middle East.



•

Generator technologies sales increased due to higher demand in East Asia, the U.K. and India, partially offset by a
decline in demand in North America, East Europe and the Middle East.

Segment EBIT

Power Generation segment EBIT increased versus 2009, primarily due to higher gross margins and equity, royalty and interest income from
investees which were partially offset by increased selling general and administrative expenses. Changes in Power Generation segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows:

The
increase in gross margin was due to higher volumes, partially offset by increased warranty expenses and increased variable compensation. The increase in selling general and
administrative expenses was primarily due to higher variable compensation expense which resulted from the strong improvement over 2009. Equity, royalty and interest income from investees increased due
to higher demand, especially at Cummins Olayan Energy and CCEC.

2009 vs. 2008

Sales

Power Generation segment sales decreased in most businesses, versus 2008, as the result of the global economic downturn. The following
are the primary drivers by business.

•

Commercial products sales decreased due to lower demand across most regions, especially in North America, the U.K., the
Middle East, Latin America and India.

•

Generator technologies sales decreased due to lower OEM demand in Western Europe, North America and India.

•

Commercial projects sales decreased due to lower demand in most regions, especially in North America, Western Europe and
the U.K.

The
decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower volumes, unfavorable sales mix and increased material and commodity costs which were partially offset by improved pricing and
favorable foreign currency translation. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses was primarily due to favorable foreign currency
translation, lower variable compensation costs, implementation of severance programs and decreased discretionary spending.

Beginning
January 1, 2009, we reorganized the reporting structure of two businesses and moved a portion of our filtration business into the emission
solutions business. For the year ended 2009, the sales for the portion of the business included in emission solutions were $86 million. Sales for the portion of the business included in
filtration for the year ended 2008 was $136 million. The 2008 balances were not reclassified.

2010 vs. 2009

Sales

Components segment sales increased in all businesses versus 2009. The following are the primary regional drivers by business.

•

Emission solutions business sales increased due to higher technology content and increased sales of North American EPA
2010 aftertreatment systems and higher European demand for aftertreatment systems for the first fit market, which was partially offset by decreased sales of our EPA 2007 aftertreatment systems.

•

Turbo technologies business sales increased due to improved original equipment demand in Europe and China and significant
global aftermarket recovery.

•

Filtration business sales increased in all regions primarily due to global aftermarket recovery and improved global
original equipment sales.

•

Fuel systems business sales increased primarily due to improved OEM first fit sales in China and the aftermarket recovery
in North America, which was partially offset by decreased first fit sales in North America.

Segment EBIT

Components segment EBIT almost tripled versus 2009, primarily due to the improved gross margin which was partially offset by increased
selling, general and administrative expenses and research,



development
and engineering expenses. Changes in Components segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows:

The
increase in gross margin was due to higher volumes for all businesses, increased aftertreatment content on 2010 North American truck engines and efficiencies gained from
restructuring actions partially offset by higher commodity costs and warranty expenses. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses
were primarily due to increased variable compensation which resulted from the segment's strong performance; other people costs and new product development program spending.

2009 vs. 2008

Sales

Components segment sales decreased in all businesses versus 2008, as the result of the global economic downturn. The following are the
primary drivers by business.

•

Filtration business sales decreased significantly due to falling global aftermarket and OEM demand, especially in North
America and Europe, and the transfer of a portion of the business to emission solutions in 2009.

•

Turbo technologies business sales decreased significantly due to falling OEM demand in Europe and North America.

•

Fuel systems business sales decreased primarily due to falling OEM demand in North America and Europe.

•

Emission solutions business sales decreased due to falling OEM demand across Europe and North America. These decreases
were partially offset by the transfer of a portion of the filtration business into emission solutions in 2009.



Segment EBIT

Components segment EBIT decreased versus 2008, primarily due to a lower gross margin which was partially offset by decreased selling,
general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses. Changes in Components segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows:

The
acquisitions represent the purchase of the majority interest in Cummins Western Canada (CWC), an equity investee, in the first quarter of 2010 and the
purchase of a majority interest in a previously independent North American distributorship, as explained in Note 21, "ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES," to the

Consolidated
Financial Statements

. The acquisition of CWC and the majority interest in the distributorship increased sales by $286 million and EBIT by $30 million in 2010. The
2009 data does not exclude the acquisition which occurred in 2009.

This
amount includes $13 million of equity earnings which would have been our share of CWC's income for 2010 if we had not consolidated them.

Sales

Distribution segment sales, excluding the acquisitions, increased versus 2009, due to increased parts and service revenues, increased
engine sales driven by sales in Europe and the South Pacific and favorable foreign currency impacts in most regions.

Segment EBIT

Distribution segment EBIT increased versus 2009, primarily due to increased gross margin and a one-time gain from an

unallocated corporate expenses include $32 million in Brazil tax recoveries ($21 million after-tax) and $2 million in flood damage expenses. The Brazil tax recovery
has been excluded from segment results as it was not considered by management in its evaluation of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010. For the year ended December 31,
2009, unallocated corporate expenses included $99 million in restructuring and other charges and a gain of $12 million related to flood damage recoveries. For the year ended
December 31, 2008, unallocated corporate expenses included $37 million of restructuring charges, a $36 million decrease in cash surrender value in corporate owned life insurance
and $5 million of losses related to flood damage recoveries.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Management's Assessment of Liquidity

Our financial condition and liquidity remain strong. Our solid balance sheet and credit ratings enable us to have ready access to
credit as we terminated our three year credit facility a year early and entered into a new four year credit facility during 2010.

We
assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Cash provided by operations is our principal source
of liquidity. As of December 31, 2010, other sources of liquidity include:

•

Cash and cash equivalents of $1,023 million, of which approximately 33 percent is located in the U.S. and
67 percent is located in the United Kingdom (U.K.), China, Singapore, Brazil and India,

•

Marketable securities of $339 million, which are located primarily in India and Brazil and the majority of which
could be liquidated into cash within a few days,

•

Revolving credit facility with $1.21 billion available, net of outstanding letters of credit,

•

International and other domestic credit facilities with $278 million available and



•

Accounts receivable sales program with $122 million available, based on eligible receivables.

We
believe our liquidity provides us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital, capital expenditures, projected pension obligations, dividend payments, common stock
repurchases and debt service obligations.

On
July 16, 2010, we entered into a new four year revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders which provides us with a $1.24 billion unsecured revolving credit
facility, the proceeds of which are to be used for the general corporate purposes of Cummins. See Note 9, "DEBT" to the

Consolidated Financial
Statements

for further information. The credit agreement includes two financial covenants: a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. At December 31, 2010, we were
in compliance with both financial covenants.

The
required leverage ratio, which measures the sum of total debt plus securitization financing to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)
for the four fiscal quarters should not exceed 3.0 to 1. At December 31, 2010, our leverage using this measure was 0.46 to 1. The required interest coverage ratio, which is consolidated EBITDA
minus capital expenditures to consolidated interest expense, in each case for the four consecutive fiscal quarters, should not be less than 1.50 to 1. At December 31, 2010, our interest
coverage ratio using this measure was 36.68 to 1.

We
continuously monitor our pension assets and believe that we have limited exposure to the European debt crisis. No sovereign debt instruments of crisis countries are held in the
trusts, while any equities held are with large, well-diversified multinational firms or are de minimus amounts in large index funds. In addition, we have rebalanced our asset portfolio's
in the U.S. and U.K. with equities representing a smaller segment of the total portfolios. Our pension plans have not experienced any significant impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to
the volatility in the credit markets.

A
significant portion of our cash flows is generated outside the U.S. More than half of our cash and cash equivalents and most of our marketable securities at December 31, 2010,
are denominated in foreign currencies. We manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost
effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The repatriation of cash balances from certain subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences; however, those balances are generally available,
without legal restrictions, to fund ordinary business operations at the local level. We have and will continue to transfer cash from these subsidiaries to us and to other international subsidiaries
when it is cost effective to do so.

The
maturity schedule of our existing long-term debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term. Required annual principal payments range from
$8 million to $116 million over each of the next five years.

Working Capital Summary

We fund our working capital with cash from operations and short-term borrowings when necessary. Various assets and
liabilities, including short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month



depending
on short-term liquidity needs. As a result, working capital is a prime focus of management attention.

2010 vs. 2009

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased versus 2009, primarily due to significantly higher inventory levels to meet
anticipated demand, increased equity in income of investees net of dividends and higher pension contributions made in the year. This was partially offset by significantly higher consolidated net
income and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses as the result of increased purchasing to support higher sales volumes.

Pensions

The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets and
market interest rate levels. We made $221 million of pension contributions in 2010 (including voluntary contributions of $108 million). These contributions include payments from our
funds either to increase pension plan assets or to make direct payments to plan participants. We expect to contribute $130 million of cash to our global pension plans in 2011.

2009 vs. 2008

Net cash provided by operating activities increased versus 2008, primarily due to favorable working capital fluctuations, principally
inventories, as a result of management's response to the challenging global economy and increased dividends from our equity investees which were partially offset by



decreased
income as the result of declining sales. Management's priorities included reducing inventory, aligning our cost and capacity with the real demand for our products and managing the business
to generate positive cash flows by improving our working capital.

2010 vs. 2009

Net cash used in investing activities increased versus 2009, primarily due to acquisitions (See Note 21, "ACQUISITIONS" to our

Consolidated Financial
Statements

), higher capital expenditures and increased investments in marketable securities, which were partially offset by
higher proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment.

Capital
expenditures were $364 million compared to $310 million in the comparable period in 2009. We continue to invest in the development of new products and we plan to
spend approximately $600 million to $650 million in 2011 as we continue with product launches, facility improvements and prepare for future on-highway emission standards and
product launches.

2009 vs. 2008

Net cash used in investing activities decreased versus 2008, primarily due to decreased capital expenditures and lower investments in
the acquisition of businesses which were partially offset by increased net cash paid for investments in marketable securities and lower cash proceeds from the sale of a business. These decreases
primarily occurred as a result of management's decision to conserve cash and maintain liquidity during the recession.

Capital
expenditures decreased as management tightened capital spending substantially across all business by limiting expenditures to critical projects and investments in development of
new products.

2010 vs. 2009

Net cash used in financing activities increased versus 2009, primarily due to increased repurchases of common stock, which was
partially offset by higher proceeds from borrowings primarily related to the acquisition of CWC and borrowings in Brazil.

Our
total debt was $843 million as of December 31, 2010, compared with $703 million as of December 31, 2009. Total debt as a percent of our total capital,
including total long-term debt, was 14.4 percent at December 31, 2010, compared with 14.9 percent at December 31, 2009. The increase in total debt was
principally due to acquisitions and borrowings in Brazil which were subsequently invested in marketable securities.

2009 vs. 2008

Net cash used in financing activities declined versus 2008, primarily due to the decrease in repurchases of common stock and lower
payments on borrowings, which was partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from borrowings and higher dividend payments.

Our
total debt was $703 million as of December 31, 2009, compared with $698 million at December 31, 2008. Total debt as a percent of our total capital,
including total long-term debt, was 14.9 percent at December 31, 2009, compared to 16.7 percent at December 31, 2008.

Repurchase of Common Stock

In December 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the acquisition of up to $500 million of Cummins common stock. We began
making purchases under the plan in March 2008 and purchased $128 million of stock during 2008 at an average cost of $55.49 per share.

In
February 2009, we temporarily suspended our stock repurchase program to conserve cash. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we lifted the suspension and purchased $20 million of
common stock at an average cost of $46.52 per common share.



In
2010, we purchased $241 million of common stock through the following quarterly purchases:

We expect to fund dividend payments with cash from operations.

Credit Ratings

A number of our contractual obligations and financing agreements, such as our revolving credit facility, have restrictive covenants
and/or pricing modifications that may be triggered in the event of downward revisions to our corporate credit rating. There were no downgrades of our credit ratings in 2010 that have impacted these
covenants or pricing modifications.

In
January 2011, Fitch affirmed our ratings and upgraded our outlook to positive. In September 2010, Standard and Poor's raised our senior unsecured debt ratings to BBB+ and changed our
outlook to stable. In July 2010, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. raised our senior unsecured debt ratings to Baa2.



Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, are subject to change and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. In addition, we
undertake no obligation to update disclosures concerning our credit ratings, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Our ratings and outlook from each of the credit rating

OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Financing Arrangements for Affiliated Parties

In accordance with the provisions of various joint venture agreements, we may purchase and/or sell products and components from/to the
joint ventures and the joint ventures may sell products and components to unrelated parties. The transfer price of products purchased from the joint ventures may differ from normal selling prices.
Certain joint venture agreements transfer product to us at cost, some transfer product to us on a cost-plus basis and other agreements provide for the transfer of products at market value.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 1, "SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES," of our

Consolidated Financial
Statements

which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives.

Our

Consolidated Financial Statements

are prepared in accordance with GAAP which often requires management to make judgments, estimates
and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements. Management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical
experience, changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In any given reporting period, our actual results may differ from the
estimates and assumptions used in preparing our

Consolidated Financial Statements.

Critical
accounting estimates are defined as follows: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made;
different estimates reasonably could have been used; or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial
condition or results of operations. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies, related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with
the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs, recoverability of investment
related to new products, accounting for income taxes, pension benefits and annual assessment of recoverability of goodwill.

Warranty Programs

We estimate and record a liability for base warranty programs at the time our products are sold. Our estimates are based on historical
experience and reflect management's best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ. As a result of the
uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall



programs,
the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action, which generally occurs when it is announced. Our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure
rates, repair costs and the point of failure within the product life cycle. Future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to
our liability. New product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. Product specific experience is typically available four or
five quarters after product launch, with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch. We generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a preceding product's
warranty history and a multiplicative factor based upon preceding similar product experience and new product assessment until sufficient new product data is available for warranty estimation. We then
use a blend of actual new product experience and preceding product historical experience for several subsequent quarters, and new product specific experience thereafter. Note 10, "PRODUCT
WARRANTY LIABILITY," to our

Consolidated Financial Statements

contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2010 and 2009
including adjustments to pre-existing warranties.

Recoverability of Investment Related to New Products

At December 31, 2010, we have capitalized $218 million associated with the future launch of our light-duty
diesel engine product. Development of this product began in 2006. Market uncertainty related to the global recession that began in 2008 resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle
programs. At December 31, 2009, we reviewed our investment of $216 million for possible impairment. We used projections to assess whether future cash flows on an undiscounted basis
related to the assets are likely to exceed the related carrying amount to determine if a write-down is appropriate. These projections required estimates about product volume and the size
of the market for vehicles that are not yet developed. We used input from our customers in developing alternative cash flow scenarios. Our analysis indicated that the assets were recoverable.
Customers that are expected to purchase sufficient quantities to recover our investment in the light-duty diesel engine products remained active with the development of this product
through 2010 and there were no significant changes to the assumptions used in 2009. If customer expectations or projected volumes deteriorate and we do not identify alternative customers and/or
product applications, we could be required to write-down these assets to net realizable value.

Accounting for Income Taxes

We determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future tax benefits
of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future
profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2010, we recorded net deferred tax assets of
$511 million. These assets included $139 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance of $50 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to
the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized. In the event our operating performance deteriorates, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will
be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex
issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax
positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available. A more complete description
of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and



credit
carryforwards is disclosed in Note 6, "INCOME TAXES," to our

Consolidated Financial Statements

.

Pension Benefits

We sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the U.S. and the U.K. and to a lesser degree in various other countries. In the U.S.
and the U.K. we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded. We account for our pension programs in accordance with employers' accounting for defined benefit pension and other
postretirement plans under GAAP. GAAP requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis. As a result, our pension benefit programs are based on a number
of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at December 31. These
assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities, assumed rates of return on plan assets, future compensation increases, employee turnover rates, actuarial assumptions relating to
retirement age, mortality rates and participant withdrawals. The actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions, participant life span
and withdrawal rates. These differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our

Consolidated Financial
Statements

in the future.

The
expected long-term return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension expense. We considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return
on plan assets. The long-term rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a 5-year
average market value of return. Projected returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment
management. As of December 31, 2010, based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our U.S. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the
20-year projection period equal to or in excess of 7.5 percent approximately 40 percent of the time while returns of 8.4 percent or greater are anticipated
25 percent of the time. We expect additional positive returns from active investment management. The 2010 one year return exceeded 15 percent, combined with the very favorable returns in
2009 has eliminated the significant deterioration in pension assets experienced in 2008 as a result of the credit crisis and related market recession. Based on the historical returns and
forward-looking return expectations, we believe an investment return assumption of 8.0 percent per year in 2011 for U.S. pension assets is reasonable. The methodology used to determine the rate
of return on pension plan assets in the U.K. was based on establishing an equity-risk premium over current long-term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations. As
of December 31, 2010, based upon our target asset allocations, it is anticipated that our U.K. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20-year projection
period equal to or in excess of 6.5 percent approximately 50 percent of the time while returns of 9.3 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time. We expect
additional positive returns from active investment management. The one year return for our UK plan was 13 percent for 2010 and similar to our US plan, the 2008 market related deterioration in
our plan assets has been eliminated. Our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a long-term outlook. Therefore, the risk and return balance
of our asset portfolio should reflect a long-term horizon. Based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations, we believe an investment return



assumption
of 7.0 percent in 2011 for U.K. pension assets is reasonable. Our pension plan asset allocation at December 31, 2010 and 2009 and target allocation for 2011 are as follows:

The
differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected long-term return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense
over five years. The table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension expense for the period 2008-2010 and our expected rate for 2011.

A
lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension expense and reduce profitability.

The
difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and, under certain circumstances such as when
the difference exceeds 10 percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation (PBO), amortized over future years of service. This is also true of changes to actuarial
assumptions. As of December 31, 2010, we had net pension actuarial losses of $692 million and $227 million for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively. Under
GAAP, the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Decreases in actuarial losses increased our shareholders' equity by $125 million
(after-tax) in 2010. The decreases resulted from improved plan asset performance in 2010. As these amounts exceed 10 percent of our PBO, the excess is amortized over the average
remaining service lives of participating employees.

The
table below sets forth the net periodic pension expense for the period 2008 through 2010 and our expected expense for 2011.

Net Periodic

Pension Expense

In millions





Pension expense

$

We
expect 2011 pension expense to be slightly under 2010, due to strong returns and higher assets, partially offset by a decrease in the discount rate. The decrease in periodic pension
expense in 2010, was due to improved returns on assets as the capital markets began to recover, strong contributions in 2009 and the absence of any curtailment charges. The increase in periodic
pension expense in 2009 was due to lower than historical returns on assets driven by the global economic recession. Another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension expense
is the discount rate. The



weighted
average discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension expense are set forth in the table below.

Changes
in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension expense calculation.

The
discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. The guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in GAAP
which suggests the use of a high-quality corporate bond rate. We used bond information provided by Moody's, Standard & Poors, Fitch and Dominion Bond Rating. All bonds used to
develop our hypothetical portfolio in the U.S. and U.K. were high-quality, non-callable bonds (Aa or better) as of December 31, 2010. The average yield of this
hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to value the obligations of the plans subject to GAAP for pensions and other postretirement benefits.

Our
model called for 80 years of benefit payments for the U.S. plans and 60 years of payments for the U.K. For both countries, our model matches the present value of the
plan's projected benefit payments to the market value of the theoretical settlement bond portfolio. A single equivalent discount rate is determined to align the present value of the required cash flow
with the value of the bond portfolio. The resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plan's distinct liability characteristics.

The
table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2011 net periodic pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan
assets.

The
above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. A higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension expense. A
lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension expense. It should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions
simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear.

Annual Assessment for Recoverability of Goodwill

Under GAAP for goodwill and other intangible assets, the carrying value of goodwill must be tested for impairment on an annual basis
and between annual tests in certain circumstances where impairment may be indicated. The fair value of each reporting unit was estimated by discounting the future cash flows less requirements for
working capital and fixed asset additions. In accordance with GAAP, our reporting units are generally defined as one level below an operating segment. However, there were two situations where we have
aggregated two or more components which share similar economic characteristics and thus are aggregated into a single reporting unit for testing purposes. These two situations are described further
below. This analysis has resulted in the following reporting units for our goodwill testing:

•

Within our Components segment, emission solutions and filtration have been aggregated into a single reporting unit. This
reporting unit accounts for almost 90 percent of our total goodwill balance at December 31, 2010.

•

Also within our Components segment, our turbo technologies business is considered a separate reporting unit.

•

Within our Power Generation segment, our generator technologies business is considered a separate reporting unit.

•

Within our Engine segment, our new and recon parts business is considered a separate reporting unit. This reporting unit
is in the business of selling new parts and remanufacturing and reconditioning engines and certain engine components.

•

Our Distribution segment is considered a single reporting unit as it is managed geographically and all regions share
similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services.

No
other reporting units have goodwill. Our valuation method requires us to make projections of revenue, operating expenses, working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the
reporting units over a multi-year period. Additionally, management must estimate a weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects a market rate, for each reporting unit for use as a
discount rate. The discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and, if less than the carrying value, a separate valuation of the goodwill is required to determine if
an impairment loss has occurred. In addition, we also perform a sensitivity analysis to determine how much our forecasts can fluctuate before the fair value of a reporting unit would be lower than its
carrying amount. As of the end of the third quarter in 2010, we performed the annual impairment assessment required by GAAP and determined that our goodwill was not impaired. At December 31,
2010, our recorded goodwill was $367 million, approximately 90 percent of which resided in the emission solutions plus filtration reporting unit. For this reporting unit, the fair value
of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin. Changes in our projections or estimates, a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect or a
significant increase in the discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units and result in a future impairment of goodwill.



RECENTLY ADOPTED AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted

In July 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended its standards regarding the disclosures for credit quality of
financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses. The objective of the amendment is to provide a greater level of disaggregated information about the credit quality of financing receivables,
the allowance for credit losses, and timely recognition of such losses. Specifically, the amendment requires an entity to disclose credit quality indicators, past due information and modifications of
its financing receivables. The new rules are effective for us beginning December 31, 2010. Our level of receivables that qualify as financing receivables, as defined by the standard, are not
material for disclosure.

In
January 2010, the FASB amended its standards related to fair value measurements and disclosures, which are effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after
December 15, 2009, except for disclosures about certain Level 3 activity which will not become effective until interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010. The
new standard requires us to disclose transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers as well as activity in Level 3
fair value measurements. The new standard also requires a more detailed level of disaggregation of the assets and liabilities being measured as well as increased disclosures regarding inputs and
valuation techniques of the fair value measurements. Our disclosures related to the new standard are included in Note 4, "FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS," to the

Consolidated Financial Statements

.

In
June 2009, the FASB amended its standards for accounting for transfers of financial assets, which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after
November 15, 2009. The new standard removes the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity from GAAP. The new standard modifies the financial components approach used in previous standards
and limits the circumstances in which a financial asset, or portion of a financial asset, should be derecognized. The new standard also requires enhanced disclosure regarding transfers of financial
interests and a transferor's continuing involvement with transferred assets. The new standard requires us to report any activity under our receivable sales program as secured borrowings. As of
December 31, 2010, there were no outstanding amounts under our receivable sales program and there was no significant activity during the year.

In
June 2009, the FASB amended its existing standards related to the consolidation of variable interest entities, which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning
after November 15, 2009. The new standard requires entities to analyze whether their variable interests give it a controlling financial interest of a variable interest entity (VIE) and outlines
what defines a primary beneficiary. The new standard amends GAAP by: (a) changing certain rules for determining whether an entity is a VIE; (b) replacing the quantitative approach
previously required for determining the primary beneficiary with a more qualitative approach; and (c) requiring entities to continuously analyze whether they are the primary beneficiary of a
VIE among other amendments. The new standard also requires enhanced disclosures regarding an entity's involvement in a VIE. The only significant impact of the adoption of this standard was to
deconsolidate Cummins Komatsu Engine Corporation (CKEC) as of January 1, 2010 and to account for CKEC under GAAP for equity method investees. CKEC is an engine manufacturing entity jointly
owned and operated by us and our equity partner. Prior to January 1, 2010, we were deemed the primary beneficiary of this VIE due to the pricing arrangements of purchases and the substantial
volume of purchases we made from the VIE. The impact of the deconsolidation on our

Consolidated Statements of Income

was minimal as all sales were
eliminated in consolidation in the past. The most significant impacts on our

Consolidated Balance Sheets

were to decrease current assets by
$9 million, decrease long-term assets by $10 million, increase investments and advances related to equity method investees by $11 million and decrease noncontrolling
interest by $11 million.



Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Effective

In October 2009, the FASB amended its rules regarding the accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements. The objective of the
amendment is to allow vendors to account for revenue for different deliverables separately as opposed to part of a combined unit when those deliverables are provided at different times. Specifically,
this amendment addresses how to separate deliverables and simplifies the process of allocating revenue to the different deliverables when more than one deliverable exists. The new rules are effective
for us beginning January 1, 2011. We do not believe this amendment will have a significant impact on our

Consolidated Financial Statements

.

ITEM 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. This risk is
closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swap contracts and interest rate swaps. As stated in our
policies and procedures, financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes, and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes. When material, we adjust the value of our
derivative contracts for counter-party or our credit risk. The results and status of our hedging transactions are reported to senior management on a monthly and quarterly basis.

Further
information regarding financial instruments and risk management is contained in Note 19, "DERIVATIVES," to our

Consolidated Financial
Statements

.

The
following describes our risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analysis performed as of December 31, 2010. The sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous, parallel
shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.

Foreign Exchange Rates

As a result of our international business presence, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks. We transact business in foreign
currencies and, as a result, our income
experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. To help manage our exposure to exchange rate volatility, we use foreign exchange forward contracts on a regular
basis to hedge forecasted intercompany and third-party sales and purchases denominated in non-functional currencies. Our internal policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency
cash flows for up to one year. These foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges under GAAP. The effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss
on the forward contract is deferred and reported as a component of "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" (AOCL). When the hedged forecasted transaction (sale or purchase) occurs, the unrealized gain
or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income. The ineffective
portion of the hedge, unrealized gain or loss, if any, is recognized in current income during the period of change. As of December 31, 2010, the amount we expect to reclassify from AOCL to
income over the next year is a net unrealized loss of $1 million. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no circumstances that would have resulted in the
discontinuance of a foreign currency cash flow hedge.

To
minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, we enter into foreign
currency forward contracts, which are considered economic hedges. The objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward
contract. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under GAAP.

As
of December 31, 2010, the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the
currencies of such contracts,



would
be approximately $52 million. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next
12 months. The analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels. It should be noted that any change in the value of
the contracts, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items (see Note 19, "DERIVATIVES," to our

Consolidated Financial Statements

).

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. We manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use
of interest rate swaps. The objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk.

In
November 2005, we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert our $250 million debt issue, due in 2028, from a fixed rate of 7.125% to a floating rate based on a
LIBOR spread. The terms of the swap mirror those of the debt, with interest paid semi-annually. This swap qualifies as a fair value hedge under GAAP. The gain or loss on this derivative
instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current income as "Interest expense." The following table summarizes these gains
and losses for the years presented below:

Commodity Price Risk

We are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers. In order to protect
ourselves against future price volatility and, consequently, fluctuations in gross margins, we periodically enter into commodity swap contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw
material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations. The swap contracts are derivative contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges
under GAAP. The effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss is deferred and reported as a component of AOCL. When the hedged forecasted transaction (purchase) occurs, the unrealized gain or loss
is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income. The ineffective portion of
the hedge, if any, is recognized in current income in the period in which the ineffectiveness occurs. As of December 31, 2010, we expect to reclassify an unrealized net gain of
$15 million from AOCL to income over the next year. For the year ended December 31, 2010, there were no material circumstances that would have resulted in the discontinuance of a cash
flow hedge. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we discontinued hedge accounting on certain contracts where the forecasted transactions were no longer probable. The amount reclassified to
income as a result of this action was a loss of $4 million. Our internal policy allows for managing these cash flow hedges for up to three years.

As
of December 31, 2010, the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity swap contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the price of such
commodities, was $8 million. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months. The analysis
ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels. It should be noted that any change in the value of the swap contracts, real or
hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items (see Note 19, "DERIVATIVES," to the

Consolidated Financial
Statements

).

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS

Management's Report on Financial Statements and Practices

The accompanying

Consolidated Financial Statements

of our Company were prepared by
management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts that are based on
management's best judgments and estimates. The other financial information included in the annual report is consistent with that in the financial statements.

Management
also recognizes its responsibility for conducting our affairs according to the highest standards of personal and corporate conduct. This responsibility is characterized and
reflected in key policy statements issued from time to time regarding, among other things, conduct of its business
activities within the laws of the host countries in which we operate, within The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and potentially conflicting interests of its employees. We maintain a systematic program
to assess compliance with these policies.

To
comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we designed and implemented a structured and comprehensive compliance process to evaluate our
internal control over financial reporting across the enterprise.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company's internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of the Company's

Consolidated Financial Statements

for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Management
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and concluded it was effective as of December 31, 2010. In making its assessment, management
utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework.

The
effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Cummins Inc.:

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cummins Inc. and its
subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying "Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting." Our responsibility
is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations

Cummins Inc. was founded in 1919 as a corporation in Columbus, Indiana, as one of the first diesel engine manufacturers. We are
a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines, electric power generation systems and engine-related component products, including
filtration, exhaust aftertreatment, fuel systems, controls and air handling systems. We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and other customers worldwide. We
serve our customers through a network of more than 600 company-owned and independent distributor locations and more than 6,000 dealer locations in more than 190 countries and territories.

Principles of Consolidation

Our

Consolidated Financial Statements

include the accounts of all wholly-owned and
majority-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries where our ownership is more than 50 percent of common stock except for majority-owned subsidiaries that are considered variable interest
entities (VIEs) where we are not deemed to have a controlling financial interest. In addition, we also
consolidate, regardless of our ownership percentage, VIEs for which we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest. See "Recently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements" below
for revised VIE standards effective January 1, 2010. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Where our ownership interest is less than 100 percent, the
noncontrolling ownership interests are reported in our

Consolidated Balance Sheets

. The noncontrolling ownership interest in our income, net of tax, is
classified as "Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests" in our

Consolidated Statements of Income

. Certain amounts for 2009 and 2008 have
been reclassified to conform to the current classifications.

Investments in Equity Investees

We use the equity method to account for our investments in joint ventures, affiliated companies and alliances in which we have the
ability to exercise significant influence, generally represented by common stock ownership or partnership equity of at least 20 percent but not more than 50 percent. Generally, under the
equity method, original investments in these entities are recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted by our share of equity in income or losses after the date of acquisition. Investment amounts in
excess of our share of an investee's assets are amortized over the life of the related asset creating the excess. If the excess is goodwill, then it is not amortized. Equity in income or losses of
each investee is recorded according to our level of ownership; if losses accumulate, we record our share of losses until our investment has been fully depleted. If our investment has been fully
depleted, we recognize additional losses only when we are the primary funding source. We eliminate (to the extent of our ownership percentage) in our

Consolidated Financial
Statements

the profit in inventory held by our equity method investees that has not yet been sold to a third-party. Our investments are classified as "Investments and advances
related to equity method investees" in our

Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Our share of the results from joint ventures, affiliated companies and alliances
is reported in our

Consolidated Statements of Income

as "Equity, royalty and interest income from investees," and is reported net of all applicable
income taxes.

Our
foreign equity investees are presented net of applicable foreign income taxes in our

Consolidated Statements of Income

. The vast
majority of our United States (U.S.) equity investees are



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

partnerships
(non-taxable), thus there is no difference between gross or net of tax presentation as the investees are not taxed.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of the Financial Statements

Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP)
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts presented and disclosed in our

Consolidated Financial Statements

.
Significant estimates and assumptions in these

Consolidated Financial Statements

require the exercise of judgment and are used for, but not limited to,
allowance for doubtful accounts, estimates of future cash flows and other assumptions associated with goodwill and long-lived asset impairment tests, useful lives for depreciation and
amortization, warranty programs, determination of discount and other rate assumptions for pension and other postretirement benefit expenses, restructuring costs, income taxes and deferred tax
valuation allowances, lease classification, and contingencies. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be different from these
estimates.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue, net of estimated costs of returns, allowances and sales incentives, when it is realized or realizable, which
generally occurs when:

•

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,

•

The product has been shipped and legal title and all risks of ownership have been transferred,

•

Customer acceptance has occurred and

•

Payment is reasonably assured.

Products
are generally sold on open account under credit terms customary to the geographic region of distribution. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do
not require collateral to secure our accounts receivable. For engines, service parts, service tools and other items sold to independent distributors and to partially-owned distributors accounted for
under the equity method, revenues are recorded when title and risk of ownership transfers. This transfer is based on the agreement in effect with the respective distributor and in the U.S. and most
international locations generally occurs when the products are shipped. To the extent of our ownership percentage, margins on sales to distributors accounted for under the equity method are deferred
until the distributor sells the product to unrelated parties.

We
provide various sales incentives to both our distribution network and our OEM customers. These programs are designed to promote the sale of our product in the channel or encourage the
usage of our products by OEM customers. Sales incentives primarily fall into three categories:

•

Volume rebates,

•

Market share rebates and

•

Aftermarket rebates.



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

For
volume rebates, we provide certain customers with rebate opportunities for attaining specified volumes during a particular quarter or year. We accrue for the expected amount of these
rebates at the time of the original sale and update our accruals quarterly based on our best estimate of the volume levels the customer will reach during the measurement period. For market share
rebates, we provide certain customers with rebate opportunities based on the percentage of their production that utilizes a Cummins product. These rebates are typically measured either quarterly or
annually and are accrued at the time of the original sale based on the current market shares, with adjustments made as the level changes. For aftermarket rebates we provide incentives to promote sales
to certain dealers and end-markets. These rebates are typically paid on a quarterly, or more frequent, basis and estimates are made at the end of each quarter as to the amount yet to be
paid. These estimates are based on historical experience with the particular program. The incentives are classified as a reduction in sales in our

Consolidated Statements of
Income

.

Rights
of return do not exist for a large portion of our sales, other than for quality issues. We do offer certain return rights in our aftermarket business, where some aftermarket
customers are permitted to return small amounts of parts and filters each year and in our power generation business, which sells portable generators to retail customers. An estimate of future returns
is accrued at the time of sale based on historical return rates.

Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation

We translate assets and liabilities of foreign entities to U.S. dollars, where the local currency is the functional currency, at
year-end exchange rates. We translate income and expenses to U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates for the year. We record adjustments resulting from translation in a separate
component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and include the adjustments in net income only upon sale or liquidation of the underlying foreign investment.

Foreign
currency transaction gains and losses are included in current net income. For foreign entities where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, including those operating in
highly inflationary economies when applicable, we remeasure inventory, property, plant and equipment balances and the related income statement using historical exchange rates. We include in income the
resulting gains and losses, including the effect of derivatives in our

Consolidated Statements of Income

, which combined with transaction gains and
losses amounted to a net loss of $1 million in 2010, net loss of $20 million in 2009 and a net loss of $46 million in 2008.

Derivative Instruments

We make use of derivative instruments in foreign exchange, commodity price and interest rate hedging programs. Derivatives currently in
use are foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swap contracts and an interest rate swap. These contracts are used strictly for hedging and not for speculative purposes.

Due
to our international business presence, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. We transact in foreign currencies and have significant assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies. Consequently, our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to benefit from global diversification and after considering
naturally offsetting currency positions, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize our existing exposures (recognized assets and liabilities) and hedge forecasted transactions.



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

We
are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers. In order to protect ourselves against future price volatility and,
consequently, fluctuations in gross margins, we periodically enter into commodity swap contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases with the objective of
minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations.

We
record all derivatives at fair value in our financial statements. Note 19, "DERIVATIVES" provides further information on our hedging strategy and accounting for derivative
financial instruments.

Income Tax Accounting

We determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future tax benefits
of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future
profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2010, we recorded net deferred tax assets of
$511 million. These assets included $139 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance of $50 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to
the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized. In the event our operating performance deteriorates, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will
be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex
issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax
positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available. A more complete description
of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in Note 6, "INCOME TAXES".

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents are defined as short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less
at the time of purchase. The carrying amounts reflected in our

Consolidated Balance Sheets

for cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to
the short-term maturity of these investments.

Marketable Securities

We account for marketable securities in accordance with GAAP for certain investments in debt and equity securities. We determine the
appropriate classification of all marketable securities as "held-to-maturity, "available-for-sale" or "trading" at the time of purchase, and
re-evaluate such classifications at each balance sheet date. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, all of our investments were classified as available-for-sale.

Available-for-sale
securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gain or loss, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income. Unrealized losses
considered to be "other-than-temporary" are recognized currently in income. The cost of
securities sold is based on the specific identification method. The fair value of most investment securities is determined by currently available market prices. Where quoted market prices are not
available, we use the market price of similar types of securities that are traded in the market to estimate fair value. See Note 3, "MARKETABLE SECURITIES," for a detailed description of our
investments in marketable securities.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, which approximates fair value, and generally do not bear interest. We
have a trade receivables sales program, which is more fully discussed in Note 23, "SALES OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE," which allows us to sell, without recourse, an interest in a pool of our trade
receivables to a financial institution as necessary. The allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine
the allowance based on our historical collection experience and by performing an analysis of our accounts receivable in light of the current economic environment. We review our allowance for doubtful
accounts on a regular basis. In addition, when necessary, we provide an allowance for the full amount of specific accounts deemed to be uncollectible. Account balances are

Inventories

Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009,
approximately 16 percent of our consolidated inventories (primarily heavy-duty and high-horsepower engines and parts) were valued using the last-in,
first-out (LIFO) cost method. The cost of other inventories is generally valued using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method. Our inventories at interim and
year-end reporting dates include estimates for adjustments related to annual physical inventory results and for inventory cost changes under the LIFO cost method. Due to significant
movements of partially-manufactured components and parts between manufacturing plants, we do not internally measure, nor do our accounting systems provide, a meaningful segregation between raw
materials and work-in-process.

Property, Plant and Equipment

We record property, plant and equipment, inclusive of assets under capital leases, at cost. We depreciate the cost of the majority of
engine production equipment using a modified units-of-production method, which is based upon units produced subject to a minimum level. We depreciate the cost of all other
equipment using the straight-line method with depreciable lives ranging from 20 to 40 years for buildings and three to 20 years for machinery, equipment and fixtures. Capital
lease amortization is recorded in depreciation expense. We expense normal maintenance and repair costs as incurred. Depreciation expense totaled $248 million, $269 million and
$262 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Long-Lived Assets

We review our long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value
of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of the long-lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are
largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. An impairment of a long-lived asset or asset group exists when the expected future pre-tax cash flows
(undiscounted and without interest charges) estimated to be generated by the asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset or
asset group, an impairment loss is measured based on the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the asset or asset group. Assumptions and estimates used to estimate cash
flows in the evaluation of impairment and the fair values used to determine the impairment are subject to a degree of judgment and complexity. Any



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

changes
to the assumptions and estimates resulting from changes in actual results or market conditions from those anticipated may affect the carrying value of long-lived assets and could
result in a future impairment charge.

Goodwill

Under GAAP for goodwill and other intangible assets, the carrying value of goodwill must be tested for impairment on an annual basis
and between annual tests in certain circumstances where impairment may be indicated. The fair value of each reporting unit was estimated by discounting the future cash flows less requirements for
working capital and fixed asset additions. In accordance with GAAP, our reporting units are generally defined as one level below an operating segment. However, there were two situations where we have
aggregated two or more components which share similar economic characteristics and thus are aggregated into a single reporting unit for testing purposes. These two situations are described further
below. This analysis has resulted in the following reporting units for our goodwill testing:

•

Within our Components segment, emission solutions and filtration have been aggregated into a single reporting unit. This
reporting unit accounts for almost 90 percent of our total goodwill balance at December 31, 2010.

•

Also within our Components segment, our turbo technologies business is considered a separate reporting unit.

•

Within our Power Generation segment, our generator technologies business is considered a separate reporting unit.

•

Within our Engine segment, our new and recon parts business is considered a separate reporting unit. This reporting unit
is in the business of selling new parts and remanufacturing and reconditioning engines and certain engine components.

•

Our Distribution segment is considered a single reporting unit as it is managed geographically and all regions share
similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services.

No
other reporting units have goodwill. Our valuation method requires us to make projections of revenue, operating expenses, working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the
reporting units over a multi-year period. Additionally, management must estimate a weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects a market rate, for each reporting unit for use as a
discount rate. The discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and, if less than the carrying value, a separate valuation of the goodwill is required to determine if
an impairment loss has occurred. In addition, we also perform a sensitivity analysis to determine how much our forecasts can fluctuate before the fair value of a reporting unit would be lower than its
carrying amount. As of the end of the third quarter in 2010, we performed the annual impairment assessment required by GAAP and determined that our goodwill was not impaired. At December 31,
2010, our recorded goodwill was $367 million, approximately 90 percent of which resided in the emission solutions plus filtration reporting unit. For this reporting unit, the fair value
of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin. Changes in our projections or estimates, a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect or a
significant increase in the discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units and result in a future impairment of goodwill.



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Software

We capitalize certain costs for software that are developed or obtained for internal use. Software costs are amortized on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives generally ranging from three to five years. Software assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may not be recoverable over the remaining lives of the assets. Upgrades and enhancements are capitalized if they result in significant modifications that enable the software to perform
tasks it was previously incapable of performing. Software maintenance, training, data conversion and business process reengineering costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.

Warranty

We charge the estimated costs of warranty programs, other than product recalls, to income at the time products are shipped to
customers. We use historical experience of warranty programs to estimate the remaining liability for our various warranty programs. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency
of product recall programs, the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action, which generally occurs when it is announced. We review and assess the liability for these
programs on a quarterly basis. We also assess our ability to recover certain costs from our suppliers and record a receivable from the supplier when we believe a recovery is probable. At
December 31, 2010, we had $12 million of receivables related to estimated supplier recoveries of which $7 million was included in "Trade and other receivables, net" and
$5 million was included in "Other assets" on our

Consolidated Balance Sheets

. At December 31, 2009, we had $10 million of
receivables related to estimated supplier recoveries of which $5 million was included in "Trade and other receivables, net" and $5 million was included in "Other assets" on our

Consolidated Balance
Sheets

.

In
addition, we sell extended warranty coverage on most of our engines. The revenue collected is initially deferred and is recognized as revenue in proportion to the costs expected to be
incurred in performing services over the contract period. We compare the remaining deferred revenue balance quarterly to the estimated amount of future claims under extended warranty programs and
provide an additional accrual when the deferred revenue balance is less than expected future costs.

Research and Development

Our research and development program is focused on product improvements, innovations and cost reductions for our customers. We expense
research and development expenditures, net of contract reimbursements, when incurred. Research and development expenses, net of contract reimbursements, were $402 million in 2010,
$362 million in 2009 and $422 million in 2008. Contract reimbursements were $68 million in 2010, $92 million in 2009 and $61 million in 2008.

Related Party Transactions

In accordance with the provisions of various joint venture agreements, we may purchase products and components from the joint ventures,
sell products and components to the joint ventures and the joint ventures may sell products and components to unrelated parties. Joint venture transfer prices to us may differ from normal selling
prices. Certain joint venture agreements transfer product to us at cost, some transfer product to us on a cost-plus basis, and others transfer product to us at market

RECENTLY ADOPTED AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted

In July 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended its standards regarding the disclosures for credit quality of
financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses. The objective of the amendment is to provide a greater level of disaggregated information about the credit quality of financing receivables,
the allowance for credit losses, and timely recognition of such losses. Specifically, the amendment requires an entity to disclose credit quality indicators, past due information and modifications of
its financing receivables. The new rules are effective for us beginning December 31, 2010. Our level of receivables that qualify as financing receivables, as defined by the standard, are not
material for disclosure.

In
January 2010, the FASB amended its standards related to fair value measurements and disclosures, which are effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after
December 15, 2009, except for disclosures about certain Level 3 activity which will not become effective until interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010. The
new standard requires us to disclose transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers as well as activity in Level 3
fair value measurements. The new standard also requires a more detailed level of disaggregation of the assets and liabilities being measured as well as increased disclosures regarding inputs and
valuation techniques of the fair value measurements. Our disclosures related to the new standard are included in Note 4, "FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS," to the

Consolidated Financial Statements

.

In
June 2009, the FASB amended its standards for accounting for transfers of financial assets, which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after
November 15, 2009. The new standard removes the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity from GAAP. The new standard modifies the financial components approach used in previous standards
and limits the circumstances in which a financial asset, or portion of a financial asset, should be derecognized. The new standard also requires enhanced disclosure regarding transfers of financial
interests and a transferor's continuing involvement with transferred assets. The new standard requires us to report any activity under our receivable sales program as secured borrowings. As of
December 31, 2010, there were no outstanding amounts under our receivable sales program and there was no significant activity during the year.

In
June 2009, the FASB amended its existing standards related to the consolidation of variable interest entities, which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning
after November 15, 2009. The new standard requires entities to analyze whether their variable interests give it a controlling financial interest of a variable interest entity (VIE) and outlines
what defines a primary beneficiary. The new standard amends GAAP by: (a) changing certain rules for determining whether an entity is a VIE; (b) replacing the quantitative approach
previously required for determining the primary beneficiary with a more qualitative approach; and (c) requiring entities to continuously analyze whether they are the primary beneficiary of a
VIE among other amendments. The new standard also requires enhanced disclosures regarding an entity's involvement in a VIE. The only significant impact of the adoption of this standard was to
deconsolidate Cummins Komatsu Engine Corporation (CKEC) as of January 1, 2010 and to account for CKEC under GAAP for equity method investees. CKEC is an



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

engine
manufacturing entity jointly owned and operated by us and our equity partner. Prior to January 1, 2010, we were deemed the primary beneficiary of this VIE due to the pricing arrangements
of purchases and the substantial volume of purchases we made from the VIE. The impact of the deconsolidation on our

Consolidated Statements of Income

was minimal as all sales were eliminated in consolidation in the past. The most significant impacts on our

Consolidated Balance Sheets

were to decrease
current assets by $9 million, decrease long-term assets by $10 million, increase investments and advances related to equity method investees by $11 million and
decrease noncontrolling interest by $11 million.

Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Effective

In October 2009, the FASB amended its rules regarding the accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements. The objective of the
amendment is to allow vendors to account for revenue for different deliverables separately as opposed to part of a combined unit when those deliverables are provided at different times. Specifically,
this amendment addresses how to separate deliverables and simplifies the process of allocating revenue to the different deliverables when more than one deliverable exists. The new rules are effective
for us beginning January 1, 2011. We do not believe this amendment will have a significant impact on our

Consolidated Financial Statements

Distribution Entities

We have an extensive worldwide distributor and dealer network through which we sell and distribute our products and services.
Generally, our distributors are divided by geographic region with some of our distributors being wholly-owned by Cummins, some partially-owned and the majority independently owned. We consolidate all
wholly-owned distributors and partially-owned distributors where we are the primary beneficiary and account for other partially-owned distributors using the equity method of accounting.

•

North American Distributors

—Our distribution channel in North
America includes 12 partially-owned distributors. Our equity interests in these nonconsolidated entities range from 30 percent to 50 percent. We also have an approximate
80 percent ownership interest in three partially owned distributors which we consolidate. While each distributor is a separate legal entity, the business of each is the same as that of our
wholly-owned distributors based in other parts of the world. All of our distributors, irrespective of their legal structure or ownership, offer the full range of our products and services to customers
and end-users in their respective markets.

We
are contractually obligated to repurchase new engines, parts and components, special tools and signage from our North American distributors following an ownership transfer or
termination of the distributor. In addition, in certain cases where we own a partial interest in a distributor, we are obligated to purchase the other equity holders' interests if certain events occur
(such as the death of the distributor principal or a change in control of Cummins Inc.). The purchase price of the equity interests is determined based on the fair value of the distributor's
assets. Outside of North America, repurchase obligations and practices vary by region. All distributors that are partially-owned are considered to be related parties in our

NOTE 4. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

In January 2010, the FASB amended its standards related to fair value measurements and disclosures, which are effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after
December 15, 2009, except for disclosures about certain Level 3 activity which will not become effective until interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010. The
new standard requires us to disclose transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers as well as activity in Level 3
fair value measurements. The new standard also requires a more detailed level of disaggregation of the assets and liabilities being measured as well as increased disclosures regarding inputs and
valuation techniques of the fair value measurements. The amended



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 4. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued)

standards
do not require retroactive restatement of prior periods. The adoption did not materially impact our

Consolidated Financial Statements

.

Fair
value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit
price). We utilize market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the
valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable. We primarily apply the market approach for recurring fair value measurements and utilize
the best available information. Accordingly, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. We are able to classify fair value
balances based on the observability of those inputs. The amended standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest
priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined by GAAP are as follows:

Level 1—Quoted
prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or
liability occur in
sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as listed equities and publicly traded bonds.

Level 2—Pricing
inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date.
Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various
assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant
economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, can be derived from observable data or are supported by
observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this category include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as
over-the-counter forwards and options.

Level 3—Pricing
inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that
result in management's best estimate of fair value. At each balance sheet date, we perform an analysis of all instruments subject to fair value accounting under GAAP and include, in Level 3,
all of those whose fair value is based on significant unobservable inputs. At December 31, 2010, we did not have any Level 3 financial assets or liabilities, other than those in our
pension plan (see Note 11, "PENSION BENEFITS AND OTHER POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS").

The
majority of the assets and liabilities we carry at fair value are available-for-sale (AFS) securities and derivatives. AFS securities are derived from
Level 1 or Level 2 inputs. The predominance of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party
pricing services. The fair value measurement of derivatives results primarily from Level 2 inputs. Many of our derivative contracts are valued utilizing publicly available pricing data of
contracts with similar terms. In other cases, the contracts are valued using current spot market data adjusted for the appropriate current forward curves provided by



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

external
financial institutions. We participate in commodity swap contracts, currency forward contracts, and interest rate swaps. When material, we adjust the values of our derivative contracts for
counter-party or our credit risk. There were no transfers into or out of Levels 2 or 3 during 2010.

The
substantial majority of our assets were valued utilizing a market approach. A description of the valuation techniques and inputs used for our Level 2 fair value measures are
as follows:

Debt mutual funds

—Assets in Level 2 consist of exchange traded mutual funds that lack sufficient trading volume to be classified at
Level 1. The fair value measure for these investments is the daily net asset value published on a regulated governmental website. Daily quoted prices are available from the issuing brokerage
and are used on a test basis to corroborate this Level 2 input.

Bank debentures and Certificates of deposit

—These investments provide us with a fixed rate of return and generally range in maturity from six months
to one year. The counter-parties to these investments are reputable financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. Since these instruments are not tradable and must be settled directly
by Cummins with the respective financial institution, our fair value measure is the financial institutions' month-end statement.



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 4. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued)

Government debt securities—non-U.S. and Corporate debt securities

—The fair value measure for these securities are broker
quotes received from reputable firms. These securities are infrequently traded on a national stock exchange and these values are used on a test basis to corroborate our Level 2 input measure.

Foreign currency forward contracts

—The fair value measure for these contracts are determined based on forward foreign exchange rates received from
third-party pricing services. These rates are based upon market transactions and are periodically corroborated by comparing to third-party broker quotes.

Commodity swap contracts

—The fair value measure for these contracts are current spot market data adjusted for the appropriate current forward curves
provided by external financial institutions. The current spot price is the most significant component of this valuation and is based upon market transactions. We use third-party pricing services for
the spot price component of this valuation which is periodically corroborated by market data from broker quotes.

Interest rate contracts

—We currently have only one interest rate contract. We utilize the month-end statement from the issuing financial
institution as our fair value measure for this investment. We corroborate this valuation through the use of a third-party pricing service for similar assets and liabilities.

Retained
earnings of the United Kingdom (U.K.) group and certain Singapore, German, and Indian subsidiaries are considered to be permanently reinvested. The determination of the deferred
tax liability, if any, that might be due should that income be distributed is not practicable. However, we may periodically repatriate a portion of these earnings to the extent we can do so
essentially tax-free, or at minimal cost. For our remaining subsidiary companies and joint ventures outside the U.S., we provide for the additional taxes that would be due upon the
dividend distribution of the income of those foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures assuming the full utilization of foreign tax credits. During 2010, we released $3 million of U.S. deferred
tax liabilities related to prior years unremitted income of certain German and Indian subsidiaries of our U.K. group now considered to also be permanently reinvested. Income before income taxes

business credit carryforward benefits that begin to expire in 2029, and $54 million of state credit and net operating loss carryforward benefits that begin to expire in 2012. Our foreign
carryforward benefits include $33 million of net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2013. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the gross deferred tax assets to an
amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. The valuation allowance increased in 2010 by a net $6 million and increased in 2009 by a net $19 million. The valuation
allowance is primarily attributable to the uncertainty regarding the realization of a portion of the U.S. state and foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits. Other liabilities
and deferred revenue includes deferred tax liabilities of $6 million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Included
in the December 31, 2010 and 2009, balances are $33 million related to tax positions that, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective tax rate in future
periods. Also, we had accrued interest expense related to the unrecognized tax benefits of $30 million, $22 million and $14 million as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. During the years ending December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we
recognized approximately $5 million, $4 million and $2 million in net interest expense, respectively.

It
is reasonably possible that the liability associated with the unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease within the next 12 months. These changes may be the result of ongoing
audits or the expiration of statutes of limitations and could range from $0 to $60 million based on current estimates. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to
significant uncertainty. Although we believe that adequate provision has been made for such issues, there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on
our earnings. Conversely, if these issues are resolved favorably in the future, the related provision would be reduced, thus having a positive impact on earnings. It is anticipated that audit
settlements will be reached during 2011 that could have a significant earnings impact. Due to the uncertainty of amounts and in accordance with our accounting policies, we have not recorded any
potential impact of these settlements.

As
a result of our global operations, we file income tax returns in various jurisdictions including U.S. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. We are routinely subject to examination
by taxing authorities throughout the world, including Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, India, Mexico, the U.K. and the U.S. Our U.S. federal income tax returns have been examined
through 2005. With few exceptions, major state and foreign jurisdictions are no longer subject to income tax examinations for years before 2005.

On July 16, 2010, we entered into a four-year revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders. The credit
agreement provides us with a $1.24 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, the proceeds of which are to be used by us for working capital or other general corporate purposes.

The
credit facility matures on July 16, 2014. Amounts payable under our revolving credit facility will rank pro rata with all of our unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness. Up to
$150 million under our credit facility is available for swingline loans denominated in U.S. dollars. Advances under the facility bear interest at (i) a base rate or (ii) a rate
equal to the LIBOR Rate plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of our outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt. Based on our current long-term debt ratings,
the applicable margin on LIBOR Rate loans was 2.00 percent per annum as of December 31, 2010. Advances under the facility may be prepaid without premium or penalty, subject to customary
breakage costs.

The
credit agreement includes various covenants, including, among others, maintaining a leverage ratio of no more than 3.0 to 1.0 and maintaining an interest coverage ratio of at least
1.5 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all such covenants.

The
table below is a reconciliation of the maximum capacity of our revolver to the amount available under the facility as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. There were no outstanding
borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2010.

or an amount designed to ensure that the debenture holders are not penalized by the early redemption.

During
2010, two of our wholly-owned Brazilian subsidiaries entered into a loan agreement for a loan in local currency in an amount equivalent to US $50 million, at drawdown, at a
fixed rate of 4.5 percent to finance its exports over the next three years. The principal of the loan has a two-year grace period and will begin amortizing in 2012.

In
October 2009, one wholly-owned subsidiary, Cummins Brasil Ltda, entered into a loan agreement with the Brazil development bank, BNDES, for a loan in local currency in an amount
equivalent to US $45 million, at drawdown, at a fixed rate of 4.5 percent to finance its exports over the next three years. The principal of the loan has a two-year grace
period and will begin amortizing in 2011.

Our
debt agreements contain several restrictive covenants. The most restrictive of these covenants applies to our revolving credit facility which will, among other things, limit our
ability to incur

December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our borrowing agreements.

NOTE 10. PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY

We charge the estimated costs of warranty programs, other than product recalls, to income at the time products are shipped to customers. We use historical claims experience to develop
the estimated liability. We review product recall programs on a quarterly basis and, if necessary, record a liability when we commit to an action, which is reflected in the provision for warranties
issued line. We also sell extended warranty coverage on several engines. The following is a tabular reconciliation of the product warranty liability, including the deferred revenue related to our

NOTE 10. PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY (Continued)

During
2009, actual cost trends for certain midrange engine products, including products launched in 2007 and for which warranty periods can extend to five years, indicated higher per
claim repair cost than the products on which the initial accrual rate was developed. These products include more electronic parts than historical models contributing to the higher cost per claim. In
addition, certain products introduced in 2003 and sold prior to 2007 for which the warranty period extended five years also demonstrated a higher cost per claim than that of predecessor products. We
increased our liability in 2009 as these experience trends became evident.

NOTE 11. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

PENSION PLANS

We sponsor several contributory and noncontributory pension plans covering substantially all employees. Generally, hourly employee
pension benefits are earned based on years of service and compensation during active employment while future benefits for salaried employees are determined using a cash balance formula. However, the
level of benefits and terms of vesting may vary among plans. Pension plan assets are administered by trustees and are principally invested in equity securities and fixed income securities. It is our
policy to make contributions to our various qualified plans in accordance with statutory and contractual funding requirements and any additional contributions we determine are appropriate.

Obligations, Assets and Funded Status

The following tables present the changes in the benefit obligations and the various plan assets, the funded status of the plans, and

As
disclosed in Note 22, "RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES," we executed restructuring actions in 2009. As a result, our pension benefit plans were remeasured and we recognized
curtailment losses, as prescribed under GAAP pension standards, due to the significant reduction in the expected aggregate years of future service of the employees affected by the actions. In 2009, we
recorded net curtailment losses of $5 million and $1 million for U.S. and non-U.S. plans, respectively, and $2 million for our less significant plans in other
countries outside the U.S. and the U.K. The curtailment losses include recognition of the change in the PBO and a portion of the previously unrecognized prior service cost reflecting the reduction in
expected future service.

Plan Assets

Our investment policies in the U.S. and U.K. provide for the rebalancing of assets to maintain our long-term strategic
asset allocation. We are committed to its long-term strategy and do not attempt to time the market given empirical evidence that asset allocation is more critical than individual asset or
investment manager selection. Rebalancing of the assets has and continues to occur. The rebalancing is critical to having the proper weighting of assets to achieve the expected total portfolio
returns. We believe that our portfolio is highly diversified and does not have any significant exposure to concentration risk. The plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans do not include any
of our common stock.

U.S. Plan Assets

For the U.S. qualified pension plans, our assumption for the expected return on assets was 8.0 percent in 2010. Projected
returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management. We expect additional positive returns
from this active investment management. Based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations, we have elected to use an assumption of 8.0 percent per year in 2011.

The
primary investment objective is to exceed, on a net-of-fee basis, the rate of return of a policy portfolio comprised of the following:

NOTE 11. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (Continued)

The fixed income component is structured to represent a custom bond benchmark constructed to closely represent the monthly change in the value of our liabilities. This component is
structured in such a way that its benchmark covers 50 percent of the plan's exposure to changes in its discount rate (AA corporate bond yields). In order to achieve a hedge on more than the
targeted 30 percent of plan assets invested in fixed income securities, the benefits policy committee may instruct the fixed income managers, other managers or the custodian/trustee to utilize
derivative securities in an overlay fashion, which would further reduce the plan's risk of declining interest rates in what is referred to as a liability driven investment strategy. However, all
managers hired to manage assets for the trust are prohibited from using leverage unless specifically discussed with the committee and allowed for in their guidelines.

UK Plan Assets

The methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the U.K. was based on establishing an
equity-risk premium over current long-term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations. Our strategy with respect to our investments in these assets is to be
invested in a suitable mixture of return-seeking assets (equities and real estate) and liability matching assets (bonds) with a long-term outlook. Therefore, the risk and return balance of
our U.K. asset portfolio should reflect a long-term horizon. To achieve these objectives we have established the following targets:

The
investments in private equity and real estate funds, for which quoted market prices are not available, are valued at their estimated fair value as determined by applicable investment
managers or by quarterly financial statements of the funds. These financial statements are audited at least annually. The fair value of all real estate properties, held in the partnerships, are valued
at least once per year by an independent professional real estate valuation firm. Fair value generally represents the fund's proportionate share of the net assets of the investment partnerships as
reported by the general partners of the underlying partnerships. Some securities with no readily available market are initially valued at cost, utilizing independent professional valuation firms as
well as market comparisons with subsequent adjustments to values which reflect either the basis of meaningful third-party transactions in the private market or the fair value deemed appropriate by the
general partners of the underlying investment partnerships. In such instances, consideration is also given to the financial condition and operating results of the issuer, the amount that the
investment partnerships can reasonably expect to realize upon the sale of the securities and any other factors deemed relevant. The estimated fair values are subject to uncertainty and therefore may
differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market for such investments existed and such differences could be material.

Estimated Future Contributions and Benefit Payments

We plan to contribute approximately $130 million to our defined benefit pension plans in 2011. The table below presents expected

Other Pension Plans

We also sponsor defined contribution plans for certain hourly and salaried employees. Our contributions to these plans were
$44 million, $42 million and $30 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

Our other postretirement benefit plans provide various health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees, who retire and
satisfy certain age and service requirements, and their dependents. The plans are contributory and contain cost-sharing features such as caps, deductibles, coinsurance and spousal
contributions. Employer contributions are limited by formulas in each plan. Retiree contributions for health care benefits are adjusted annually and we reserve the right to change benefits covered
under these plans. There were no plan assets for the postretirement benefit plans as our policy is to fund benefits and expenses for these plans as claims and premiums are incurred.

The

As
disclosed in Note 22, "RESTUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES," we executed restructuring actions in 2009. As a result, our U.S. postretirement benefit plans were remeasured and we
recognized curtailment losses, as prescribed under GAAP other postretirement benefit standards, due to the significant reduction in the expected aggregate years of future service of the employees
affected by the actions. In 2009, we recorded net curtailment losses of $6 million. The curtailment losses include recognition of the change in the APBO and a portion of the previously
unrecognized prior service cost reflecting the reduction in expected future service.

Our
consolidated other postretirement benefit obligation is determined by application of the terms of health care and life insurance plans, together with relevant actuarial assumptions
and health care cost trend rates. For measurement purposes, an 8.00 percent annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed in 2010. The rate was
assumed to remain at 8.00 percent for three years and then decrease on a linear basis to 5.00 percent through 2019 and remain at that level thereafter. An increase in the health care
cost trends of one percent would increase our APBO by $20 million as of December 31, 2010 and the net periodic other postretirement benefit expense for 2011 by $1 million. A
decrease in the health care cost trends of one percent would decrease our APBO by $17 million as of December 31, 2010 and the net periodic other postretirement benefit expense for 2011
by $1 million.

The
Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 was reflected in the APBO beginning December 31, 2004, assuming we will continue to provide a prescription
drug benefit
to retirees that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D and we will receive the federal subsidy. We received a subsidy of approximately $4 million in 2010 and
$5 million in 2009.

NOTE 13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

We are subject to numerous lawsuits and claims arising out of the ordinary course of our business, including actions related to product liability; personal injury; the use and
performance of our products; warranty matters; patent, trademark or other intellectual property infringement; contractual liability; the conduct of our business; tax reporting in foreign
jurisdictions; distributor termination; workplace safety; and environmental matters. We also have been identified as a potentially responsible party at multiple waste disposal sites under U.S. federal
and related state environmental statutes and regulations and may have joint and several liability for any investigation and remediation costs incurred with respect to such sites. We have denied
liability with respect to many of these lawsuits, claims and proceedings and are vigorously defending such lawsuits, claims and proceedings. We carry various forms of commercial, property and
casualty, product liability and other forms of insurance; however, such insurance may not be applicable or adequate to cover the costs associated with a judgment against us with respect to these
lawsuits, claims and proceedings. We do not believe that these lawsuits are material individually or in the aggregate. While we believe we have also established adequate accruals for our expected
future liability with respect to pending lawsuits, claims and proceedings, where the nature and extent of any such liability can be reasonably estimated based upon then presently available
information, there can be no assurance that the final resolution of any existing or future lawsuits, claims or proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition or cash flows.

We
conduct significant business operations in Brazil that are subject to the Brazilian federal, state and local labor, social security, tax and customs laws. While we believe we comply
with such laws, they are complex, subject to varying interpretations and we are often engaged in litigation regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances. In 2010, it was
determined that we overpaid a Brazilian revenue based tax during the period 2004-2008. Our results include a pre-tax recovery of $32 million recorded in cost of sales
($21 million after-tax) related to tax credits on imported products arising from an overpayment. This recovery has been excluded from segment results as it was not considered by
management in its evaluation of operating results for the year.

In
June 2008, four of our sites in Southern Indiana, including our Technical Center, experienced extensive flood damage. We have submitted a claim for $220 million to our
insurance carriers, which includes a claim for business interruption. As of December 31, 2010, we have received $92 million in
recoveries from the insurance carriers. Our insurance carriers have disputed certain aspects of our claim and the parties have filed suit against each other. Although we believe that we are insured
against the full amount of our claim, there is no assurance that we will be successful recovering the amounts we believe are due under the policies.



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)

U.S. Distributor Commitments

Our distribution agreements with independent and partially-owned distributors generally have a three-year term and are
restricted to specified territories. Our distributors develop and maintain a network of dealers with which we have no direct relationship. The distributors are permitted to sell other, noncompetitive
products only with our consent. We license all of our distributors to use our name and logo in connection with the sale and service of our products, with no right to assign or sublicense the
trademarks, except to authorized dealers, without our consent. Products are sold to the distributors at standard domestic or international distributor net prices, as applicable. Net prices are
wholesale prices we establish to permit our distributors an adequate margin on their sales. Subject to local laws, we can generally refuse to renew these agreements upon expiration or terminate them
upon written notice for inadequate sales, change in principal ownership and certain other reasons. Distributors also have the right to terminate the agreements upon 60-day notice without
cause, or 30-day notice for cause. Upon termination or failure to renew, we are required to purchase the distributor's current inventory, signage and special tools, and may, at our option
purchase other assets of the distributor, but are under no obligation to do so.

Residual Value Guarantees

We have various residual value guarantees on equipment leased under operating leases. The total amount of these residual value
guarantees at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $2 million and $8 million, respectively.

Other Guarantees and Commitments

In addition to the guarantees discussed above, from time to time we enter into other guarantee arrangements, including guarantees of
non-U.S. distributor financing and other miscellaneous guarantees of third-party obligations. As of December 31, 2010, the maximum potential loss related to these other guarantees
is $76 million ($47 million of which relates to the Beijing Foton guarantee discussed below and $28 million relates to the Cummins Olayan Energy Limited guarantee discussed
below).

We
have arrangements with certain suppliers that require us to purchase minimum volumes or be subject to monetary penalties. The penalty amounts are less than our purchase commitments
and essentially allow the supplier to recover their tooling costs in most instances. As of December 31, 2010, if we were to stop purchasing from each of these suppliers, the amount of the
penalty would be approximately $59 million, of which $53 million relates to a contract with an engine parts supplier that extends to 2013. This arrangement enables us to secure critical
components. We do not currently anticipate paying any penalties under these contracts.

In
July 2008, Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Company, a 50 percent owned entity accounted for under the equity method, entered into a line of credit agreement with a borrowing
capacity of up to $181 million (at current exchange rates). The line will be used primarily to fund equipment purchases for a new manufacturing plant. As a part of this transaction, we
guaranteed 50 percent of any outstanding borrowings up to a maximum guarantee of $91 million (at current exchange rates). As of December 31, 2010, outstanding borrowings under
this agreement were $93 million and our guarantee was $47 million (at current exchange rates). We recorded a liability for the fair value of this guarantee.



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)

The
amount of the liability was less than $1 million. The offset to this liability was an increase in our investment in the joint venture.

In
February 2010, Cummins Olayan Energy Limited, a 49 percent owned entity accounted for under the equity method, executed a four-year $101 million (at current
exchange rates) debt financing arrangement to acquire certain rental equipment assets. As a part of this transaction, we guaranteed 49 percent of the total outstanding loan amount or
$50 million (at current exchange rates). As of December 31, 2010, outstanding borrowings under this agreement were $56 million and our guarantee was $28 million (at current
exchange rates). We recorded a liability for the fair value of this guarantee. The amount of the liability was less than $1 million. The offset to this liability was an increase in our
investment in the joint venture.

We
have guarantees with certain customers that require us to satisfactorily honor contractual or regulatory obligations, or compensate for monetary losses related to nonperformance.
These performance bonds and other performance-related guarantees were $78 million and $75 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Indemnifications

Periodically, we enter into various contractual arrangements where we agree to indemnify a third-party against certain types of losses.
Common types of indemnifications include:

•

product liability and license, patent or trademark indemnifications,

•

asset sale agreements where we agree to indemnify the purchaser against future environmental exposures related to the
asset sold and

•

any contractual agreement where we agree to indemnify the counter-party for losses suffered as a result of a
misrepresentation in the contract.

We
regularly evaluate the probability of having to incur costs associated with these indemnifications and accrue for expected losses that are probable. Because the indemnifications are
not related to specified known liabilities and due to their uncertain nature, we are unable to estimate the maximum amount of the potential loss associated with these indemnifications.

Joint Venture Commitments

As of December 31, 2010, we have committed to invest an additional $96 million into existing joint ventures with
$73 million to be funded in 2011.

Leases

We lease certain manufacturing equipment, facilities, warehouses, office space and equipment, aircraft and automobiles for varying
periods under lease agreements. Most of the leases are non-cancelable operating leases with fixed rental payments, expire over the next ten years and contain renewal provisions. Rent
expense under these leases approximated:

Sale and Leaseback Transaction Amendment and Extension

During 2001, we entered into a sale-leaseback transaction with a financial institution with regard to certain
heavy-duty engine manufacturing equipment. The lease was classified as an operating lease with a lease term of 11.5 years, expiring June 28, 2013. The financial institution
created a grantor trust to act as the lessor in the arrangement. The financial institution owns all of the equity in the trust. The grantor trust has no assets other than the equipment and its rights
to the lease agreement with us. The terms of the agreement contained a guarantee of the residual value of the equipment and in December 2003, the grantor trust which acts as the lessor in the sale and
leaseback transaction described above was consolidated as a result of the adoption of new accounting standards for variable interest entities, due primarily to the existence of the residual value
guarantee.

In
February 2009, we amended the lease agreement to extend the lease for an additional two years to June 2015 and we removed the residual value guarantee. As a result of removing the
residual value

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

guarantee,
we were no longer required to consolidate the grantor trust and we deconsolidated the trust in the first quarter of 2009. With the deconsolidation, we are now required to account for the
leasing arrangement with the trust which qualifies as a capital lease. The deconsolidation of the trust had minimal impact on our

Statements

as the present value of the minimum lease payments (including the extension) approximated the amount that was reported as noncontrolling interest as of the date of
the amendment. The reduction in noncontrolling interests and increase in our capital lease liabilities was $35 million.

Employee Benefits Trust

In 1997, we established the Employee Benefits Trust (EBT) funded with common stock for use in meeting our future obligations under
employee benefit and compensation plans. The primary sources of cash for the EBT are dividends received on unallocated shares of our common stock held by the EBT. The EBT may be used to fund matching
contributions to employee accounts in the 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) made in proportion to employee contributions under the terms of the RSP. In

Employee Stock Ownership Plan

We have an ESOP Trust that was established in 1989 for certain domestic salaried and non-bargained employees participating
in our RSP. The ESOP had a note payable to us which was funded through future employer contributions to the ESOP Trust. In 2010, the debt was repaid and the ESOP became an unleveraged plan.

Our
annual cash contributions during plan year 2010, 2009 and 2008 along with dividends received on unallocated shares of our common stock held by the ESOP Trust and cash contributions
from the EBT were equal to the required principal and interest payments due under the ESOP notes. Dividends
received on allocated ESOP shares were used to purchase shares of our common stock from the EBT. Those shares were allocated to the participant accounts. Compensation expense was recorded as shares
were allocated to plan participants each year and reduced by the common stock dividends received by the ESOP Trust. Unearned compensation was included in Cummins Inc. shareholders' equity and
represented compensation expense which was recorded as the remaining shares were allocated to participants. All shares issued to the ESOP Trust were considered outstanding for purposes of computing
earnings per share. Dividends on unallocated ESOP shares were used to service a portion of the principal and interest due on the ESOP notes.

under the plan include, but are not limited to, stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, restricted stock and other stock awards.

Stock
options are generally granted with a strike price equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant, a life of 10 years and a two-year vesting
period. Compensation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the vesting period beginning on the grant date. The compensation expense is based on the fair value of each option
grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Options granted to employees eligible for retirement under our retirement plan are fully expensed as of the grant date.

Stock
options are also awarded through the Key Employee Stock Investment Plan (KESIP) which allows certain employees, other than officers, to purchase shares of common stock on an
installment basis up to an established credit limit. Fifty stock options are granted for every even block of 100 KESIP shares purchased by the employee. The options granted through the KESIP program
are considered awards under The Plan and are vested immediately. Compensation expense for stock options granted through the KESIP program is recorded based on the fair value of each option grant using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

Performance
shares are granted as target awards and are earned based on our return on equity (ROE) performance. A payout factor has been established ranging from zero to
200 percent of the target award based on the actual ROE performance during the two-year period. Any shares earned are then restricted for one additional year. Employees leaving the
company prior to the end of the restriction period forfeit their shares. Compensation expense is recorded ratably over the period beginning on the grant date until the shares become unrestricted and
is based on the amount of the award that is expected to be earned under the plan formula, adjusted each reporting period based on current information.

Restricted
common stock is awarded from time to time at no cost to certain employees. Participants are entitled to cash dividends and voting rights. Restrictions limit the sale or
transfer of the shares during a defined period. Generally, one-third of the shares are released after two years and one-third of the shares issued are released each year
thereafter on the anniversary of the grant date, provided the participant remains an employee. Compensation expense is determined at the grant date and is recognized over the four-year
restriction period on a straight-line basis.

Compensation
expense (net of estimated forfeitures) related to our share-based plans for the year ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was approximately $20 million,
$20 million and $28 million, respectively. The excess tax benefit/(deficiency) associated with our share-based plans for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, was
$10 million, $(1) million and $13 million, respectively. The total unrecognized compensation expense (net of estimated forfeitures) related to nonvested awards was approximately
$26 million at December 31, 2010, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of less than two years.

We calculate basic earnings per share (EPS) of common stock by dividing net income attributable to Cummins Inc. by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the

NOTE 19. DERIVATIVES

We are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. This risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of
financial derivative instruments including foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swap contracts and interest rate swaps. As stated in our policies and procedures, financial derivatives are
used expressly for hedging purposes, and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes. When material,



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 19. DERIVATIVES (Continued)

we
adjust the value of our derivative contracts for counter-party or our credit risk. The results and status of our hedging transactions are reported to senior management on a monthly and quarterly
basis.

Foreign Exchange Rates

As a result of our international business presence, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks. We transact business in foreign
currencies and, as a result, our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. To help manage our exposure to exchange rate volatility, we use foreign
exchange forward contracts on a regular basis to hedge forecasted intercompany and third-party sales and purchases denominated in non-functional currencies. Our internal policy allows for
managing anticipated foreign currency cash flows for up to one year. These foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges under GAAP. The effective
portion of the unrealized gain or loss on the forward contract is deferred and reported as a component of "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" (AOCL). When the hedged forecasted transaction (sale or
purchase) occurs, the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction
affects income. The ineffective portion of the hedge, unrealized gain or loss, if any, is recognized in current income during the period of change. As of December 31, 2010, the amount we expect
to reclassify from AOCL to income over the next year is a net unrealized loss of $1 million. For the years ended December 31, 2010
and 2009, there were no circumstances that would have resulted in the discontinuance of a foreign currency cash flow hedge.

To
minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, we enter into foreign
currency forward contracts, which are considered economic hedges. The objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward
contract. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under GAAP.

The
table below summarizes our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts. Only the U.S. dollar forward contracts are designated and qualify for hedge accounting as of each period
presented below. The currencies in this table represent 97 percent and 96 percent of the notional amounts of contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2010 and December 31,

NOTE 19. DERIVATIVES (Continued)

Commodity Price Risk

We are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers. In order to protect
ourselves against future price volatility and, consequently, fluctuations in gross margins, we periodically enter into commodity swap contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw
material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations. The swap contracts are derivative contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges
under GAAP. The effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss is deferred and reported as a component of AOCL. When the hedged forecasted transaction (purchase) occurs, the unrealized gain or loss
is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income. The ineffective portion of
the hedge, if any, is recognized in current income in the period in which the ineffectiveness occurs. As of December 31, 2010, we expect to reclassify an unrealized net gain of
$15 million from AOCL to income over the next year. For the year ended December 31, 2010, there were no material circumstances that would have resulted in the discontinuance of a cash
flow hedge. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we discontinued hedge accounting on certain contracts where the forecasted transactions were no longer probable. The amount reclassified to
income as a result of this action was a loss of $4 million. Our internal policy allows for managing these cash flow hedges for up to three years.

following table summarizes our outstanding commodity swap contracts that were entered into to hedge the cost of certain raw material purchases:

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. We manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use
of interest rate swaps. The objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk.

In
November 2005, we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert our $250 million debt issue, due in 2028, from a fixed rate of 7.125% to a floating rate based on a
LIBOR spread. The terms of the swap mirror those of the debt, with interest paid semi-annually. This swap qualifies as a fair value hedge under GAAP. The gain or loss on this derivative
instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current income as

NOTE 21. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

On January 4, 2010, we acquired the remaining 70 percent interest in Cummins Western Canada (CWC) from our former principal for consideration of approximately
$71 million. We formed a new partnership with a new distributor principal where we own 80 percent of CWC and the new distributor principal owns 20 percent. As of the acquisition
date CWC ceased being a variable interest entity. The acquisition was effective on January 1, 2010. The $71 million of consideration consisted of:

The
purchase price was approximately $97 million as presented below. The intangible assets are primarily customer related and are being amortized over periods ranging from one to
three years. The acquisition of CWC was accounted for as a business combination, with the results of the acquired entity and the goodwill included in the Distribution operating segment as of the
acquisition date. Distribution segment results also include a $12 million gain for the three months ended March 28, 2010, as we were required to re-measure our
pre-existing 30 percent ownership interest in CWC to fair value in accordance with GAAP. Net sales for CWC were $272 million for the twelve months ended December 31,
2010, which was approximately two percent of Cummins Inc. consolidated sales.

noncontrolling interest (representing our partner's 20 percent interest) which was completely offset by the $8 million receivable from our partner, reducing the noncontrolling interest
impact to zero as of the acquisition date. The interest-bearing loan is expected to be repaid over a period of 3-5 years. The partner also has periodic options to purchase an
additional 10 to 15 percent interest in CWC up to a maximum of an additional 30 percent (total ownership not to exceed 50 percent).

NOTE 21. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES (Continued)

In November 2010, we purchased a majority interest in a previously independent North American distributorship. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting
and resulted in an aggregate purchase price of $27 million. The assets of the acquired business were primarily accounts receivable, inventory, and fixed assets. The transaction generated
$1 million of goodwill.

In
July 2008, we entered into a transaction with two Fiat group companies to (1) sell our one-third interest in the European Engine Alliance (EEA) joint venture and
simultaneously (2) purchase the remaining 50 percent interest in Consolidated Diesel Corporation (CDC). As a result, we now own 100 percent of CDC and no longer have an ownership
interest in EEA. CDC was previously included in our consolidated results as we were considered the primary beneficiary under GAAP. We sold our remaining interest in EEA for $64 million and
subsequently purchased the remaining interest in CDC for $61 million, however, because the transactions were entered into simultaneously with the same counterparty, it is considered a
non-monetary exchange for accounting purposes. Thus, we accounted for the transactions at fair value in accordance with GAAP for exchanges of nonmonetary assets. Because fair value and
book value were reasonably close, there was no material gain or loss recorded on the sale of EEA. In addition, there were no significant adjustments from book value for any assets or liabilities of
CDC recorded upon the acquisition of the remaining 50 percent interest.

During
2008, we purchased a majority interest in three previously independent North American distributors in order to increase our ownership interests in key portions of the distribution
channel. The acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and resulted in an aggregate purchase price of $81 million which we funded with $54 million of
borrowings and $27 million of cash. The assets of the acquired businesses were primarily accounts receivable, inventory and fixed assets. There was less than $1 million of goodwill
generated from these transactions.

NOTE 22. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES

2009 Restructuring Actions

In 2009, we executed restructuring actions in response to a reduction in orders in most of our U.S. and foreign markets due to the
deterioration in the global economy. We reduced our global workforce by approximately 1,000 professional employees. In addition, we took
numerous employee actions at many of our manufacturing locations, including approximately 3,200 hourly employees, significant downsizing at numerous facilities and complete closure of several
facilities and branch distributor locations. Employee termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified
positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans, union contracts or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan. Estimates of
restructuring costs were made based on information available at the time charges were recorded. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved, actual amounts paid for such activities may differ from
amounts initially recorded.

In
response to closures and downsizing noted above, we incurred $2 million of restructuring expenses for lease terminations and $5 million of restructuring expenses for
asset impairments. During 2009, we recorded a total pre-tax restructuring charge of $85 million, comprising $90 million of charges related to 2009 actions net of the
$3 million favorable change in estimate related to 2008 actions and

2008 Restructuring Actions

We executed restructuring actions primarily in the form of voluntary and involuntary separation programs in the fourth quarter of 2008.
These actions were in response to the continued deterioration in our U.S. businesses and most key markets around the world in the second half of 2008, as well as a reduction in orders in most U.S. and
global markets for 2009. We reduced our worldwide professional workforce by approximately 650 employees, or 4.5 percent. We offered a voluntary retirement package to certain active professional
employees in the U.S. based on a clearly defined set of criteria. We also took voluntary and involuntary actions which included approximately 800 hourly employees, the majority of which
received severance benefits. The compensation packages contained salary and continuation of benefits, including health care, life insurance and outplacement services. The voluntary retirement package
was accepted by approximately 150 employees. The remaining professional reductions of 500 employees were involuntary. The expenses recorded during the year ended December 31, 2008, included
severance costs related to both voluntary and involuntary terminations. During 2008, we incurred a pre-tax charge related to the professional and hourly restructuring initiatives of
approximately $37 million.

Employee
termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated, benefits
to be paid under existing severance plans or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of
the plan. At December 31, 2008, of the approximately 1,450 employees affected by this plan, 1,250 had been terminated. All terminations were substantially complete as of December 31,
2009.

NOTE 23. SALES OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

In January 2004, we entered into a three-year facility agreement with a financial institution to sell a designated pool of trade receivables to Cummins Trade
Receivables, LLC (CTR), a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary. In July 2007, we amended the agreement to extend the facility
until July 2010, and raised the purchase limitation from $200 million to $400 million. To maintain a balance in the designated pools of receivables sold, we sold new receivables to CTR
as existing receivables were collected. Receivables sold to CTR in which an interest was not transferred to the financial institution are included in "Receivables, net" on our

Consolidated Balance Sheets

.

In
April 2010, we terminated our existing trade receivables facility and entered into a new 364-day agreement (subject to renewal) with a financial institution to sell trade
receivables from time to time to Cummins Trade Receivables, LLC (CTR), a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary, for the purpose of obtaining credit secured by such receivables from one or
more commercial paper conduit and committed institutional lenders. To support outstanding advances under the agreement, we sell new receivables to CTR as they arise. Receivables sold to CTR are
included in "Receivables, net" on our

Consolidated Balance Sheets

. The amount of aggregate advances that can be outstanding under the agreement at any
point in time is limited to the lesser of $250 million or, with certain adjustments, the amount of eligible receivables held by CTR. There are no provisions in the agreement that require us to
maintain a minimum investment credit rating; however, the terms of the agreement contain the same



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 23. SALES OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (Continued)

financial
covenants as our revolving credit facility. In accordance with FASB Standards for transfer of financial assets, any activity under our receivable sales program will be accounted for as
secured borrowings. As of December 31, 2010, the amount available under the agreement was $122 million and no advances were outstanding under the agreement.

CTR
is a separate legal entity from Cummins and each of its affiliates and its assets and credit are not available to satisfy the debts and obligations of Cummins or any other entity.
CTR's assets are listed separately on its balance sheet on a stand-alone basis. CTR's assets will be available first and foremost to satisfy claims of its creditors.

No
accounts receivable sold to CTR were written off during 2010, 2009 or 2008. The sold receivables servicing portfolio, which is included in receivables and the proceeds from the sale
of receivables and other related cash flows are as follows:

NOTE 24. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

The FASB amended the standards related to the consolidation of variable interest entities, which was effective for us on January 1, 2010. The new standard requires us to analyze
whether our variable interests give us a controlling financial interest of a variable interest entity and outlines what defines a primary beneficiary. The only significant impact of the adoption of
this standard was to deconsolidate CKEC as of January 1, 2010 and to account for CKEC under GAAP for equity method investees. See Note 1, "SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES,"
for additional information. We consolidate certain VIEs if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary in accordance with the revised standard. We have variable interests in certain businesses
accounted for under the equity method of accounting that are deemed VIEs and are subject to the provisions of GAAP for variable interest entities.

We
have variable interests in two manufacturing entities that are deemed to be VIEs. In both cases, the entities are deemed to be VIEs because the variability in the results of the
business are absorbed primarily through the product pricing arrangements as opposed to through the equity interests. In both cases, we concluded we were not the primary beneficiary as both entities
are 50/50 joint ventures and all significant aspects of the entities are jointly controlled. We have not provided any loans or guarantees to either entity. Our maximum exposure to losses related to
these entities is limited to our ownership interest which was $79 million at December 31, 2010.



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 24. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (Continued)

We also have variable interests in a North American distributor that was deemed to be a VIE because ownership and profits are split differently due to a non-voting economic
interest held by certain key employees. Our ownership percentage in this entity is 36 percent. We were not deemed to be the primary beneficiary as our equity ownership represents our only
variable interest in the entity and we do not otherwise control the significant activities of the entity. The principal business of the distributor is to sell Cummins engines and related service parts
as well as provide repair and maintenance services on engines, including warranty repairs. We have not provided any loans or guarantees to the entity. Our maximum potential loss related to this
distributor as of December 31, 2010, consisted of our ownership interest totaling $3 million. In addition, under certain circumstances,
we could be required to repurchase certain assets of the distributor at amounts approximating fair value as more fully discussed in Note 13, "COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES".

NOTE 25. OPERATING SEGMENTS

Operating segments under GAAP are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating
decision-maker, or
decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Cummins chief operating decision-maker (CODM) is the Chief Executive Officer.

Our
reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Power Generation, Components and Distribution. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and
markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers
in on-highway and various industrial markets. The engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well as various industrial applications including
construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military. The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines, generator sets and alternators.
The Components segment includes sales of filtration products, exhaust and aftertreatment systems, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned
distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets, and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various
original equipment manufacturers.

We
use segment EBIT (defined as earnings before interest expense, taxes and noncontrolling interests) as a primary basis for the CODM to evaluate the performance of each of our operating
segments. Segment amounts exclude certain expenses not specifically identifiable to segments.

The
accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those applied in our

Consolidated Financial Statements

. We prepared the
financial results of our operating segments on a



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 25. OPERATING SEGMENTS (Continued)

basis
that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We have allocated certain common costs and
expenses, primarily corporate functions, among segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These include certain costs and expenses of
shared services, such as information technology, human resources, legal and finance. We also do not allocate debt-related items, actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits,
changes in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance, restructuring and other charges, flood damage gains or losses or income taxes to individual segments. In the third quarter of 2010,
non-segment items also included a Brazil revenue tax recovery that was not allocated to the businesses as it was not considered by management in its evaluation of operating results for the
year. Segment EBIT may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.

NOTE 26. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

In January 2011, we reached an agreement to sell certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business which manufactures exhaust products and select components for emission systems for
a variety of applications. The transaction is expected to close in our fiscal second quarter of 2011. This business has historically been included in our Components segment. The sales price is
expected to range from $120 million to $130 million, subject to a final financial statement review. There are no earnouts or other contingencies associated with the sales price. We
expect to recognize a pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately $70 million to $80 million, which includes an allocation of goodwill of approximately $15 million. Sales for this
business were $171 million, $126 million and $169 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Income before income taxes for this business was approximately $22 million,
$11 million and $19 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

In
February 2011, we signed a non-binding letter of intent to sell certain assets and liabilities of our light-duty filtration business which manufactures
light-duty automotive
and industrial filtration solutions. The transaction is expected to close in our fiscal second quarter of 2011. The sales price is expected to be approximately $70 million to
$75 million, subject to a final financial statement review. There are no earnouts or other contingencies associated with the sales price. We expect to recognize a pre-tax gain on the sale of
approximately $30 million to $35 million, which includes an allocation of goodwill of approximately $9 million. Sales for this business were $68 million, $55 million
and $73 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Income before income taxes for this business was approximately $10 million, $3 million and $8 million in 2010, 2009
and 2008, respectively.

The
assets and liabilities associated with these businesses have not been reclassified and separately presented in the

Consolidated Balance
Sheets

as they are immaterial. We will enter into supply and other agreements with the operations that will represent ongoing involvement and as such, the results of these
operations will not be presented as discontinued operations.

Earnings
per share in each quarter is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during that quarter while earnings per share for the
full year is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the year. Thus, the sum of the four quarters earnings per share does not equal the full year earnings per share.

At
December 31, 2010, there were approximately 3,831 holders of record of Cummins Inc.'s $2.50 par value common stock.
