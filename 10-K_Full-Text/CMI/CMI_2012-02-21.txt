Our
Distribution segment consists of 22 company-owned and 18 joint venture distributors that service and distribute the full range of our products and services to end-users
at approximately 400 locations in approximately 70 distribution territories. Our company-owned distributors are located in key markets, including North America, Australia, Europe, the Middle East,
India, China, Africa, Russia, Japan, Brazil and Singapore, while our joint venture distributors are located in North America, South America, Africa, China, Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam.

The
Distribution segment consists of the following businesses which service and/or distribute the full range of our products and
services:

•

Parts and filtration,

•

Power generation,

•

Engines and

•

Service.

The
Distribution segment is organized into five primary geographic regions:

•

Asia Pacific,



•

Europe and the Middle East (EME),

•

North and Central America,

•

Africa and

•

South America.

Asia
Pacific and EME are composed of six smaller regional distributor organizations (South Pacific, Greater Europe, the Middle East, China, India and Northeast/Southeast Asia) which
allow us to better manage these vast geographic territories.

North
and Central America are mostly comprised of a network of partially-owned distributors. Internationally, our network consists of independent, partially-owned and wholly-owned
distributors. Through these networks, we provide parts and service to our customers. These full-service solutions include maintenance contracts, engineering services and integrated
products, where we customize our products to cater to specific needs of end-users. Our distributors also serve and develop dealers, predominantly OEM dealers, in their territories by
providing new products, technical support, tools, training, parts and product information.

In
addition to managing our involvement with our wholly-owned and partially-owned distributors, our Distribution segment is responsible for managing the performance and capabilities of
our independent distributors. Our Distribution segment serves a highly diverse customer base with approximately 47 percent of its 2011 sales being generated from new engines and power
generation equipment, compared to 42 percent in 2010, with its remaining sales generated by parts and service revenue.

Financial
information about our distributors accounted for under the equity method are incorporated by reference from Note 3, "INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INVESTEES," to our

Consolidated Financial Statements

.

In
November 2010, we purchased a majority interest in a previously independent North American distributorship. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting
and resulted in an aggregate purchase price of $27 million. The assets of the acquired business were primarily accounts receivable, inventory, and fixed assets. The transaction generated
$1 million of goodwill.

On
January 4, 2010, we acquired the remaining 70 percent interest in Cummins Western Canada (CWC) from our former principal for consideration of approximately
$71 million in order to increase our ownership interests in key portions of the distribution channel. We formed a new partnership with a new distributor principal in which we own
80 percent of CWC and the new distributor principal owns 20 percent. The acquisition, which was effective on January 1, 2010, was accounted for as a business combination and
resulted in $2 million of goodwill. The results of the acquired entity for 2011 and 2010 were included in the Distribution operating segment. The assets of the acquired business were primarily
inventory, fixed assets and accounts receivable. See Note 2, "DIVESTITURES AND ACQUISITIONS," to our

Consolidated Financial Statements

for
additional detail.

Our
distributors compete with distributors or dealers that offer similar products. In many cases, these competing distributors or dealers are owned by, or affiliated with the companies
that are listed above as competitors of our Engine, Components or Power Generation segments. These competitors vary by geographical location.

JOINT VENTURES, ALLIANCES AND NON-WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES

We have entered into a number of joint venture agreements and alliances with business partners around the world. Our joint ventures are
either distribution or manufacturing entities. We also own



controlling
interests in non-wholly-owned manufacturing and distribution subsidiaries. Three entities, in which we own more than a 50 percent equity interest, are consolidated in
our Distribution segment results as well as several manufacturing joint ventures in the other operating segments.

In
the event of a change of control of either party to certain of these joint ventures and other strategic alliances, certain consequences may result including automatic termination and
liquidation of the venture, exercise of "put" or "call" rights of ownership by the non-acquired partner, termination or transfer of technology license rights to the
non-acquired partner and increases in component transfer prices to the acquired partner. We will continue to evaluate joint venture and partnership opportunities in order to penetrate new
markets, develop new products and generate manufacturing and operational efficiencies.

Financial
information about our investments in joint ventures and alliances is incorporated by reference from Note 3, "INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INVESTEES," to the

Consolidated Financial Statements.

ISF 3.8 liter families of Cummins high performance light-duty diesel engines in Beijing. These engines are used in light-duty commercial trucks, pickup trucks,
multipurpose and sport utility vehicles. Certain types of marine, small construction equipment and industrial applications are also served by these engine families.

Non-Wholly-Owned Manufacturing Subsidiary

We have a controlling interest in Cummins India Ltd. (CIL), which is a publicly listed company on various stock exchanges in
India. CIL produces mid-range, heavy-duty and high-horsepower engines, as well as generators for the Indian and export markets. CIL also produces compressed natural
gas spark-ignited engines licensed from another of our joint ventures. CIL's net income attributable to Cummins was $44 million, $46 million and $28 million for
2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

SUPPLY

We source our materials and manufactured components from leading suppliers both domestically and internationally. We machine and
assemble some of the components
used in our engines and power generation units, including blocks, heads, turbochargers, connecting rods, camshafts, crankshafts, filters, exhaust systems, alternators and fuel systems. We single
source approximately 60 to 70 percent of the



total
types of parts in our product designs. We have long-term agreements with critical suppliers to help assure our capacity, delivery and quality requirements including one "take or pay"
contract with an emission solutions business supplier requiring us to purchase approximately $73 million annually from 2012 through 2018. Although we elect to source a relatively high
proportion of our total raw materials and component requirements from sole suppliers, we have established a process to annually review our sourcing strategies with a focus on the reduction of risk,
which has led us to dual source critical components, where possible, and establish programs to proactively detect suppliers with potential risks. We are also developing suppliers in many global or
emerging markets to serve our businesses across the globe and provide alternative sources in the event of disruption from existing suppliers.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

We own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture. These patents and trademarks
were granted and registered over a period of years. Although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations, we do not believe any patent, group of patents, or
trademark (other than our leading brand house trademarks) is significant to our business.

SEASONALITY

While individual product lines may experience modest seasonal declines in production, there is no material effect on the demand for the
majority of our products on a quarterly basis with the exception that our Power Generation segment normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter due to general declines in construction
spending during this period and our Distribution segment normally experiences seasonal declines in its first quarter business activity due to holiday periods in Asia and Australia.

LARGEST CUSTOMERS

We have thousands of customers around the world and have developed long-standing business relationships with many of them.
PACCAR is our largest customer, accounting for approximately 12 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2011, compared to approximately seven percent in 2010 and nine percent in 2009. We have
long-term supply agreements with PACCAR for our heavy-duty ISX 15 liter and ISX 11.9 liter engines and our ISL 9 liter mid-range engine. While a
significant number of our sales to PACCAR are under long-term supply agreements, these agreements provide for particular engine requirements for specific vehicle models and not a specific
volume of engines. PACCAR is our only customer accounting for more than ten percent of our net sales in 2011. The loss of this customer or a significant decline in the production level of PACCAR
vehicles that use our engines would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We have been an engine supplier to PACCAR for over 67 years. A summary of
principal customers for each operating segment is included in our segment discussion.

In
addition to our agreement with PACCAR, we have long-term heavy-duty engine supply agreements with Volvo Trucks North America and long-term
mid-range supply agreements with Daimler Trucks North America, Ford and MAN. We also have an agreement with Chrysler for supplying the engine for its Ram trucks. In our
off-highway markets, we have various engine and component supply agreements ranging across our midrange and high-horsepower businesses with Komatsu Ltd., as well as
various joint ventures and other license agreements in our Engine, Component and Distribution segments. Collectively, our net sales to these seven customers, including PACCAR, was approximately
31 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2011, compared to approximately 25 percent in 2010 and 23 percent in 2009. Excluding PACCAR, net sales to individual customers were
less than six percent of our consolidated net sales to any single customer in 2011, compared to less than four percent in 2010 and 2009. These agreements contain standard purchase and



sale
agreement terms covering engine and engine parts pricing, quality and delivery commitments, as well as engineering product support obligations. The basic nature of our agreements with OEM
customers is that they are long-term price and operations agreements that help assure the availability of our products to each customer through the duration of the respective agreements.
Agreements with most OEMs contain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach, change of control or insolvency or bankruptcy of
the other party.

BACKLOG

Our 2011 lead times for the majority of our businesses remained consistent or improved from their 2010 levels. While we have supply
agreements with some truck and off-highway equipment OEMs, most of our business is transacted through open purchase orders. These open orders are historically subject to
month-to-month releases and are subject to cancellation on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE

Our research and development program is focused on product improvements, innovations and cost reductions for our customers. Research
and development expenditures include salaries, contractor fees, building costs, utilities, administrative expenses and allocation of corporate costs and are expensed, net of contract reimbursements,
when incurred. Research and development expenses, net of contract reimbursements, were $621 million in 2011, $402 million in 2010 and $362 million in 2009. Contract reimbursements
were $75 million in 2011, $68 million in 2010 and $92 million in 2009.

For
2011, 2010 and 2009, approximately $1 million, $38 million and $151 million or less than one percent, nine percent and 42 percent respectively, of our
research and development expenditures were directly related to compliance with 2010 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emission standards. For 2011 and 2010, approximately $104 million and
$36 million or 17 percent and nine percent, of our research and development expenditures were directly related to compliance with 2013 EPA emission standards. In 2011, we increased our
research, development and engineering expenses as we continued to invest in future critical technologies and products. We will continue to make investments to improve our current technologies,
continue to meet the future emission requirements around the world and improve fuel economy.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

Sustainability

We continue to be a leader in sustainable business development and practices. We have invested significantly to further lower emissions
from and increase the efficiency of our products. Our ten climate change principles direct our actions to address this environmental challenge across our products, businesses, employees and
communities. We have worked collaboratively with customers to improve their fuel economy and reduce their carbon footprint. We have significantly reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from our
facilities and exceeded our 2010 goal of 25 percent intensity reduction by achieving a 28 percent reduction, resulting in a savings of approximately $20 million annually. We will
continue these efforts through our new facility goal to expand this reduction to 40 percent GHG intensity reduction by 2015. Over the past three years, we have reduced water usage by
22 percent, reduced hazardous waste produced during manufacturing by 26 percent and landfill waste by 11 percent, normalized to employee hours. We have articulated our positions
on key public policy issues surrounding a wide range of environmental issues and were actively engaged in developing the first-ever GHG and fuel efficiency standards for commercial
vehicles that were finalized in the U.S. in 2010. For the seventh consecutive year, we were named to the Dow Jones World Sustainability Index, which recognizes the top 10 percent of the world's
largest 2,500 companies in economic,



environmental
and social leadership. Our sustainability report for 2010/2011 as well as a supplement of more detailed environmental data is available on our website at www.cummins.com.

Product Environmental Compliance

Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing
emission and noise. Our products comply with all current emission standards that the EPA, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and other state and international regulatory agencies have
established for heavy-duty on-highway diesel and gas engines and off-highway engines. Our ability to comply with these and future emission standards is an essential
element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets. We have made, and will continue to make, significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards. Our failure
to comply with these standards could result in adverse effects on our future financial results.

EPA Engine Certifications

The current on-highway emission standards came into effect in the U.S. on January 1, 2010. To meet the 2010 U.S. EPA
heavy-duty on-highway emission standards, we used an evolution of our proven 2007 technology solution to maintain power and torque with substantial fuel economy improvement and
maintenance intervals comparable with our 2007 compliant engines. We offer a complete lineup of on-highway engines to meet the near-zero emission standards.
Mid-range and heavy-duty engines for EPA 2010 require NOx aftertreatment. NOx reduction is achieved by an integrated technology solution comprised of the XPI High Pressure
Common Rail fuel system, Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) technology, next-generation cooled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), advanced electronic controls, proven air handling and the
Cummins Particulate Filter. For model year 2011 we made changes to the engine control module in response to EPA's and CARB's evolving SCR guidance. The EPA and CARB have certified that our engines
meet the 2011 emission requirements. Emission standards in international markets, including Europe, Japan, Mexico, Australia, Brazil, India and China are becoming more stringent. We believe that our
experience in meeting U.S. emission standards leaves us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emission control capability grows.

Federal
and California regulations require manufacturers to report failures of emission-related components to the EPA and CARB when the failure rate reaches a specified level. At higher
failure rates, a product recall may be required. In 2011, we submitted five reports to the EPA relating to software corrections in our engine control module. These software corrections related to the
engine control module necessitated the campaigns of approximately 1,250 engines at a cost of less than $1 million.

Other Environmental Statutes and Regulations

Expenditures for environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the U.S. have not been a
substantial portion of our annual capital outlays and are not expected to be material in 2012. Except as follows, we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations
applicable to our plants and operations.

In
the U.S., pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies and/or defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions, we have been identified as a potentially
responsible party (PRP) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended or similar state laws, at approximately 20 waste disposal sites. Based upon
our experiences at similar sites we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be significant. We have
established accruals that we believe are adequate for our expected future liability with respect to these sites.



In
addition, we have two other sites where we are working with governmental authorities on remediation projects. The costs for these remediation projects are not expected to be material.

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2011, we employed approximately 43,900 persons worldwide. Approximately 15,700 of our employees worldwide are
represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2012 and 2015.

ITEM 1A.    Risk Factors

Set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are some of the principal risks and uncertainties
that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this Report and could individually, or in combination, have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. These risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this Report,
including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Our separate section above, "CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING
FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION," should be considered in addition to the following statements.

Another sustained slowdown or significant downturn in our markets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows again.

Although emerging markets, notably China, India and Brazil, experienced strong growth and certain domestic markets showed more robust
recoveries in 2011, the global economy remains fragile. Growth rates in certain emerging markets, including China and India, began to slow in the second half of 2011 as governments looked to control
inflation through tight monetary policies, while in the developed economies, particularly in Europe, the recovery remains sluggish due to the unwinding of fiscal stimuli, lingering high unemployment,
concerns over European sovereign debt issues and the tightening of government budgets. As a result, further disruptions in Europe or in other economies could affect our revenues or liquidity.
Continued inflationary pressures in emerging market countries could cause their governments to further tighten credit and raise interest rates, resulting in slowing economic growth. If the global
economy, or some of our significant markets, were to undergo a sustained slowdown or another significant downturn, depending upon the length, duration and severity of such a slowdown or downturn, our
results of operations, financial condition and cash flow would almost certainly be materially adversely affected again. Specifically, our revenues would likely decrease, we may be forced to consider
further restructuring actions, we may need to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, our days sales outstanding may increase and we could experience impairments to assets of certain of our
businesses.

A slowdown in infrastructure development could adversely affect our business.

Infrastructure development has been a significant driver of our business in recent years. Some governments and financial institutions
have tightened credit availability and made the terms of available credit more onerous, which may lead to a slowdown in economic growth and infrastructure spending. Concern over inflationary or other
economic pressures may cause governments or financial institutions to take similar measures in the future. General weakness in economic growth or the perception that infrastructure has been overbuilt
also may lead to a decrease in infrastructure spending. Any significant declines in infrastructure development that result from these circumstances could adversely affect our business.

Unpredictability in the adoption, implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards could adversely affect our business.

Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emission and noise, including standards imposed by
the EPA, the European Union, state regulatory agencies (such as the CARB) and other regulatory agencies around the world. We have made, and will be required to continue to make, significant capital
and research expenditures to comply with these emission standards. Developing engines to meet changing government regulatory requirements, with different implementation timelines and emission
requirements, makes developing
engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in



certain
markets. In some cases, we may be required to develop new products to comply with new regulations, particularly those relating to air emission. For example, we were required to develop new
engines to comply with stringent emission standards in the U.S. by January 1, 2010, including the reduction of NOx emission to near zero levels, among other requirements. While we were able to
meet this and previous deadlines, our ability to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our position in the engine markets we serve. The
successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks, such as delays in product development, cost
over-runs and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties. In addition to these risks, the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly
stringent emission standards around the world is unpredictable and subject to change, delays and reversals that can result in new or modified products that we have developed to comply with the
standards becoming unnecessary, or becoming necessary later than expected, and in some cases negating our competitive advantage. This in turn can delay, diminish or eliminate the expected return on
capital and research expenditures that we have invested in such products and may adversely affect our perceived competitive advantage in being an early, advanced developer of compliant engines.

We rely on income from investees that we do not directly control.

Our net income includes significant equity, royalty and interest income from investees that we do not directly control. For 2011, we
recognized $ 416 million of equity, royalty and interest income from investees, compared to $ 351 million in 2010. The majority of our equity, royalty and interest income from investees
comes from our 12 unconsolidated North American distributors and from two of our joint ventures in China, Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. ("DCEC") and Chongqing Cummins Engine
Company, Ltd. ("CCEC"). Our equity ownership interests in our unconsolidated North American distributors generally range from 30 percent to 50 percent. We have 50 percent
equity ownership interests in DCEC and CCEC. As a result, although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities, we do not unilaterally control their
management or operations, which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these other entities. A significant reduction in the level of contribution by
these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our truck manufacturers and OEM customers may not continue to outsource their engine supply needs.

Several of our engine customers, including PACCAR, Volvo AB and Chrysler, are truck manufacturers or OEMs that manufacture
engines for some of their own products. Despite their own engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the
quality of our engine products, our emission capabilities, our systems integration, their customers' preferences, their desire for cost reductions, their desire for eliminating production risks and
their desire to maintain company focus. However, there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource, or outsource as much of, their engine production in the future. Increased
levels of OEM vertical integration could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers' business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer, the inability
of third-party suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. Any significant reduction in the level of engine
production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or OEM customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.



The discovery of any significant problems with our new engine platforms in North America could materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and
cash flows.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and California Air Resources Board (CARB) have certified all of our 2011
on-highway and off-highway engines, which utilize selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology to meet requisite emission levels. We introduced SCR technology into our engine platforms
in 2010. The effective performance of SCR technology and the overall performance of these engine platforms impact a number of our operating segments and remain crucial to our success in North America.
While these 2010 engine platforms have performed well in the field, the discovery of any significant problems in these platforms could result in recall campaigns, increased warranty costs,
reputational risk and brand risk.

We are subject to currency exchange rate and other related risks.

We conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to
currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, since
our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results
of operations. While we customarily enter into financial transactions that attempt to address these risks, there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect
our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in currency
exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

We
also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or
to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds
denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.

Another downturn in the North American and European automotive industries could adversely impact our business.

During the recession, lower production levels for some of our key suppliers, increases in certain raw material, commodity and energy
costs and the global credit market crisis resulted in severe financial distress among many companies within the automotive supply base. A return to financial distress within the automotive industry
and our shared supply base and/or the subsequent bankruptcy of one or more automakers may lead to further supplier bankruptcies, commercial disputes, supply chain interruptions, supplier requests for
company sponsored capital support or a collapse of the supply chain.

We are vulnerable to supply shortages from single-sourced suppliers.

During 2011, we single sourced approximately 60 to 70 percent of the total types of parts in our product designs. Any delay in
our suppliers' deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations, forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions. Delays may be caused by
factors affecting our suppliers, including capacity constraints, labor disputes, economic downturns, availability of credit, the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, suppliers'
allocations to other purchasers, weather emergencies, natural disasters or acts of war or terrorism. Any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to
our customers.



Our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs.

Our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames; however, the timing of material and
commodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions. Additionally, higher material and commodity costs around the
world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. While we customarily enter into financial transactions that attempt to address some of these risks (notably with respect to copper, platinum
and palladium), there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In addition, while the use of
commodity price hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might
result from favorable fluctuations in price. As a result, higher material and commodity costs, as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices, could result in declining
margins.

Our products are subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues.

Our products may be subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. Product recalls subject us to harm to our reputation,
loss of current and future customers, reduced revenue and product recall costs. Product recall costs are incurred when we decide, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to recall a product through a
formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue. Any significant product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We face significant competition in the markets we serve.

The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that
produce and sell similar products. We primarily compete in the market with diesel engines and related diesel products; however, new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline and other
technologies and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies. Our products primarily compete on the basis of price, performance, fuel economy, speed of delivery, quality
and customer support. We also face competitors in some emerging markets who have established local practices and long standing
relationships with participants in these markets. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets. For a more
complete discussion of the competitive environment in which each of our segments operates, see "Operating Segments" in "Item 1 Business."

Increasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers' growth.

As our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope, they are increasingly seeking to export their products to
other countries. This has meant greater demand for our advanced engine technologies to help these customers meet the more stringent emissions requirements of developed markets, as well as greater
demand for access to our distribution systems for purposes of equipment servicing. As these emerging market customers enter into and begin to compete in more developed markets, they may increasingly
begin to compete with our existing customers in these markets. Our further aid to emerging market customers could affect our relationships with developed market customers and, as a result, we may feel
pressure to restrict some of our activities in areas of competition. In addition, to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth in demand, we may see little or no benefit from
this type of expansion by our emerging market customers.



We are exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business.

Approximately 59 percent of our net sales for 2011 were attributable to customers outside the U.S., compared to
64 percent in 2010. Accordingly, our business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries. These risks
include:

•

the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;

•

trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;

•

the imposition of taxes on foreign income and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the U.S.;

•

the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions;

•

difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations;

•

required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; and

•

changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets.

As
we continue to operate our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. There can be no
assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us.

Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our
profitability.

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. Our income tax provision and cash tax liability in
the future could be adversely affected by changes in the distribution of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities,
changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. The carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are
predominantly in the U.S., is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits. These audits can involve complex issues, which may
require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes
against us. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent
tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision.

We are exposed to risks arising from the price and availability of energy.

The level of demand for our products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of energy. High energy
costs generally drive greater demand for better fuel economy in almost all countries in which we operate. Some of our engine products have been developed with a primary purpose of offering fuel
economy improvements, and if energy costs decrease or increase less than expected, demand for these products may likewise decrease. The relative unavailability of electricity in some emerging market
countries also influences demand for our electricity generating products, such as our diesel generators. If these countries add energy capacity by expanding their power grids at a rate equal to or
faster than the growth in demand for energy, the demand for our generating products could also decrease or increase less than would otherwise be the case.



We face reputational and legal risk from operations outside the U.S. and affiliations with joint venture partners.

Several of our foreign subsidiaries, affiliates and joint venture partners are located outside the U.S. with laws, rules and business
practices that differ from those of the U.S. The activities of these entities may not comply with U.S. laws or customs or our Code of Business Conduct and actions by these entities may cause us legal
or reputational risk if they violate applicable laws, rules or business practices.

We face the challenge of increasing our capacity and ramping up our production at the appropriate pace.

We experience capacity constraints and longer lead times for certain products. Accurately forecasting our expected volumes and
appropriately adjusting our capacity have been, and will continue to be, important factors in determining our results of operations. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase manufacturing
capacity to a level that meets demand for our products, which could prevent us from meeting increased customer demand and could harm our business. However, if we overestimate our demand and overbuild
our capacity, we may have significantly underutilized assets and we may experience reduced margins. If we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our business is exposed to risks of product liability claims.

We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products' failure to perform to
specification results or is alleged to result in property damage, bodily injury and/or death. We may experience material product liability losses in the future. While we maintain insurance coverage
with respect to certain product liability claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage
against product liability claims. In addition, product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time,
regardless of the ultimate outcome. An unsuccessful defense of a significant product liability claim could have a material adverse effect upon us. In addition, even if we are successful in defending
against a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us.

We may need to write off significant investments in our new North American light-duty diesel engine platform if customer commitments further deteriorate.

We began development of a North American light-duty diesel engine platform in July 2006 to be used in a variety of
on- and off-highway applications. Since that time, and as of December 31, 2011, we have capitalized investments of approximately $221 million. Market uncertainty
due to the global recession resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs, while others remain active. If customer expectations or volume projections further deteriorate
from our current expected levels and we do not identify new customers, we may need to recognize an impairment charge and write the assets down to net realizable value.

Our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations.

Our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we
operate, including laws and regulations governing air emission, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. While we believe
that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with
respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations, under either



present
laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property. If a release of hazardous substances
occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount
of such liability could be material.

Significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows.

We sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans. Our pension expense and
the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to
measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value. We could experience
increased pension expense due to a combination of factors, including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets, decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating
to the expected return on plan assets.

Significant
declines in future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets, which could result in increased pension expense in future
years and adverse changes to our financial condition. Depending upon the severity of market declines and government regulatory changes, we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the U.S.
and perhaps other countries, and these contributions could be material.

We may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters.

As of December 31, 2011, we employed approximately 43,900 persons worldwide. Approximately 15,700 of our employees worldwide are
represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2012 and 2015. While we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages or
other labor matters, there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages, or other types of
conflicts with labor unions or our employees. Any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. In addition, many of our customers
and suppliers have unionized work forces. Work stoppages or slow-downs experienced by our customers or suppliers could result in slow-downs or closures that would have a
material adverse effect on our operations.

Our financial statements are subject to changes in accounting standards that could adversely impact our profitability or financial position.

Our financial statements are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(GAAP), which are periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including
the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Recently, accounting standard setters issued new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to revenue recognition
and lease accounting as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures. The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual and
quarterly reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. An assessment of proposed standards is not provided, as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure
process and, therefore, their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed. It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current
accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on the reported results of operations and financial position.

ITEM 3.    Legal Proceedings

We are subject to numerous lawsuits and claims arising out of the ordinary course of our business, including actions related to product
liability; personal injury; the use and performance of our products; warranty matters; patent, trademark or other intellectual property infringement; contractual liability; the conduct of our
business; tax reporting in foreign jurisdictions; distributor termination; workplace safety; and environmental matters. We also have been identified as a potentially responsible party at multiple
waste disposal sites under U.S. federal and related state environmental statutes and regulations and may have joint and several liability for any investigation and remediation costs incurred with
respect to such sites. We have denied liability with respect to many of these lawsuits, claims and proceedings and are vigorously defending such lawsuits, claims and proceedings. We carry various
forms of commercial, property and casualty, product liability and other forms of insurance; however, such insurance may not be applicable or adequate to cover the costs associated with a judgment
against us with respect to these lawsuits, claims and proceedings. We do not believe that these lawsuits are material individually or in the aggregate. While we believe we have also established
adequate accruals for our expected future liability with respect to pending lawsuits, claims and proceedings, where the nature and extent of any such liability can be reasonably estimated based upon
then presently available information, there can be no assurance that the final resolution of any existing or future lawsuits, claims or proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

We
conduct significant business operations in Brazil that are subject to the Brazilian federal, state and local labor, social security, tax and customs laws. While we believe we comply
with such laws, they



are
complex, subject to varying interpretations and we are often engaged in litigation regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances.

In
June 2008, four of our sites in Southern Indiana, including our Technical Center, experienced extensive flood damage. In October 2011, we received $40 million from our
insurance carriers to settle all outstanding 2008 flood claims. As a result, we recognized a gain of approximately $38 million ($24 million after-tax), net of any remaining flood
related expenses, in "Other operating (expense) income, net" in our

Directors does not limit the number of shares that may be purchased and was excluded from this column.

In
December 2007, the Board of Directors authorized us to acquire up to $500 million of our common stock beginning in 2008. We acquired $128 million in 2008,
$20 million in 2009, $241 million in 2010 and $111 million in 2011, completing the repurchase program. In February 2011, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase
program and authorized the acquisition of up to $1 billion of our common stock upon the completion of the $500 million program. We acquired $ 518 million of our common stock in
2011, or 5.3 million shares, leaving $ 482 million available for purchase under this authorization at December 31, 2011. We repurchased a total of 6.4 million shares of
common stock in 2011 at a cost of $629 million.



During
the fourth quarter of 2011, we repurchased 8,646 shares from employees in connection with the Key Employee Stock Investment Plan which allows certain employees, other than
officers, to purchase
shares of common stock on an installment basis up to an established credit limit. Loans are issued for initial five-year terms at a fixed interest rate established at the date of purchase
and may be refinanced after its initial five-year period for an additional five-year period. Participants must hold shares for a minimum of six months from date of purchase and
after shares are sold must wait six months before another share purchase may be made. We hold participants' shares as security for the loans and would, in effect repurchase shares if the participant
defaulted in repayment of the loan. There is no maximum amount of shares that we may purchase under this plan.

For
the year ended December 31, 2011, consolidated net income included a $68 million gain ($37 million after-tax) related to the
disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and a $53 million gain ($33 million after-tax) recorded for the disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our
light-duty filtration business, both from the Components segment, and a $38 million gain ($24 million after-tax) related to flood damage recoveries from the insurance
settlement related to a June 2008 flood in Southern Indiana. For the year ended December 31, 2010, consolidated net income included $32 million in Brazil tax recoveries ($21 million
after-tax) and $2 million in flood damage expenses. In 2010 it was determined that we overpaid a Brazilian revenue based tax during the period of 2004-2008. Consolidated net
income includes a pre-tax recovery related to tax credits on imported products arising from this overpayment. For the year ended December 31, 2009, consolidated net income included
$99 million in restructuring and other charges and a gain of $12 million related to flood damage recoveries. For the year ended December 31, 2008, consolidated net income included a $37 million
restructuring charge, a $36 million decrease in cash surrender value in corporate owned life insurance and $5 million of losses related to flood damages.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

We are a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines and engine-related
component products, including filtration, exhaust aftertreatment, fuel systems, controls systems, air handling systems and electric power generation systems. We sell our products to original equipment
manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and other customers worldwide. We have long-standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve, including PACCAR Inc,
Chrysler Group, LLC, Daimler Trucks North America, MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG, Ford Motor Company, Komatsu, Volvo AB and Case New Holland. We serve our customers through a network of more than 600
company-owned and independent distributor locations and approximately 6,500 dealer locations in more than 190 countries and territories.

Our
reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Components, Power Generation and Distribution. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and
markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers
in on-highway and various industrial markets. Our engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well as in various industrial applications, including
construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military equipment. The Components segment sells filtration products, exhaust aftertreatment systems, turbochargers and fuel systems.
The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines, generator sets and alternators. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned
distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various
OEMs throughout the world.

Our
financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve, particularly the on-highway, construction and general industrial markets.
Demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rate levels and our customers' access to credit. Our sales
may also be impacted by OEM inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages. Economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products. As a
worldwide business, our operations are also affected by currency, political, economic and regulatory matters, including adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards, in the
countries we serve. As part of our growth strategy, we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry high levels of these risks such as China, Brazil, India, Mexico, South Africa, Russia and
countries in the Middle East. At the same time, our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a
drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results.

In
2011, certain North American markets experienced robust recoveries, especially the North American on-highway markets which was enhanced by the depletion of transition
engine inventory purchased in 2009 in advance of the EPA's 2010 emission change. Demand for heavy-duty on-highway products in North America was three times higher in 2011
compared to 2010 and medium-duty truck and bus shipments in North America were two times higher. North American oil and gas markets and global mining markets also continued to experience
strong growth in 2011. Emerging markets continued to experience strong growth in 2011, especially in the international construction markets. Emerging market growth was particularly strong in China,
India and Brazil, although the growth rates began to soften in the second half of the year, especially in the on-highway truck and off-highway construction markets in China and
power generation markets in India. Growth rates are slowing in certain emerging markets like China and India as governments look to control inflation through tight monetary policies in the form of
rising interest rates and tightening access to credit. Currently, inflation concerns appear to be declining in China and there is a growing expectation that the government will start to ease monetary
policy, which would enhance our end markets. Inflation concerns in India also appear to be



declining.
The European economy remains an uncertainty as we enter 2012, with continued volatility in the Euro countries. Although we do not have any significant direct exposure to European sovereign
debt, we do generate approximately nine percent of our net sales from Euro zone countries. Therefore, continued economic decline in Europe could have an adverse impact on our financial results.

The
following table contains sales and EBIT results by operating segment for the years ended 2011 and 2010. Refer to the section titled "Operating Segment Results" for a more detailed
discussion of net sales and EBIT by operating segment including the reconciliation of segment EBIT to income before taxes.

Net
income attributable to Cummins Inc. for 2011 was $1,848 million, or $9.55 per diluted share, on sales of $18.0 billion, compared to 2010 net income attributable
to Cummins Inc. of $1,040 million, or $5.28 per diluted share, on sales of $13.2 billion. The increase in income was driven by higher volumes in most markets and geographic
regions, including the recovery of the North American on-highway truck markets, stronger demand in certain emerging markets, significantly improved gross margins, the gain on disposition
of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and light-duty filtration business, a lower effective tax rate, increased equity income and the gain related to flood damage
recoveries from the insurance settlement regarding a June 2008 flood in Southern Indiana. These were partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development
and engineering expenses in 2011 as compared to 2010. Diluted earnings per share for 2011 also benefited $0.17 from lower shares primarily due to the stock repurchase program.

In
2011, we recorded a gain on the disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business of $68 million ($37 million after-tax or $0.19 per
diluted share) and a gain on the disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our light-duty filtration business of $53 million ($33 million after-tax or
$0.17 per diluted share). For a detailed discussion of the divestitures, see Note 2, "DIVESTITURES AND ACQUISITIONS," to the

Consolidated Financial
Statements

. Also in 2011, we recorded a gain related to flood damage recoveries from the insurance settlement for a June 2008 flood in Southern Indiana of $38 million
($24 million after-tax or $0.13 per diluted share). For a detailed discussion of the gain, see Note 14, "COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES," to the

Consolidated Financial Statements

. The gains
have been excluded from segment results as they were not considered in our evaluation of operating results
for the year. In 2010, we recorded a recovery of $32 million ($21 million after-tax, or $0.11 per diluted share) related to the overpayment of revenue based taxes on imported
products in Brazil from 2004-2008. The tax recovery was recorded in cost of sales in our non segment business results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for
the year.

We
generated $2.1 billion of operating cash flows in 2011, compared to $1.0 billion in 2010. Refer to the section titled "Operating Activities" in the "Liquidity and
Capital Resources" section for a discussion of items impacting cash flows.



In
December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the acquisition of up to $500 million of our common stock which was completed in the first quarter of 2011. In February 2011,
the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program and authorized the acquisition of up to $1 billion of Cummins common stock upon the completion of the $500 million program.
We repurchased $629
million in 2011, $ 111 million of which was under the repurchase program that was originally authorized in 2007 and $ 518 million of which was under the repurchase program that was
authorized in 2011.

In
July 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a dividend increase of 52 percent to $0.40 per share on a quarterly basis effective in the third quarter. Our debt to capital ratio
(capital is defined as debt plus equity) at December 31, 2011, was 11.8 percent, compared to 14.4 percent at December 31, 2010. As of the date of filing of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K, we had a Baa1 credit rating with a positive outlook from Moody's Investors Service, Inc., an A credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard &
Poor's Rating Services and an A- credit rating and a positive outlook from Fitch Ratings. In addition to our $1.8 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand, we have
sufficient access to our revolving credit facility with $1.2 billion available, net of outstanding letters of credit and our accounts receivable program with $209 million available,
based on eligible reserves, to meet currently anticipated growth and funding needs.

Our
global pension plans, including our unfunded non-qualified plans, were 98 percent funded at year-end 2011. Our U.S. qualified plan, which represents
approximately 60 percent of our worldwide pension obligation, was 103 percent funded and the international plans were 106 percent funded. Asset returns in 2011 for the U.S.
qualified plan were 13 percent while the year-end 2011 discount rate was 4.8 percent, down 0.6 percentage points from the 2010 discount rate of 5.4 percent. We
expect to contribute $130 million of cash to our global pension plans in 2012. We do not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for our U.S. plans in 2012. We expect pension
and other postretirement benefit expense in 2012 to increase by approximately $4 million pre-tax, or $0.01 per diluted share, when compared to 2011. Refer to application of critical
accounting estimates within MD&A and Note 12, "PENSION AND OTHER POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS," to the

Consolidated Financial Statements

, for
additional information concerning our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.

2012 OUTLOOK

Near-Term:

In 2011, North America experienced a robust recovery in demand in heavy-, medium- and light-duty on-highway
truck markets. Economies in emerging markets, including China, India and Brazil, experienced strong growth although demand began to soften in the second half of the year, especially in
on-highway truck and off-highway construction markets in China and power generation markets in India.

We
currently expect the following positive trends in 2012:

•

The North American on-highway truck markets are expected to remain strong.

•

Global oil and gas and mining markets are expected to remain strong.

•

India's power generation markets are expected to improve and truck orders are expected to remain strong.

•

Brazil is expected to continue experiencing growth in the power generation business and is anticipating growth in the
aftertreatment business as the result of the 2012 emissions change.

•

Components sales in Brazil are expected to increase following the implementation of Euro V emission regulations.



We
currently expect the following challenges to our business that may reduce our earnings potential in 2012:

•

In China and India, demand in certain industrial markets could remain low in the first half of 2012, although improvements
are expected in the second half of the year.

•

Our engine sales in Brazil in 2012 could be negatively impacted by pre-buy activity in the second half of 2011
ahead of the implementation of Euro V emission regulations, as well as one of our customers replacing our B6.7 engine with their own proprietary engine.

•

Demand in certain European markets could decline in 2012.

•

We will increase our investment in new product development.

•

Currency volatility could put pressure on earnings in 2012.

Long-Term:

We believe that, over the longer term, there will be economic improvements in most of our current markets and that our opportunities
for long-term profitable growth will continue in the future.

Net Sales

Sales increased in all segments primarily due to increased demand from most markets including recovery of the North American
on-highway markets. The primary drivers for the increase in sales were:

•

Engine segment sales increased by 43 percent due to increased demand in all lines of business led by
heavy-duty truck, industrial and medium-duty truck and bus businesses.

•

Components segment sales increased by 33 percent due to increased demand in all lines of business led by emission
solutions and turbo technologies businesses.

•

Power Generation segment sales increased by 20 percent due to increased demand in all lines of business led by
commercial products and generator technologies businesses and improved price realization.

•

Distribution segment sales increased by 31 percent due to increased demand in all product lines and all geographic
regions led by Asia Pacific, North and Central America, Europe and Middle East regions.

A
more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section.

Sales
to international markets were 59 percent of total net sales in 2011, compared with 64 percent of total net sales in 2010.

Gross Margin

Gross margin increased by $ 1,421 million and as a percentage of sales increased by 1.4 percentage points. The
significant improvement was led by increases in volume, improved price realization, higher product content on certain products and favorable currency impacts, partially offset by higher material
costs, higher commodity costs and higher base warranty costs due to increased volumes and increasing mix of EPA 2010 products. Gross margin in 2010 also benefited from a one-time
$32 million tax recovery in Brazil. See Note 14, "COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES," in our

Consolidated Financial Statements

for more
information.

The
provision for warranties issued as a percentage of sales in 2011 was 2.1 percent compared to 3.0 percent in 2010. Accrual rates for engines sold this year were
generally lower than the rates charged in prior years as our warranty costs for EPA 2010 products have been lower than expected. A more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the
"OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to an increase of $174 million in compensation and related
expenses including increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives, merit increases and increased discretionary spending. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe
benefits and variable compensation. Variable compensation related to 2011 performance increased $42 million over variable compensation related to 2010 performance. Overall, selling, general and
administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased from 11.2 percent in 2010 to 10.2 percent in 2011.



Research, Development and Engineering Expenses

Research, development and engineering expenses increased primarily due to an increase of $79 million in compensation and related
expenses, an increase in the number of engineering programs with increased costs of $79 million and increased discretionary spending. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe
benefits and variable compensation. Variable compensation related to 2011 performance increased $8 million over variable compensation related to 2010 performance. Overall, research, development
and engineering expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 3.5 percent in 2011 from 3.1 percent in 2010. Research activities continue to focus on development of new products to
meet future emission standards around the world and improvements in fuel economy performance.

Equity, Royalty and Interest Income From Investees

These
overall increases were primarily due to the economic recovery in North America, particularly in the oil and gas markets, and strong demand for power generation and mining products
in China with CCEC, which was partially offset by lower sales at DCEC due to weaker demand in the on-highway truck market.

Gain on Sale of Businesses

In the second quarter of 2011, we sold certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business which manufactures exhaust products and
select components for emission systems for a variety of applications not core to our other product offerings. This business was historically included in our Components segment. The sales price was
$123 million. We recognized a gain on the sale of $68 million ($37 million after-tax), which included a goodwill allocation of $19 million. The gain was
excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Sales
for this business were $62 million, $171 million and $126 million in 2011 (through closing), 2010 and 2009, respectively. Operating results for this business
were approximately $9 million, $22 million and $11 million in 2011 (through closing), 2010 and 2009, respectively.

During
the fourth quarter of 2011, we sold certain assets and liabilities of our light-duty filtration business which manufactures light-duty automotive and
industrial filtration solutions. The sales price was $90 million and included a note receivable from the buyer of approximately $1 million. There are no earnouts or other contingencies
associated with the sales price. We recognized a gain on the sale of $53 million ($33 million after-tax), which included a goodwill allocation of $6 million. The gain
was excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Sales
for this business were $64 million, $74 million and $54 million in 2011 (through closing), 2010 and 2009, respectively. Operating results for this business
were approximately $13 million, $9 million and $2 million in 2011 (through closing), 2010 and 2009, respectively.



We
have entered into supply and other agreements with the operations that represent ongoing involvement and as such, the results of these operations have not been presented as
discontinued operations.

In
June 2008, four of our sites in Southern Indiana, including our Technical Center, experienced extensive flood damage. In October 2011, we received $40 million from our
insurance carriers to settle all outstanding 2008 flood claims. As a result, we recognized a gain of approximately $38 million ($24 million after-tax), net of any remaining
flood related expenses, in "Other operating (expense) income, net" in our

Consolidated Statements of Income

Interest Income

Interest income increased primarily due to higher average cash balances in addition to higher average interest rates.

Income Tax Expense

Our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on
foreign earnings and research tax credits. Our effective tax rate for 2011 was 27.1 percent compared to 29.5 percent for 2010. Our 2011 income tax provision includes a discrete tax
benefit of $48 million related to prior year refund claims filed for additional research tax credits, as well as additional foreign income and related foreign tax credits, net of related tax
reserves. Our effective tax rate for 2011 also includes a tax benefit of $19 million related to the release of deferred U.S. tax liabilities on certain foreign earnings, as a result of
restructuring our foreign operations. Also included in 2011 is a discrete tax benefit of $16 million resulting from the reduction of our unrecognized tax benefits primarily due to settlements
with taxing authorities. The
2011 income tax provision also includes other discrete tax items totaling to a $2 million net tax charge, primarily relating to the enactment of state law changes in Indiana and the U.K. as
well as adjustments to our income tax accounts based on our 2010 tax return filings. Our 2010 income tax provision includes a $17 million reduction in the fourth quarter related to the
legislative reinstatement of the U.S. research tax credit as well as a $3 million discrete tax benefit related to the release of deferred U.S. tax liabilities on foreign earnings now considered
to be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S.

We
expect our 2012 effective tax rate to be 29 percent excluding any discrete items that may arise. The research tax credit expired December 31, 2011, and has not yet been
renewed by Congress. If the research credit is reinstated, we would anticipate the 2012 effective tax rate to be 28 percent. Earnings of our China operations will be considered to be
permanently reinvested beginning in 2012 and additional U.S. deferred tax will no longer be provided on future earnings. We have $693 million of retained earnings and related cumulative
translation adjustments in our China operations as of December 31, 2011 and have provided a U.S. deferred tax liability of $172 million related to these earnings that will be distributed
to the U.S. in the future as well as the related translation impacts as of December 31, 2011.

Noncontrolling Interests

Noncontrolling interests eliminate the income or loss attributable to non-Cummins ownership interests in our consolidated
entities. Noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries decreased primarily due to a decline of $9 million at Wuxi Cummins Turbo Technologies Co. Ltd. and
$4 million at Cummins India Ltd., a publicly traded company on various exchanges in India. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $6 million at Cummins Western
Canada LP, $4 million at Cummins Power Systems LLC and $1 million at Cummins Northeast LLC.

Net Income Attributable to Cummins Inc. and Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to Cummins Inc.

Net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to Cummins Inc. increased primarily due to higher volumes in most markets
and geographic regions, including the recovery of the North American on-highway truck markets, significantly improved gross margins, the gain on disposition of certain assets and
liabilities of our exhaust business and our light-duty filtration business, a lower effective tax rate, increased equity income and the gain related to flood damage recoveries from the
insurance settlement regarding a June 2008 flood in Southern Indiana. These favorable drivers were partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and
engineering expenses in 2011 as compared to 2010. Diluted earnings per share for 2011 also benefited $0.17 from lower shares primarily due to the stock repurchase program.



2010 vs. 2009

Net Sales

Sales increased in all segments primarily due to increased demand from the recovery of emerging markets and improvement in developed
markets. The primary drivers for the increase in sales were:

•

Engine segment sales increased by 23 percent due to increased demand in most lines of business, led by increased
demand in international industrial sales, stationary power engine sales, North American light-duty automotive sales and international medium-duty truck sales.

•

Components segment sales increased by 29 percent due to increased demand in all lines of business led by emission
solutions, turbo technologies and filtration businesses.

•

Power Generation segment sales increased by 21 percent due to increased sales in most lines of business led by
commercial products.

•

Distribution segment sales increased by 30 percent primarily due to the acquisition of the majority interest in an
equity investee and increased sales in all geographic regions.

A
more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section.

Sales
to international markets were 64 percent of total net sales in 2010, compared with 52 percent of total net sales in 2009.

Gross Margin

Gross margin increased by $999 million and as a percentage of sales increased by 3.9 percentage points. The significant
improvement was led by higher volumes, decreases in warranty expense, increased pricing and favorable material costs.

The
warranty provision on sales issued in 2010 as a percentage of sales was 3.0 percent compared to 3.3 percent in 2009. The decrease as a percentage of sales was primarily
due to engine mix. A more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section.

In
the third quarter of 2010, it was determined that we overpaid a Brazilian revenue based tax on imported products during the period 2004-2008. Our results include a
pre-tax recovery of $32 million in cost of sales ($21 million after-tax) related to tax credits arising from an overpayment. This recovery has been excluded from
segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher volumes in support of the business and an increase of
$151 million in compensation and related expenses. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. Variable compensation related to 2010
performance increased $93 million over variable
compensation related to 2009 performance. Salaries and fringe benefits increased due to severance actions taken throughout 2009 that were partially offset by increased employment in 2010. Overall,
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased slightly to 11.2 percent in 2010 from 11.5 percent in 2009.

Research, Development and Engineering Expenses

Research, development and engineering expenses increased primarily due to an increase of $35 million in compensation and related
expenses and a decrease of $24 million in reimbursements.



Compensation
and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. Variable compensation related to 2010 performance increased $20 million over variable compensation
related to 2009 performance. Overall, research, development and engineering expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased slightly to 3.1 percent in 2010 from 3.4 percent in 2009.
Research activities continue to focus on development of new products to meet future emission standards around the world and improvements in fuel economy performance.

The
foreign currency exchange losses in 2009 were due to unfavorable currency fluctuations; primarily in the British Pound and Brazilian Real.

Income Tax Expense

Our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on
foreign earnings and research tax credits. Our effective tax rate for 2010 was 29.5 percent compared to 24.4 percent for 2009. Our 2010 income tax provision also includes a
$17 million (1.1 percent) reduction in the fourth quarter related to the legislative reinstatement of the U.S. research tax credit. During 2010, we also released $3 million
(0.2 percent) of deferred U.S. tax liabilities on foreign earnings now considered to be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. Our 2009 income tax provision also includes a
$29 million (4.5 percent) reduction in the fourth quarter related to adjustments to deferred tax accounts. In 2009, we released $19 million of deferred tax liabilities on foreign
earnings now considered to be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. and recorded a deferred tax asset of $10 million related to prior period matters.

Noncontrolling Interests

Noncontrolling interests eliminate the income or loss attributable to non-Cummins ownership interests in our consolidated
entities. Noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries increased primarily due to an increase of $18 million at Cummins India Ltd., a publicly traded company on
various exchanges in India and a $15 million increase from Wuxi Cummins Turbo Technologies Co. Ltd., reflecting the economic recovery in emerging markets.

Net Income Attributable to Cummins Inc. and Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to Cummins Inc.

Net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to Cummins Inc. increased primarily due to higher volumes in emerging
markets and certain developed countries, significantly improved gross margins, increased equity income and restructuring charges incurred in 2009 that were not repeated in 2010. These were partially
offset by higher income tax expense, selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses. Diluted earnings per share also benefited $0.06 from lower shares
primarily due to the stock repurchase program.



RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES

2009 Restructuring Actions

In 2009, we executed restructuring actions in response to a reduction in orders in most of our U.S. and foreign markets due to the
deterioration in the global economy. We reduced our global workforce by approximately 1,000 professional employees. In addition, we took numerous employee actions at many of our manufacturing
locations, including approximately 3,200 hourly employees, significant downsizing at numerous facilities and complete closure of several facilities and branch distributor locations. Employee
termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under
existing severance plans, union contracts or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan. Estimates of restructuring costs were made based on information available at
the time charges were recorded.

In
response to closures and downsizing noted above, we incurred $2 million of restructuring expenses for lease terminations and $5 million of restructuring expenses for
asset impairments. During 2009, we recorded a total pre-tax restructuring charge of $85 million, comprising $90 million of charges related to 2009 actions net of the
$3 million favorable change in estimate related to 2008 actions and the $2 million favorable change in estimate related to earlier 2009 actions, in "Restructuring and other charges" in

OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS

Our reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Components, Power Generation and Distribution. This reporting
structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine
segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various industrial markets. Our engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well
as in various industrial applications, including construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military equipment. The Components segment sells filtration products, exhaust
aftertreatment systems, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines, generator sets and alternators. The Distribution
segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products
and maintaining relationships with various OEMs throughout the world.

We
use segment EBIT (defined as earnings before interest expense, taxes and noncontrolling interests) as a primary basis for the chief operating decision-maker to evaluate the
performance of each of our operating segments. Segment amounts exclude certain expenses not specifically identifiable to segments.

The
accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those applied in our

Consolidated Financial Statements

. We prepared the
financial results of our operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We
have allocated certain common costs and expenses, primarily corporate functions, among segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). These include certain costs and expenses of shared services, such as information technology, human resources, legal and finance.
We also do not allocate debt-related items, actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, changes in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance, restructuring and
other charges, flood damage gains or losses, or income taxes to individual segments. In 2011 non-segment items included the gain on disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our
exhaust business and our light-duty filtration business while 2010 included a Brazil revenue tax recovery. These gains were not allocated to the businesses as they were not considered in
our evaluation of operating results for the year. Segment EBIT may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.



Following
is a discussion of operating results for each of our business segments.

2011 vs. 2010

Sales

Engine segment sales increased in all businesses versus 2010, as demand improved in most markets including a significant rebound in
North American on-highway markets, improvements in international construction markets, increased demand in global mining markets and significant increases in oil and gas markets. The
following are the primary drivers by market:

•

Heavy-duty truck engine sales increased due to recovery in North American on-highway markets as
OEM customers replace their aging fleets and the depletion of transition engine inventory purchased in 2009 in advance of the EPA's 2010 emission standard changes.

•

Industrial market sales increased primarily due to a 26 percent improvement in international construction engine
shipments driven by the economic recovery and infrastructure improvements in certain emerging markets, increased demand in advance of off-highway emission regulations in the U.S. and
Europe, a 46 percent increase in units sold in the global mining engine markets due to increased coal and commodity demands and more than double the number of oil and gas engine shipments in
North America.

•

Medium-duty truck and bus sales increased primarily due to the recovery in North American
on-highway markets, the depletion of transition engine inventory purchased in 2009 in advance of the EPA's 2010 emissions change and higher demand in the Brazilian truck engine market
driven by a growing economy.

Total
on-highway-related sales for 2011 were 56 percent of total engine segment sales, compared to 50 percent in 2010.

Segment EBIT

Engine segment EBIT increased significantly versus 2010, primarily due to higher gross margin, partially offset by increased selling,
general and administrative expenses and
research, development and engineering expenses. Changes in Engine segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows:

(0.5

The
increase in gross margin versus 2010, was primarily due to higher volumes, improved price realization and favorable mix, partially offset by higher commodity costs and higher base
warranty costs due to increased volumes and increasing mix of EPA 2010 products. Although our warranty costs increased, our warranty cost as a percentage of sales decreased as actual accrual rates for
engines sold this year were generally lower than rates charged in prior years as our warranty costs for EPA 2010 engines have been lower than expected. The increases in selling, general and
administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses were primarily due to new product development spending and increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives.
The increase in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was primarily due to strong demand for power generation and mining products in China with CCEC and strong export sales to Russia and
Brazil in the midrange
on-highway market with Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd., which was partially offset by lower sales at DCEC due to weaker demand in the on-highway
heavy-duty and medium-duty truck market in China.



2010 vs. 2009

Sales

Engine segment sales increased versus 2009, due to improved sales in most markets, especially the industrial, stationary power,
light-duty automotive and medium-duty truck markets, which were partially offset by decreases in the North American heavy-duty truck market. The following are the
primary drivers by market.

•

Industrial market sales increased primarily due to a 154 percent improvement in international construction engine
shipments driven by the economic recovery and infrastructure investment in emerging markets and a 123 percent improvement in units sold in the international mining markets due to increased coal
and commodity demands.

•

Stationary power engine sales increased primarily due to higher demand in power generation markets, particularly for
high-horse power engines.

•

Light-duty automotive sales increased significantly due to a 77 percent improvement in units sold to
Chrysler as the result of shut-downs in 2009 as part of its reorganization efforts.

•

Medium-duty truck engine sales increased due to a 78 percent increase in international units sold,
primarily due to higher demand in the Brazilian truck market driven by a growing economy and government incentives.

These
increases were partially offset by a decline in heavy-duty truck engine sales. Consistent with prior emission standards changes, North American (includes the U.S and
Canada and excludes Mexico) unit sales declined 61 percent due to higher engine purchases by OEMs in late 2009, ahead of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA)'s 2010 emission
standards change, as part of the OEM's transition plan.

Total
on-highway-related sales for 2010 were 50 percent of total engine segment sales, compared to 61 percent in 2009.

Segment EBIT

Engine segment EBIT increased significantly versus 2009, primarily due to higher gross margin and equity, royalty and interest income
from investees which were partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses. Changes in Engine segment EBIT and EBIT as a
percentage of sales were as follows:

The
increase in gross margin versus 2009, was primarily due to higher volumes, improved price realization, decreased warranty expense and cost structure improvements from actions taken
in late
2008 and early 2009, partially offset by an unfavorable mix. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher variable compensation which resulted from the
segment's strong performance. Equity, royalty and interest income from investees increased in most



unconsolidated
joint ventures. The increase was led by higher demand in emerging markets, especially at DCEC and Komatsu-Cummins Engine Company (KCEC).

2011 vs. 2010

Sales

Components segment sales increased in all businesses versus 2010. The following are the primary regional drivers by
business:

•

Emission solutions business sales increased due to the increased sales volume of North American EPA 2010 aftertreatment
systems and increased demand for Euro V aftertreatment systems in Europe, which were partially offset by lower sales due to the sale of the exhaust business.

•

Turbo technologies business sales increased due to higher OEM demand in North America, Europe, India and Brazil and
improved aftermarket demand.

•

Fuel systems business sales increased primarily due to improved demand in North American on-highway markets.



•

Filtration business sales increased due to improved aftermarket demand, especially in Asia Pacific and Europe, higher OEM
demand due to the recovery in North American on-highway markets and favorable foreign currency impacts which were partially offset by lower sales due to the disposition of certain assets
and liabilities of our exhaust and light-duty filtration businesses.

Segment EBIT

Components segment EBIT increased versus 2010, primarily due to the improved gross margin which was partially offset by increased
research, development and engineering expenses and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in Components segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows:

The
increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher volumes for all businesses and increased product content on 2010 North American truck engines. The increases in research,
development and engineering expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses were primarily due to new product development spending and increased headcount to support our strategic growth
initiatives. The increase in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was driven by improved joint venture income from both the filtration business in China and India and the fuel systems
business.

In
2011, we sold certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and light-duty filtration business and recognized $68 million and $53 million,
respectively, in pre-tax gain on the sales. The gains have been excluded from Components results as they were not considered in our evaluation of Components operating results for the year
ended 2011. See Note 2, "DIVESTITURES AND ACQUISITIONS," to the

Consolidated Financial Statements.

2010 vs. 2009

Sales

Components segment sales increased in all businesses versus 2009. The following are the primary regional drivers by business.

•

Emission solutions business sales increased due to higher technology content and increased sales of North American EPA
2010 aftertreatment systems and higher European demand for aftertreatment systems for the first fit market, which were partially offset by decreased sales of our EPA 2007 aftertreatment systems.

•

Turbo technologies business sales increased due to improved original equipment demand in Europe and China and significant
global aftermarket recovery.

•

Filtration business sales increased in all regions primarily due to global aftermarket recovery and improved global
original equipment sales.



•

Fuel systems business sales increased primarily due to improved OEM first fit sales in China and the aftermarket recovery
in North America, which was partially offset by decreased first fit sales in North America.

Segment EBIT

Components segment EBIT almost tripled versus 2009, primarily due to the improved gross margin which was partially offset by increased
selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses. Changes in Components segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows:

2011 vs. 2010

Sales

Distribution segment sales increased for all product lines versus 2010. The following were the primary drivers by line of
business:

•

Engine product sales increased primarily due to growth in the oil and gas markets in North and Central America, improved
demand in certain markets in Europe, partially driven by pre-buy activity ahead of the 2012 emissions change, and higher demand in Africa.

•

Power generation product sales increased primarily due to improved project-based business across North and Central
America, South Pacific, Middle East and Europe, increased demand from Japan's earthquake recovery and the acquisition of a previously independent distributor in 2010.

•

Parts and filtration product sales increased primarily due to higher demand in North and Central America, the acquisition
of a previously independent distributor in 2010, higher demand from mining customers in the South Pacific, improved sales in East Asia as the result of overall market recovery and increasing engine
populations and higher demand driven by economic recovery in Europe.

•

Foreign currency fluctuations also favorably impacted sales.

Segment EBIT

Distribution segment EBIT increased versus 2010, primarily due to improved gross margin and equity, royalty and interest income from
investees, which was partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment EBIT was also unfavorably impacted by the absence of a one-time gain of
$12 million from the acquisition of Cummins Western Canada in 2010. Changes in Distribution segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows:

impacts. The increase in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was primarily due to higher income from North American distributors, especially in the oil and gas markets, and increased
parts sales.

acquisitions represent the purchase of the majority interest in Cummins Western Canada (CWC), an equity investee, in the first quarter of 2010 and the
purchase of a majority interest in a previously independent North American distributorship, as explained in Note 2, "DIVESTITURES AND ACQUISITIONS," to the

Consolidated
Financial Statements

. The acquisition of CWC and the majority interest in the distributorship increased sales by $286 million and EBIT by $30 million in 2010. The
2009 data does not exclude the acquisition which occurred in 2009.

(2)

This
amount includes $13 million of equity earnings which would have been our share of CWC's income for 2010 if we had not consolidated them.

Sales

Distribution segment sales, excluding the acquisitions, increased versus 2009, due to increased parts and service revenues, increased
engine sales driven by sales in Europe and the South Pacific and favorable foreign currency impacts in most regions.

Segment EBIT

Distribution segment EBIT increased versus 2009, primarily due to increased gross margin and a one-time gain from an
acquisition that occurred in the first quarter, partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in Distribution segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Management's Assessment of Liquidity

Our financial condition and liquidity continue to strengthen. Our solid balance sheet and credit ratings enable us to have ready access
to credit.

We
assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. We generate significant ongoing cash flow, which has
been used, in part, to fund repurchases of common stock, capital expenditures and pay dividends on our common stock. Our cash flow from operations in 2011 more than doubled the 2010 cash flow from
operations. Cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2011, other sources of liquidity included:

•

cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 billion, of which approximately 32 percent was located in the U.S. and
59 percent was located primarily in the U.K., China, Brazil and India,



•

marketable securities of $277 million, which were located primarily in India and Brazil and the majority of which could be
liquidated into cash within a few days,

•

revolving credit facility with $1.2 billion available, net of outstanding letters of credit,

•

international and other domestic credit facilities with $300 million available and

•

accounts receivable sales program with $209 million available, based on eligible receivables.

We
believe our liquidity provides us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital, capital expenditures, projected pension obligations, dividend payments, common stock
repurchases and debt service obligations.

Our
revolving credit agreement provides us with a $1.24 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, the proceeds of which are to be used for our general corporate purposes. See
Note 10, "DEBT" to our

Consolidated Financial Statements

for further information. The credit agreement includes two financial covenants: a
leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. The required leverage ratio, which measures the sum of total debt plus securitization financing to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the four fiscal quarters may not exceed 3.0 to 1. At December 31, 2011, our leverage ratio was 0.26 to 1. The required interest coverage ratio, which
is consolidated EBITDA minus capital expenditures to consolidated interest expense, in each case for the prior four quarters, may not be less than 1.50 to 1. At December 31, 2011, our interest
coverage ratio was 53.62 to 1.

A
significant portion of our cash flows is generated outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2011, the total of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign
subsidiaries was $1.3 billion, the vast majority of which was located in the U.K., China, India, Brazil and Singapore. The geographic location of our cash and marketable securities aligns well with
our business growth strategy. We manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with
which those funds can be accessed. As a result, we do not anticipate any local liquidity restrictions to preclude us from funding our expansion or operating needs with local resources. If the foreign
cash balances were repatriated to the U.S. we could be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes for earnings primarily from our U.K. domiciled subsidiaries, as we have asserted that these earnings are
permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. At present we
do not foresee an immediate need to repatriate any earnings from these subsidiaries in the near future. However, we do anticipate repatriating available cash from foreign subsidiaries to help fund
U.S. cash needs as they arise, and we have transferred and will continue to transfer cash from these subsidiaries to the U.S. and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do
so. Earnings from our China operations will be considered permanently reinvested beginning in 2012, while earnings generated prior to 2012, for which U.S. deferred tax liabilities have already been
recorded, will be repatriated in future years.

We
continuously monitor our pension assets and believe that we have limited exposure to the European debt crisis. No sovereign debt instruments of crisis countries are held in the
trusts, while any equities are held with large well-diversified multinational firms or are de minimis amounts in large index funds. In addition, we rebalanced our asset portfolios in the
U.S. and the U.K. in 2010 with equities representing a smaller segment of the total portfolios and we continue to rebalance as necessary to maintain our target range. Our pension plans have not
experienced any significant impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility in the credit markets.

The
maturity schedule of our existing long-term debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term. Required annual principal payments range from $17
million to $97 million over each of the next five years.



Working Capital Summary

We fund our working capital with cash from operations and short-term borrowings when necessary. Various assets and
liabilities, including short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs. As a result, working capital is a prime focus
of management attention.

Current
assets increased 13 percent primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents, an increase in accounts receivable due to higher sales and an increase in inventory
levels to meet anticipated demand. Despite the increases in accounts receivable and inventories, we were able to lower days' sales in receivables in a challenging environment by 11 days through
improved collections and we increased our inventory turns by 0.5 through higher demand.

Current
liabilities increased 12 percent primarily due to higher accounts and loans payable, increased taxes payable due to higher income and higher other accrued expenses, which
was the result of increased purchasing requirements to support higher sales volume in the businesses.



Cash Flows

Cash and cash equivalents increased $461 million during the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to a $93 million increase in
cash and cash equivalents during the comparable period in 2010. The change in cash and cash equivalents was as follows:

2011 vs. 2010

Net cash provided by operating activities increased versus 2010, primarily due to significantly higher consolidated net income,
excluding the gain on the sale of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and our light-duty filtration business, as a result of higher sales volumes, higher dividends from
equity investees and favorable working capital fluctuations. During 2011, the net increase in working capital resulted in a cash outflow of $154 million compared to a cash outflow of $245 million in
2010. This decrease of $91 million was primarily driven by a smaller increase in inventory in 2011 as we significantly increased inventory levels in 2010 to meet anticipated post-recession
demand.

Pensions

The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets,
market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the



plans.
In the second half of 2011, financial markets in Europe declined significantly, reversing the prior quarters' gains in our U.K. trust investments; while the U.S. trust's liability driven fixed
income investments were able to maintain the return trends from the first half of the year. As a result, for 2011 the return for our U.S. plan was 13 percent while our U.K. plan return was
approximately six percent. Our U.K. pension plan remains in an over funded position. Approximately 94 percent of our pension plan assets are invested in highly liquid investments such as equity
and fixed income securities. The remaining six percent of our plan assets are invested in less liquid, but market valued investments, including real estate and private equity. We made $199 million of
pension contributions in 2011 (including voluntary contributions of $108 million). We anticipate making total contributions of $130 million to our defined benefit pension plans in 2012. Expected
contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2012 will meet or exceed the current funding requirements.

2010 vs. 2009

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased versus 2009, primarily due to significantly higher inventory levels to meet
anticipated demand, increased equity in income of investees net of dividends and higher pension contributions made in the year. This was partially offset by significantly higher consolidated net
income and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses as the result of increased purchasing to support higher sales volumes.

2011 vs. 2010

Net cash used in investing activities decreased versus 2010, primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of certain assets and
liabilities of our exhaust business and our light-duty filtration business (See Note 2, "DIVESTITURES AND ACQUISITIONS" to our

Consolidated Financial
Statements

), decreased acquisitions and increased liquidations of marketable securities, the acquisition of CWC in 2010 and decreased purchases of other investments. These
drivers were partially offset by increased capital expenditures, additional investments in and advances to equity investees and lower proceeds from dispositions of property, plant and equipment.

Capital
expenditures were $622 million compared to $364 million in the comparable period in 2010. We continue to invest in the development of new products and we plan to spend
approximately



$800
million to $850 million in 2012 as we continue with product launches and facility improvements and prepare for future emission standards. Approximately 50 percent of our capital
expenditures will be invested outside of the U.S. in 2012.

2010 vs. 2009

Net cash used in investing activities increased versus 2009, primarily due to acquisitions (See Note 2, "DIVESTITURES AND

2011 vs. 2010

Net cash used in financing activities increased versus 2010, primarily due to significantly higher repurchases of common stock,
increased payments on borrowings and capital lease obligations, decreased proceeds from borrowings and higher dividend payments.

Our
total debt was $783 million as of December 31, 2011, compared with $843 million as of December 31, 2010. Total debt as a percent of our total capital, including total
long-term debt, was 11.8 percent at December 31, 2011, compared with 14.4 percent at December 31, 2010.

2010 vs. 2009

Net cash used in financing activities increased versus 2009, primarily due to increased repurchases of common stock, which was
partially offset by higher proceeds from borrowings primarily related to the acquisition of CWC and borrowings in Brazil.

Our
total debt was $843 million as of December 31, 2010, compared with $703 million at December 31, 2009. Total debt as a percent of our total capital,
including total long-term debt, was 14.4 percent at December 31, 2010, compared to 14.9 percent at December 31, 2009. The increase in total debt was principally
due to acquisitions and borrowings in Brazil which were subsequently invested in marketable securities.



Repurchase of Common Stock

In December 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the acquisition of up to $500 million of our common stock, which was
completed in February 2011.

dividend payments with cash from operations.

Credit Ratings

A number of our contractual obligations and financing agreements, such as our revolving credit facility, have restrictive covenants
and/or pricing modifications that may be triggered in the event of downward revisions to our corporate credit rating. There were no downgrades of our credit ratings in 2011. In September 2011,
Standard & Poor's Rating Services upgraded our rating to 'A' and changed our outlook to stable. In June 2011, Fitch Ratings upgraded our rating and changed our outlook to stable. In November
2011, Fitch Ratings affirmed our rating and revised our outlook to positive. In November 2011, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. raised our rating to Baa1 and changed our outlook to positive.

Credit
ratings are not recommendations to buy, are subject to change and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. In addition, we undertake no obligation to
update disclosures concerning our credit ratings, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Our ratings and outlook from each of the credit rating agencies as of the date of

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 1, "SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES," of our

Consolidated Financial
Statements

which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives.

Our

Consolidated Financial Statements

are prepared in accordance with GAAP which often requires management to make judgments, estimates
and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements. Management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical
experience, changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In any given reporting period, our actual results may differ from the
estimates and assumptions used in preparing our

Consolidated Financial Statements.

Critical
accounting estimates are defined as follows: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made;
different estimates reasonably could have been used; or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial
condition or results of operations. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies, related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with
the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs, recoverability of investment
related to new products, accounting for income taxes and pension benefits.

Warranty Programs

We estimate and record a liability for base warranty programs at the time our products are sold. Our estimates are based on historical
experience and reflect management's best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected
costs when actual costs differ. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs, the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall
action or when a recall becomes probable and estimable, which generally occurs when it is announced. Our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates, repair costs and the point
of failure within the product life cycle. Future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability. New product launches
require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. Product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch,
with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch. We generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a preceding product's warranty history and a multiplicative
factor based upon preceding similar product experience and new product assessment until sufficient new product data is available for warranty estimation. We then use a blend of actual new product
experience and preceding product



historical
experience for several subsequent quarters, and new product specific experience thereafter. Note 11, "PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY," to our

Consolidated
Financial Statements

contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2011 and 2010 including adjustments to pre-existing warranties.

Recoverability of Investment Related to New Products

At December 31, 2011, we have capitalized $221 million associated with the future launch of our light-duty
diesel engine product. Development of this product began in 2006. Market uncertainty related to the global recession that began in 2008 resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle
programs. At December 31, 2009, we reviewed our investment of $216 million for possible impairment. We used projections to assess whether future cash flows on an undiscounted basis
related to the assets are likely to exceed the related carrying amount to determine if a write-down is appropriate. These projections required estimates about product volume and the size
of the market for vehicles that are not yet developed. We used input from our customers in developing alternative cash flow scenarios. Our analysis indicated that the assets were recoverable.
Customers that are expected to purchase sufficient quantities to recover our investment in the light-duty diesel engine products remained active with the development of this product
through 2011 and there were no significant changes to the assumptions used in 2009. If customer expectations or projected volumes deteriorate and we do not identify alternative customers and/or
product applications, we could be required to write-down these assets to net realizable value.

Accounting for Income Taxes

We determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future tax benefits
of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future
profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2011, we recorded net deferred tax assets of
$417 million. These assets included $128 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance of $71 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to
the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized. In the event our operating performance deteriorates, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will
be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex
issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax
positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available. A more complete description
of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in Note 4, "INCOME TAXES," to our

Consolidated Financial
Statements

.

Pension Benefits

We sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the U.S. and the U.K. and to a lesser degree in various other countries. In the U.S.
and the U.K. we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded. We account for our pension programs in accordance with employers' accounting for defined benefit pension and other
postretirement plans under GAAP. GAAP requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis. As a result, our pension benefit programs are based on a number
of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to



anticipate
future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at December 31. These assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities,
assumed rates of return on plan assets, future compensation increases, employee turnover rates, actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age, mortality rates and participant withdrawals. The
actuarial assumptions we
use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions, participant life span and withdrawal rates. These differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net
periodic pension expense to be recorded in our

Consolidated Financial Statements

in the future.

The
expected long-term return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension expense. We considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return
on plan assets. The long-term rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a 5-year
average market value of return. Projected returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment
management. As of December 31, 2011, based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our U.S. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the
10-year projection period equal to or in excess of 7.5 percent approximately 50 percent of the time while returns of 10.0 percent or greater are anticipated
25 percent of the time. We expect additional positive returns from active investment management. The 2011 one year return was 13 percent, combined with the very favorable returns in 2010
has eliminated the significant deterioration in pension assets experienced in 2008 as a result of the credit crisis and related market recession. Based on the historical returns and forward-looking
return expectations, we believe an investment return assumption of 8.0 percent per year in 2012 for U.S. pension assets is reasonable. The methodology used to determine the rate of return on
pension plan assets in the U.K. was based on establishing an equity-risk premium over current long-term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations. As of
December 31, 2011, based upon our target asset allocations, it is anticipated that our U.K. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20-year projection
period equal to or in excess of 6.0 percent approximately 50 percent of the time while returns of 6.9 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time. We expect
additional positive returns from active investment management. The one year return for our U.K. plan was approximately six percent for 2011 and similar to our U.S. plan, the 2008 market related
deterioration in our plan assets has been eliminated. Our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a long-term outlook. Therefore, the risk
and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a long-term horizon. Based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations, we believe an investment return
assumption of 6.5 percent in 2012 for U.K. pension assets is reasonable. Our pension plan asset allocation at December 31, 2011 and 2010 and target allocation for 2012 are as follows:

The differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected long-term return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to
calculate net periodic expense over five years. The table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension expense for the period 2009-2011 and our expected
rate for 2012.

A
lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension expense and reduce profitability.

GAAP
for pensions offers various acceptable alternatives to account for the differences that eventually arise between the estimates used in the actuarial valuations and the actual
results. It is acceptable to delay or immediately recognize these differences. Under the delayed recognition alternative, changes in pension obligation (including those resulting from plan amendments)
and changes in the value of assets set aside to meet those obligation are not recognized in net periodic pension cost as they occur but are recognized initially in comprehensive income and
subsequently amortized as components of net periodic pension cost systematically and gradually over future periods. In addition to this approach, GAAP also allows immediate recognition of gains or
losses. Immediate recognition introduces volatility in financial results. We have chosen to delay recognition and amortize actuarial differences over future periods. If we adopted the immediate
recognition approach, we would record a loss of $1,003 million ($669 million after-tax) for our U.S. and U.K. pension plans.

The
difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and, under certain circumstances such as when
the difference exceeds 10 percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation (PBO), amortized over future years of service. This is also true of changes to actuarial
assumptions. As of December 31, 2011, we had net pension actuarial losses of $700 million and $305 million for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively. Under GAAP, the
actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Increases in actuarial losses decreased our shareholders' equity by $96 million (after-tax)
in 2011. The increases were due to liability losses from reduced discount rates, partially offset by improved U.S. plan asset performance in 2011. As these amounts exceed 10 percent of our PBO,
the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees.

The
table below sets forth the net periodic pension expense for the period 2009 through 2011 and our expected expense for 2012.

In millions

We
expect 2012 pension expense to be approximately the same as 2011, the favorable impacts of investment returns and higher asset values are offset by higher service cost due to
increased headcount and a decrease in discount rate. The decrease in periodic pension expense in 2011, was due to improved returns on assets as the capital markets began to recover, strong
contributions in 2010 and the absence of any curtailment charges. The decrease in periodic pension expense in 2010 was due to improved returns on assets as the capital markets began to recover, strong
contributions in 2009 and the absence of any curtailment charges. Another key assumption used in the development of the net



periodic
pension expense is the discount rate. The weighted average discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension expense are set forth in the table below.

Changes
in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension expense calculation.

The
discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. The guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in GAAP
which suggests the use of a high-quality corporate bond rate. We used bond information provided by Moody's Investor Service Inc., Standard & Poor's Rating Services, Fitch
Ratings and Dominion Bond Rating. All bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the U.S. and U.K. were high-quality, non-callable bonds (Aa or better) as of
December 31, 2011, by at least two of the bond rating agencies. The average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to
value the obligations of the plans subject to GAAP for pensions and other postretirement benefits.

Our
model called for 80 years of benefit payments for the U.S. plans and 60 years of payments for the U.K. For both countries, our model matches the present value of the
plan's projected benefit payments to the market value of the theoretical settlement bond portfolio. A single equivalent discount rate is determined to align the present value of the required cash flow
with the value of the bond portfolio. The resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plan's distinct liability characteristics.

The
table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2012 net periodic pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan
assets.

The
above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. A higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension expense. A
lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension expense. It should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions
simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear.

RECENTLY ADOPTED AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted

In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended its standards related to the testing of goodwill for
impairment. The objective of this amendment is to simplify the annual goodwill impairment evaluation process. The amendment provides entities the option to first assess qualitative factors to
determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the
two-step goodwill impairment test. The two-step impairment test is now only required if an entity determines through this qualitative analysis that it is more likely than not
that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. The new rules become effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, however entities
are permitted to early adopt the standard. We elected to early adopt the standard and applied the qualitative analysis to certain reporting units in our 2011 goodwill impairment testing process.
Because the measurement of a potential impairment loss has not changed, the standard did not have a significant impact on our

Consolidated Financial
Statements

.

In
October 2009, the FASB amended its rules regarding the accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements. The objective of the amendment is to allow vendors to account for revenue
for different deliverables separately as opposed to part of a combined unit when those deliverables are provided at different times. Specifically, this amendment addresses how to separate deliverables
and simplifies the process of allocating revenue to the different deliverables when more than one deliverable exists. The new rules were effective for us beginning January 1, 2011. This
amendment did not have a significant impact on our

Consolidated Financial Statements

as multiple element arrangements are not material to our business.

In
June 2009, the FASB amended its existing standards related to the consolidation of variable interest entities, which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning
after November 15, 2009. The new standard requires entities to analyze whether their variable interests give it a controlling financial interest of a variable interest entity (VIE) and outlines
what defines a primary beneficiary. The new standard amends GAAP by: (a) changing certain rules for determining whether an entity is a VIE; (b) replacing the quantitative approach
previously required for determining the primary beneficiary with a more qualitative approach; and (c) requiring entities to continuously analyze whether they are the primary beneficiary of a
VIE among other amendments. The new standard also requires enhanced disclosures regarding an entity's involvement in a VIE. The only significant impact of the adoption of this standard was to
deconsolidate Cummins Komatsu Engine Corporation (CKEC) as of January 1, 2010 and to account for CKEC under GAAP for equity method investees. CKEC is an engine
manufacturing entity jointly owned and operated by us and our equity partner. Prior to January 1, 2010, we were deemed the primary beneficiary of this VIE due to the pricing arrangements of
purchases and the substantial volume of purchases we made from the VIE. The impact of the deconsolidation on our

Consolidated Statements of Income

was
minimal as all sales were eliminated in consolidation in the past. The most significant impacts on our

Consolidated Balance Sheets

were to decrease
current assets by $9 million, decrease long-term assets by $10 million, increase investments and advances related to equity method investees by $11 million and decrease noncontrolling
interest by $11 million in 2010.

Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Effective

In December 2011, the FASB amended its standards related to offsetting assets and liabilities. This amendment requires entities to
disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar
to a master netting agreement. This information will enable users of



the
financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position. The new rules will become effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after
January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. It is also required that the new disclosures are applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented. We do not
believe this amendment will have a significant impact on our

Consolidated Financial Statements

; however we are currently evaluating the potential
impacts to our footnote disclosures.

In
June 2011, the FASB amended its rules regarding the presentation of comprehensive income. The objective of this amendment is to improve the comparability, consistency and transparency
of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income. Specifically, this amendment requires that all non-owner changes in shareholders'
equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In addition, the standard also requires disclosure of the location of
reclassification adjustments between other comprehensive income and net income on the face of the financial statements. The new rules are scheduled to become effective during interim and annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2011. In December 2011, the FASB deferred certain aspects of this standard beyond the current effective date, specifically the provisions dealing with
reclassification adjustments. Because the standard only impacts the display of comprehensive income and does not impact what is included in comprehensive income, the standard will not have a
significant impact on our

Consolidated Financial Statements

.

In
May 2011, the FASB amended its standards related to fair value measurements and disclosures. The objective of the amendment is to improve the comparability of fair value measurements
presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. Primarily this amendment changed the wording used to
describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in addition to clarifying the Board's intent about the
application of existing fair value measurement requirements. The new standard also requires additional disclosures related to fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair
value hierarchy and requires disclosure of the categorization in the hierarchy for items which are not recorded at fair value but fair value is required to be disclosed. The new rules will become
effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, we had no fair value measurements categorized within Level 3. The only
impact for us is expected to be the disclosure of the categorization in the fair value hierarchy for those items where fair value is only disclosed (primarily our debt obligations).

ITEM 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. This risk is
closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swap contracts and interest rate swaps. As stated in our
policies and procedures, financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes, and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes. When material, we adjust the value of our
derivative contracts for counter-party or our credit risk.

Further
information regarding financial instruments and risk management is contained in Note 20, "DERIVATIVES," to our

Consolidated Financial
Statements

.

The
following describes our risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analysis performed as of December 31, 2011. The sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous, parallel
shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.



Foreign Exchange Rates

As a result of our international business presence, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks. We transact business in foreign
currencies and, as a result, our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. To help manage our exposure to exchange rate volatility, we use foreign
exchange forward contracts on a regular basis to hedge forecasted intercompany and third-party sales and purchases denominated in non-functional currencies. Our internal policy allows for
managing anticipated foreign currency cash flows for up to one year. These foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges under GAAP. The effective
portion of the unrealized gain or loss on the forward contract is deferred and reported as a component of "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" (AOCL). When the hedged forecasted transaction (sale or
purchase) occurs, the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction
affects income. The ineffective portion of the hedge, unrealized gain or loss, if any, is recognized in current income during the period of change. As of December 31, 2011, the amount we expect
to reclassify from AOCL to income over the next year is an unrealized net loss of $6 million. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, there were no circumstances that would have
resulted in the discontinuance of a foreign currency cash flow hedge.

To
minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, we enter into foreign
currency forward contracts, which are considered economic hedges. The objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward
contract. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under GAAP.

As
of December 31, 2011, the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the
currencies of such contracts, would be approximately $67 million. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant
for the next 12 months. The analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels. It should be noted that any change in
the value of the contracts, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items (see Note 20, "DERIVATIVES," to our

Consolidated Financial
Statements

).

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. We manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use
of interest rate swaps. The objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk.

In
November 2005, we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert our $250 million debt issue, due in 2028, from a fixed rate of 7.125 percent to a floating rate
based on a LIBOR spread. The terms of the swap mirror those of the debt, with interest paid semi-annually. This swap qualifies as a fair value hedge under GAAP. The gain or loss on this
derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current income as "Interest expense." The following table summarizes
these gains and losses for the years presented below:

Commodity Price Risk

We are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers. In order to protect
ourselves against future price volatility and, consequently, fluctuations in gross margins, we periodically enter into commodity swap contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw
material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations. Certain commodity swap contracts are derivative contracts that are designated as cash
flow hedges under GAAP. We also have commodity swap contracts that represent an economic hedge, however do not qualify for hedge accounting and are marked to market through earnings. For those
contracts that qualify for hedge accounting, the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss is deferred and reported as a component of AOCL. When the hedged forecasted transaction (purchase)
occurs, the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects
income. The ineffective portion of the hedge, if any, is recognized in current income in the period in which the ineffectiveness occurs. As of December 31, 2011, we expect to reclassify an
unrealized net loss of $11 million from AOCL to income over the next year. Our internal policy allows for managing these cash flow hedges for up to three years.

As
of December 31, 2011, the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity swap contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the price of such
commodities, was $13 million. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months. The analysis ignores
the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels. It should be noted that any change in the value of the swap contracts, real or hypothetical,
would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items (see Note 20, "DERIVATIVES," to the

Consolidated Financial
Statements

).

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS

Management's Report on Financial Statements and Practices

The accompanying

Consolidated Financial Statements

of Cummins Inc. were prepared
by management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts that are based on
management's best judgments and estimates. The other financial information included in the annual report is consistent with that in the financial statements.

Management
also recognizes its responsibility for conducting our affairs according to the highest standards of personal and corporate conduct. This responsibility is characterized and
reflected in key
policy statements issued from time to time regarding, among other things, conduct of its business activities within the laws of the host countries in which we operate, within The Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act and potentially conflicting interests of its employees. We maintain a systematic program to assess compliance with these policies.

To
comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we designed and implemented a structured and comprehensive compliance process to evaluate our
internal control over financial reporting across the enterprise.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of Cummins Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of our

Consolidated Financial
Statements

for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Management
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and concluded it was effective as of December 31, 2011. In making its assessment, management
utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework.

The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Cummins Inc.:

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cummins Inc. and its
subsidiaries at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying "Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting." Our responsibility is to
express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations

Cummins Inc. was founded in 1919 as a corporation in Columbus, Indiana, as one of the first diesel engine manufacturers. We are
a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines and engine-related component products, including filtration, exhaust aftertreatment, fuel
systems, controls systems, air handling systems and electric power generation systems. We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and other customers worldwide. We
serve our customers through a network of more than 600 company-owned and independent distributor locations and more than 6,500 dealer locations in more than 190 countries and territories.

Principles of Consolidation

Our

Consolidated Financial Statements

include the accounts of all wholly-owned and
majority-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries where our ownership is more than 50 percent of outstanding equity interests except for majority-owned subsidiaries that are considered variable
interest entities (VIEs) where we are not deemed to have a controlling financial interest. In addition, we also consolidate, regardless of our ownership percentage, VIEs for which we are deemed to
have a controlling financial interest. See "Recently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements" below for revised VIE standards effective January 1, 2010. Intercompany balances and
transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Where our ownership interest is less than 100 percent, the noncontrolling ownership interests are reported in our

Consolidated Balance Sheets

. The
noncontrolling ownership interest in our income, net of tax, is classified as "Net income attributable to
noncontrolling interests" in our

Consolidated Statements of Income

.

Certain
amounts for 2010 and 2009 have been reclassified to conform to the current classifications.

We
have variable interests in several businesses accounted for under the equity method of accounting that are deemed to be VIEs and are subject to the provisions of accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) for variable interest entities. None of these VIEs are consolidated and as such are included in the summary of disclosures in Note 3,
"INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INVESTEES." The VIEs are not material individually or in the aggregate to our

Consolidated Balance Sheets

or

Consolidated Statements of
Income

.

Investments in Equity Investees

We use the equity method to account for our investments in joint ventures, affiliated companies and alliances in which we have the
ability to exercise significant influence, generally represented by equity ownership or partnership equity of at least 20 percent but not more than 50 percent. Generally, under the
equity method, original investments in these entities are recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted by our share of equity in income or losses after the date of acquisition. Investment amounts in
excess of our share of an investee's assets are amortized over the life of the related asset creating the excess. If the excess is goodwill, then it is not amortized. Equity in income or losses of
each investee is recorded according to our level of ownership; if losses accumulate, we record our share of losses until our investment has been fully depleted. If our investment has been fully
depleted, we recognize additional losses only when we are the primary funding source. We eliminate (to the extent of our ownership percentage) in our

Consolidated Financial
Statements

the profit in inventory held by our equity method investees that has not yet been sold to a third-party. Our investments are classified as



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

"Investments
and advances related to equity method investees" in our

Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Our share of the results from joint ventures,
affiliated companies and alliances is reported in our

Consolidated Statements of Income

as "Equity, royalty and interest income from investees," and is
reported net of all applicable income taxes.

Our
foreign equity investees are presented net of applicable foreign income taxes in our

Consolidated Statements of Income

. The vast
majority of our United States (U.S.) equity investees are partnerships (non-taxable), thus there is no difference between gross or net of tax presentation as the investees are not taxed.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of the Financial Statements

Preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported
amounts presented and disclosed in our

Consolidated Financial Statements

. Significant estimates and assumptions in these

Consolidated Financial Statements

require the exercise of judgment and are used for, but not limited to, allowance for doubtful accounts, estimates of
future cash flows and other assumptions associated with goodwill and long-lived asset impairment tests, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, warranty programs, determination of
discount and other rate assumptions for pension and other postretirement benefit expenses, restructuring costs, income taxes and deferred tax valuation allowances, lease classification, and
contingencies. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be different from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue, net of estimated costs of returns, allowances and sales incentives, when it is realized or realizable, which
generally occurs when:

•

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,

•

The product has been shipped and legal title and all risks of ownership have been transferred,

•

The sales price is fixed and determinable and

•

Payment is reasonably assured.

Products
are generally sold on open account under credit terms customary to the geographic region of distribution. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do
not require collateral to secure our accounts receivable. For engines, service parts, service tools and other items sold to independent distributors and to partially-owned distributors accounted for
under the equity method, revenues are recorded when title and risk of ownership transfers. This transfer is based on the agreement in effect with the respective distributor and in the U.S. and most
international locations generally occurs when the products are shipped. To the extent of our ownership percentage, margins on sales to distributors accounted for under the equity method are deferred
until the distributor sells the product to unrelated parties.

We
provide various sales incentives to both our distribution network and our OEM customers. These programs are designed to promote the sale of our product in the channel or encourage the
usage of our products by OEM customers. Sales incentives primarily fall into three categories:

•

Volume rebates,



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

•

Market share rebates and

•

Aftermarket rebates.

For
volume rebates, we provide certain customers with rebate opportunities for attaining specified volumes during a particular quarter or year. We accrue for the expected amount of these
rebates at the time of the original sale and update our accruals quarterly based on our best estimate of the volume levels the customer will reach during the measurement period. For market share
rebates, we provide certain customers with rebate opportunities based on the percentage of their production that utilizes a Cummins product. These rebates are typically measured either quarterly or
annually and are accrued at the time of the original sale based on the current market shares, with adjustments made as the level changes. For aftermarket rebates we provide incentives to promote sales
to certain dealers and end-markets. These rebates are typically paid on a quarterly, or more frequent, basis and estimates are made at the end of each quarter as to the amount yet to be
paid. These estimates are based on historical experience with the particular program. The incentives are classified as a reduction in sales in our

Consolidated Statements of
Income

.

Rights
of return do not exist for a large portion of our sales, other than for quality issues. We do offer certain return rights in our aftermarket business, where some aftermarket
customers are permitted to return small amounts of parts and filters each year and in our power generation business, which sells portable generators to retail customers. An estimate of future returns
is accrued at the time of sale based on historical return rates.

Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation

We translate assets and liabilities of foreign entities to U.S. dollars, where the local currency is the functional currency, at
year-end exchange rates. We translate income and expenses to U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates for the year. We record adjustments resulting from translation in a separate
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and include the adjustments in net income only upon sale or liquidation of the underlying foreign investment.

Foreign
currency transaction gains and losses are included in current net income. For foreign entities where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, including those operating in
highly inflationary economies when applicable, we remeasure inventory, property, plant and equipment balances and the related income statement using historical exchange rates. We include in income the
resulting gains and
losses, including the effect of derivatives in our

Consolidated Statements of Income

, which combined with transaction gains and losses amounted to a net
loss of $14 million in 2011, net loss of $1 million in 2010 and a net loss of $20 million in 2009.

Derivative Instruments

We make use of derivative instruments in foreign exchange, commodity price and interest rate hedging programs. Derivatives currently in
use are foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swap contracts and an interest rate swap. These contracts are used strictly for hedging and not for speculative purposes.

Due
to our international business presence, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. We transact in foreign currencies and have significant assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies. Consequently, our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to benefit from global diversification and after considering
naturally



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

offsetting
currency positions, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize our existing exposures (recognized assets and liabilities) and hedge forecasted transactions.

We
are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers. In order to protect ourselves against future price volatility and,
consequently, fluctuations in gross margins, we periodically enter into commodity swap contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases with the objective of
minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations.

We
record all derivatives at fair value in our financial statements. Note 20, "DERIVATIVES," provides further information on our hedging strategy and accounting for derivative
financial instruments.

Income Tax Accounting

We determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future tax benefits
of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future
profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2011, we recorded net deferred tax assets of
$417 million. These assets included $128 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance of $71 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to
the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized. In the event our operating performance deteriorates, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will
be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex
issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax
positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available. A more complete description
of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in Note 4, "INCOME TAXES".

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents are defined as short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less
at the time of purchase. The carrying amounts reflected in our

Consolidated Balance Sheets

for cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to
the short-term maturity of these investments.

Marketable Securities

We account for marketable securities in accordance with GAAP for investments in debt and equity securities. We determine the
appropriate classification of all marketable securities as "held-to-maturity, "available-for-sale" or "trading" at the time of purchase, and
re-evaluate such classifications at each balance sheet date. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, all of our investments were classified as available-for-sale.

Available-for-sale
securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gain or loss, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income. Unrealized losses
considered to be "other-than-temporary" are recognized currently in income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. The fair value of most
investment securities is determined by currently available market prices. Where quoted market prices are not available, we use the market price of similar types of securities that are traded in the
market to estimate fair value. See Note 5, "MARKETABLE SECURITIES," for a detailed description of our investments in marketable securities.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, which approximates net realizable value, and generally do not bear
interest. We have a trade receivables sales program, which is more fully discussed in Note 21, "SALES OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE," which allows us to sell, without recourse, an interest in a pool
of our trade receivables to a financial institution as necessary. The allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable.
We determine the allowance based on our historical collection experience and by performing an analysis of our accounts receivable in light of the current economic environment. We review our allowance
for doubtful accounts on a regular basis. In addition, when necessary, we provide an allowance for the full amount of specific accounts deemed to be uncollectible. Account

Inventories

Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, approximately
17 percent and 16 percent, respectively, of our consolidated inventories (primarily heavy-duty and high-horsepower engines and parts) were valued using the
last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost method. The cost of other inventories is generally valued using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method. Our
inventories at interim and year-end reporting dates include estimates for adjustments related to annual physical inventory results and for inventory cost changes under the LIFO cost
method. Due to significant movements of partially-manufactured components and parts between manufacturing plants, we do not internally measure, nor do our accounting systems provide, a meaningful
segregation between raw materials and work-in-process.

Property, Plant and Equipment

We record property, plant and equipment, inclusive of assets under capital leases, at cost. We depreciate the cost of certain engine
production equipment using a modified units-of-production method, which is based upon units produced subject
to a minimum level. We depreciate the cost of all other equipment using the straight-line method with depreciable lives ranging from 20 to 40 years for buildings and three to
20 years for machinery, equipment and fixtures. Capital lease amortization is recorded in depreciation expense. We expense normal maintenance and repair costs as incurred. Depreciation expense
totaled $264 million, $248 million and $269 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Long-Lived Assets

We review our long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value
of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of the long-lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are
largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. An impairment of a long-lived asset or asset group exists when the expected future pre-tax cash flows
(undiscounted and without interest charges) estimated to be generated by the asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset or
asset group, an impairment loss is measured based on the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the asset or asset group. Assumptions and estimates used to estimate cash
flows in the evaluation of impairment and the fair values used to determine the impairment are subject to a degree of judgment and complexity. Any changes to the assumptions and estimates resulting
from changes in actual results or market conditions from those anticipated may affect the carrying value of long-lived assets and could result in a future impairment charge.

Goodwill

Under GAAP for goodwill, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that
the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform an annual two-step goodwill impairment test. The
two-step impairment test is now only required if an entity determines through this qualitative analysis that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less
than its carrying value. In addition, carrying value of goodwill must be tested for impairment on an interim basis in certain circumstances where impairment may be
indicated. When we are required or opt to perform the two-step impairment test, the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated by discounting the after tax future cash flows less
requirements for working capital and fixed asset additions. Our reporting units are generally defined as one level below an operating segment. However, there were two situations where we have
aggregated two or more components which share similar economic characteristics and thus are aggregated into a single reporting unit for testing purposes. These two situations are described further
below. This analysis has resulted in the following reporting units for our goodwill testing:

•

Within our Components segment, emission solutions and filtration have been aggregated into a single reporting unit. This
reporting unit accounts for almost 89 percent of our total goodwill balance at December 31, 2011.

•

Also within our Components segment, our turbo technologies business is considered a separate reporting unit.

•

Within our Power Generation segment, our generator technologies business is considered a separate reporting unit.

•

Within our Engine segment, our new and recon parts business is considered a separate reporting unit. This reporting unit
is in the business of selling new parts and remanufacturing and reconditioning engines and certain engine components.

•

Our Distribution segment is considered a single reporting unit as it is managed geographically and all regions share
similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services.

No
other reporting units have goodwill. Our valuation method requires us to make projections of revenue, operating expenses, working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the
reporting units over a multi-year period. Additionally, management must estimate a weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects a market rate, for each reporting unit for use as a
discount rate. The discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and, if less than the carrying value, a separate valuation of the goodwill is required to determine if
an impairment loss has occurred. In addition, we also perform a sensitivity analysis to determine how much our forecasts can fluctuate before the fair value of a reporting unit would be lower than its
carrying amount. We performed the required procedures as of the end of our fiscal third quarter and determined that our goodwill was not impaired. At December 31, 2011, our recorded goodwill
was $339 million, approximately 89 percent of which resided in the emission solutions plus filtration reporting unit. For this reporting unit, the fair value of the reporting unit
exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin. Changes in our projections or estimates, a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect or a significant increase in the
discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units and result in a future impairment of goodwill.

Software

We capitalize certain costs for software that are developed or obtained for internal use. Software costs are amortized on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives generally ranging from three to eight years. Software assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that
the carrying value may not be recoverable over the remaining lives of the assets. Upgrades and enhancements are capitalized if they result in significant modifications that enable the software to
perform tasks it was previously incapable of performing. Software maintenance, training, data conversion and business process reengineering costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.

Warranty

We charge the estimated costs of warranty programs, other than product recalls, to income at the time products are shipped to
customers. We use historical experience of warranty programs to develop the estimated liability for our various warranty programs. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency
of product recall programs, the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action or when a recall becomes probable and estimable, which generally occurs when it is announced.
The liability for these programs is reflected in the provision for warranties issued line item. We review and assess the liability for these programs on a quarterly basis. We also assess our ability
to recover certain costs from our suppliers and record a receivable from the supplier when we believe a recovery is probable. At December 31, 2011, we had $14 million of receivables
related to estimated supplier recoveries of which $7 million was included in "Trade and other receivables, net" and $7 million was included in "Other assets" on our

Consolidated Balance Sheets

. At December 31, 2010, we had $12 million of receivables related to estimated supplier recoveries of which
$7 million was included in "Trade and other receivables, net" and $5 million was included in "Other assets" on our

Consolidated Balance
Sheets

.

In
addition, we sell extended warranty coverage on most of our engines. The revenue collected is initially deferred and is recognized as revenue in proportion to the costs expected to be
incurred in performing services over the contract period. We compare the remaining deferred revenue balance quarterly to the estimated amount of future claims under extended warranty programs and
provide an additional accrual when the deferred revenue balance is less than expected future costs.

Research and Development

Our research and development program is focused on product improvements, innovations and cost reductions for our customers. Research
and development expenditures include salaries, contractor fees, building costs, utilities, administrative expenses and allocation of corporate costs and are expensed, net of contract reimbursements,
when incurred. Research and development expenses, net of contract reimbursements, were $621 million in 2011, $402 million in 2010 and $362 million in 2009. Contract reimbursements
were $75 million in 2011, $68 million in 2010 and $92 million in 2009.

Related Party Transactions

In accordance with the provisions of various joint venture agreements, we may purchase products and components from our joint ventures,
sell products and components to our joint ventures and our joint ventures may sell products and components to unrelated parties. Joint venture transfer prices to

RECENTLY ADOPTED AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted

In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended its standards related to the testing of goodwill for
impairment. The objective of this amendment is to simplify the annual goodwill impairment evaluation process. The amendment provides entities the option to first assess qualitative factors to
determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the
two-step goodwill impairment test. The two-step impairment test is now only required if an entity determines through this qualitative analysis that it is more likely than not
that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. The new rules become effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, however entities
are permitted to early adopt the standard. We elected to early adopt the standard and applied the qualitative analysis to certain reporting units in our 2011 goodwill impairment testing process.
Because the measurement of a potential impairment loss has not changed, the standard did not have a significant impact on our

Consolidated Financial
Statements

.

In
October 2009, the FASB amended its rules regarding the accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements. The objective of the amendment is to allow vendors to account for revenue
for different deliverables separately as opposed to part of a combined unit when those deliverables are provided at different times. Specifically, this amendment addresses how to separate deliverables
and simplifies the process of allocating revenue to the different deliverables when more than one deliverable exists. The new rules were effective for us beginning January 1, 2011. This
amendment did not have a significant impact on our

Consolidated Financial Statements

as multiple element arrangements are not material to our business.

In
June 2009, the FASB amended its existing standards related to the consolidation of variable interest entities, which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning
after November 15, 2009. The new standard requires entities to analyze whether their variable interests give it a controlling financial interest of a variable interest entity (VIE) and outlines
what defines a primary beneficiary. The new standard amends GAAP by: (a) changing certain rules for determining whether an entity is a VIE; (b) replacing the quantitative approach
previously required for determining the primary beneficiary with a more qualitative approach; and (c) requiring entities to continuously analyze whether they are the primary beneficiary of a
VIE among other amendments. The new standard also requires enhanced disclosures regarding an entity's involvement in a VIE. The only significant impact of the adoption of this standard was to
deconsolidate Cummins Komatsu Engine Corporation (CKEC) as of January 1, 2010 and to account for CKEC under GAAP for equity method investees. CKEC is an engine
manufacturing entity jointly owned and operated by us and our equity partner. Prior to January 1, 2010, we were deemed the primary beneficiary of this VIE due to the pricing arrangements of
purchases and the substantial volume of purchases we made from the VIE. The impact of the deconsolidation on our

Consolidated Statements of Income

was
minimal as all sales were eliminated in consolidation in the past. The most significant impacts on our

Consolidated Balance Sheets

were to



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

decrease
current assets by $9 million, decrease long-term assets by $10 million, increase investments and advances related to equity method investees by $11 million
and decrease noncontrolling interest by $11 million in 2010.

Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Effective

In December 2011, the FASB amended its standards related to offsetting assets and liabilities. This amendment requires entities to
disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar
to a master netting agreement. This information will enable users of the financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position. The new rules will become
effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. It is also required that the new disclosures are applied
retrospectively for all comparative periods presented. We do not believe this amendment will have a significant impact on our

Consolidated Financial
Statements

; however we are currently evaluating the potential impacts to our footnote disclosures.

In
June 2011, the FASB amended its rules regarding the presentation of comprehensive income. The objective of this amendment is to improve the comparability, consistency and transparency
of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income. Specifically, this amendment requires that all non-owner changes in shareholders'
equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In addition, the standard also requires disclosure of the location of
reclassification adjustments between other comprehensive income and net income on the face of the financial statements. The new rules are scheduled to become effective during interim and annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2011. In December 2011, the FASB deferred certain aspects of this standard beyond the current effective date, specifically the provisions dealing with
reclassification adjustments. Because the standard only impacts the display of comprehensive income and does not impact what is included in comprehensive income, the standard will not have a
significant impact on our

Consolidated Financial Statements

.

In
May 2011, the FASB amended its standards related to fair value measurements and disclosures. The objective of the amendment is to improve the comparability of fair value measurements
presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. Primarily this amendment changed the wording used to
describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in addition to clarifying the Board's intent about the
application of existing fair value measurement requirements. The new standard also requires additional disclosures related to fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair
value hierarchy and requires disclosure of the categorization in the hierarchy for items which are not recorded at fair value but fair value is required to be disclosed. The new rules will become
effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, we had no fair value measurements categorized within Level 3. The only
impact for us is expected to be the disclosure of the categorization in the fair value hierarchy for those items where fair value is only disclosed (primarily our debt obligations).

NOTE 2. DIVESTITURES AND ACQUISITIONS

Divestitures

In the second quarter of 2011, we sold certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business which manufactures exhaust products and
select components for emission systems for a variety of applications not core to our other product offerings. This business was historically included in our Components segment. The sales price was
$123 million. We recognized a gain on the sale of $68 million ($37 million after-tax), which included a goodwill allocation of $19 million. The gain was
excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Sales
for this business were $62 million, $171 million and $126 million in 2011 (through closing), 2010 and 2009, respectively. Operating results for this business
were approximately $9 million, $22 million and $11 million in 2011 (through closing), 2010 and 2009, respectively.

During
the fourth quarter of 2011, we sold certain assets and liabilities of our light-duty filtration business which manufactures light-duty automotive and
industrial filtration solutions. The sales price was $90 million and included a note receivable from the buyer of approximately $1 million. There are no earnouts or other contingencies
associated with the sales price. We recognized a gain on the sale of $53 million ($33 million after-tax), which included a goodwill allocation of $6 million. The gain
was excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Sales
for this business were $64 million, $74 million and $54 million in 2011 (through closing), 2010 and 2009, respectively. Operating results for this business
were approximately $13 million, $9 million and $2 million in 2011 (through closing), 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The
assets and liabilities associated with these businesses have not been reclassified and separately presented in the 2010

as they are immaterial. We have entered into supply and other agreements with the operations that represent ongoing involvement and as such, the results of these
operations have not been presented as discontinued operations.

Acquisitions

On January 4, 2010, we acquired the remaining 70 percent interest in Cummins Western Canada (CWC) from our former
principal for consideration of approximately $71 million. We formed a new partnership with a new distributor principal where we own 80 percent of
CWC and the new distributor principal owns 20 percent. The acquisition was effective on January 1, 2010. The $71 million of consideration consisted of:

acquisition
of CWC was accounted for as a business combination, with the results of the acquired entity and the goodwill included in the Distribution operating segment as of the acquisition date.
Distribution segment results also include a $12 million gain in 2010, as we were required to re-measure our pre-existing 30 percent ownership interest in CWC to
fair value in accordance with GAAP. Net sales for CWC were $390 million and $272 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively, which were approximately two percent of our consolidated sales
for both years.

We
provided a loan to our partner of approximately $8 million to fund the purchase of his 20 percent interest. The purchase transaction resulted in $8 million of
noncontrolling interest (representing our partner's 20 percent interest) which was completely offset by the $8 million receivable from our partner, reducing the noncontrolling interest
impact to zero as of the acquisition date. The interest-bearing loan is expected to be repaid over a period of three to five years. The partner also has periodic options to purchase an additional 10
to 15 percent interest in CWC up to a maximum of an additional 30 percent (total ownership not to exceed 50 percent).

In
November 2010, we purchased a majority interest in a previously independent North American distributorship. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting
and resulted in an aggregate purchase price of $27 million. The assets of the acquired business were primarily accounts receivable, inventory and fixed assets. The transaction generated
$1 million of goodwill.

The
effective tax rate for 2011 includes a net income tax benefit of $48 million (net of additional reserves for uncertain tax positions of $41 million) related to prior
year refund claims filed for additional research tax credits, as well as additional foreign income and related foreign tax credits. Our effective tax rate for 2011 also includes a net income tax
benefit of $19 million related to the release of deferred U.S. tax liabilities on foreign earnings, as a result of restructuring our foreign operations. Also included in 2011 is a discrete tax
benefit of $16 million resulting from the reduction of our unrecognized tax benefits primarily due to settlements with taxing authorities. The 2011 income tax provision also includes other
discrete tax items totaling to a $2 million net tax charge, primarily relating to the enactment of state law changes in Indiana and the United Kingdom (U.K.) as well as adjustments to our
income tax accounts based on our 2010 tax return filings.

Retained
earnings of our U.K. domiciled subsidiaries and certain Singapore, German and Indian subsidiaries are considered to be permanently reinvested. The total permanently reinvested
retained earnings and related cumulative translation adjustment balances for these entities were $1.5 billion,
$1.2 billion and $0.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These amounts were determined primarily based on book retained earnings balances
for these subsidiaries

translated
at historical rates. The determination of the deferred tax liability related to these retained earnings and cumulative translation adjustment balances which are considered to be permanently
reinvested outside the U.S. is not practicable. We may periodically repatriate a portion of these earnings to the extent we can do so essentially tax-free or at minimal tax cost.

For
our remaining subsidiary companies and joint ventures outside the U.S., we provide for the additional taxes that would be due upon the dividend distribution of the income of those
foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures assuming the full utilization of foreign tax credits. Deferred taxes on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures, including those in
China, were $222 million and $217 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We have $693 million of retained earnings and related cumulative translation
adjustments in our China operations as of December 31, 2011, and have provided a U.S. deferred tax liability of $172 million related to these earnings that will be distributed to the
U.S. in the future as well as the related translation impacts as of December 31, 2011. Earnings of our China operations for periods beginning after December 31, 2011 will be considered
to be permanently reinvested and additional U.S. deferred tax will not be provided on these future earnings. These future earnings are expected to be used for capital expenditures and to fund joint
ventures in China. During 2010, we released $3 million of U.S. deferred tax liabilities related to prior years unremitted income of certain German and Indian subsidiaries of our U.K. group now
considered to also be permanently reinvested. Income before income taxes includes equity income of foreign joint ventures of $234 million, $218 million and $117 million for the
years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. This equity income is recorded net of foreign taxes. Additional U.S. income taxes of $49 million, $50 million and
$31 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, were provided for the additional U.S. taxes that will ultimately be due upon the distribution of the
foreign joint venture equity income.

carryforward benefits include $42 million of net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2013. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the gross deferred tax assets to an
amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. The valuation allowance increased in 2011 by a net $21 million and increased in 2010 by a net $6 million. The valuation
allowance is primarily attributable to the uncertainty regarding the realization of a portion of the U.S. state and foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits. Other assets
includes deferred tax assets of $167 million and $203 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. Other liabilities and deferred revenue includes deferred tax

Included
in the December 31, 2011 and 2010, balances are $75 million and $33 million related to tax positions that, if recognized, would favorably
impact the effective tax rate in future periods. Also, we had accrued interest expense related to the unrecognized tax benefits of $7 million, $30 million and $22 million as of
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. During the years ending
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recognized $(15) million, $5 million and $4 million in net interest expense, respectively. In 2011, as a result of the settlement of certain
tax positions with tax authorities in China, we reduced our liability for unrecognized tax benefits by $39 million and the related net accrued interest of $16 million. The
$39 million reduction was fully offset by adjustments to other income tax balance sheet accounts resulting in zero net income statement impact. As the settlement with the tax authorities
included no interest or penalties being incurred, we recognized a $16 million income tax benefit in 2011 from the release of the accrued interest previously recorded related to the unrecognized
tax benefits that were settled.

Audit
outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. Although we believe that adequate provision has been made for such issues, there is the
possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on our earnings. Conversely, if these issues are resolved favorably in the future, the related provision would be
reduced, thus having a positive impact on earnings. We do not expect any significant change to our unrecognized tax benefits within the next year.

As
a result of our global operations, we file income tax returns in various jurisdictions including U.S. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. We are routinely subject to examination
by taxing authorities throughout the world, including Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, India, Mexico, the U.K. and the U.S. With few exceptions, our U.S. federal, major state and
foreign jurisdictions are no longer subject to income tax examinations for years before 2005.

NOTE 6. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

In January 2010, the FASB amended its standards related to fair value measurements and disclosures, which were effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after
December 15, 2009, except for disclosures about certain Level 3 activity which did not become effective until interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010. The new
standard requires us to disclose transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers as well as activity in Level 3 fair
value measurements. The new standard also requires a more detailed level of disaggregation of the assets and liabilities being measured as well as increased disclosures regarding inputs and valuation
techniques of the fair value measurements. The amended



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 6. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued)

standards
do not require retroactive restatement of prior periods. The adoption did not materially impact our

Consolidated Financial Statements

.

Fair
value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit
price). We utilize market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the
valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable. We primarily apply the market approach for recurring fair value measurements and utilize
the best available information. Accordingly, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. We are able to classify fair value
balances based on the observability of those inputs. The amended standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest
priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined by GAAP are as follows:

Level 1—Quoted
prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or
liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as listed equities and publicly
traded bonds.

Level 2—Pricing
inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date.
Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various
assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant
economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, can be derived from observable data or are supported by
observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this category include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as
over-the-counter forwards and options.

Level 3—Pricing
inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that
result in management's best estimate of fair value. At each balance sheet date, we perform an analysis of all instruments subject to fair value accounting under GAAP and include, in Level 3,
all of those whose fair value is based on significant unobservable inputs. At December 31, 2011, we did not have any Level 3 financial assets or liabilities, other than those in our
pension plan (see Note 12, "PENSION BENEFITS AND OTHER POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS").

The
majority of the assets and liabilities we carry at fair value are available-for-sale (AFS) securities and derivatives. AFS securities are derived from
Level 1 or Level 2 inputs. The predominance of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party
pricing services. The fair value measurement of derivatives results primarily from Level 2 inputs. Many of our derivative contracts are valued utilizing publicly available pricing data of
contracts with similar terms. In other cases, the contracts are valued using current spot market data adjusted for the appropriate current forward curves provided by



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

external
financial institutions. We participate in commodity swap contracts, currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps. When material, we adjust the values of our derivative contracts for
counter-party or our credit risk. There were no transfers into or out of Levels 2 or 3 during 2011.

The
substantial majority of our assets were valued utilizing a market approach. A description of the valuation techniques and inputs used for our Level 2 fair value measures are
as follows:

Debt mutual funds

—Assets in Level 2 consist of exchange traded mutual funds that lack sufficient trading volume to be classified at
Level 1. The fair value measure for these investments is the daily net asset value published on a regulated governmental website. Daily quoted prices are available from the issuing brokerage
and are used on a test basis to corroborate this Level 2 input.

Bank debentures and Certificates of deposit

—These investments provide us with a fixed rate of return and generally range in maturity from six months
to three years. The counter-parties to these investments are reputable financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. Since these instruments are not tradable and must be settled
directly by Cummins with the respective financial institution, our fair value measure is the financial institutions' month-end statement.

Government debt securities-non-U.S. and Corporate debt securities

—The fair value measure for these securities are broker
quotes received from reputable firms. These securities are infrequently traded on



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 6. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued)

a
national stock exchange and these values are used on a test basis to corroborate our Level 2 input measure.

Foreign currency forward contracts

—The fair value measure for these contracts are determined based on forward foreign exchange rates received from
third-party pricing services. These rates are based upon market transactions and are periodically corroborated by comparing to third-party broker quotes.

Commodity swap contracts

—The fair value measure for these contracts are current spot market data adjusted for the appropriate current forward curves
provided by external financial institutions. The current spot price is the most significant component of this valuation and is based upon market transactions. We use third-party pricing services for
the spot price component of this valuation which is periodically corroborated by market data from broker quotes.

Interest rate contracts

—We currently have only one interest rate contract. We utilize the month-end statement from the issuing financial
institution as our fair value measure for this investment. We corroborate this valuation through the use of a third-party pricing service for similar assets and liabilities.

Revolving Credit Facility

On July 16, 2010, we entered into a four-year revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders. The credit
agreement provides us with a $1.24 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, the proceeds of which are to be used by us for working capital or other general corporate purposes.

The
credit facility matures on July 16, 2014. Amounts payable under our revolving credit facility will rank pro rata with all of our unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness. Up to
$150 million under our credit facility is available for swingline loans denominated in U.S. dollars. Advances under the facility bear interest at (i) a base rate or (ii) a rate
equal to the LIBOR Rate plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of our outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt. Based on our current long-term debt ratings,
the applicable margin on LIBOR Rate loans was 1.75 percent per annum as of December 31, 2011. Advances under the facility may be prepaid without premium or penalty, subject to customary
breakage costs.

The
credit agreement includes various covenants, including, among others, maintaining a leverage ratio of no more than 3.0 to 1.0 and maintaining an interest coverage ratio of at least
1.5 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with both covenants.

The
table below is a reconciliation of the maximum capacity of our revolver to the amount available under the facility as of December 31, 2011. There were no outstanding
borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2011.

During
2010, two of our wholly-owned Brazilian subsidiaries entered into a loan agreement for a loan in local currency in an amount equivalent to US $50 million, at drawdown, at a
fixed rate of 4.5 percent to finance its exports over the next three years. The principal of the loan has a two-year grace period and will begin amortizing in 2012.

In
October 2009, one wholly-owned subsidiary, Cummins Brasil Ltda, entered into a loan agreement with the Brazil development bank, BNDES, for a loan in local currency in an amount
equivalent to US $45 million, at drawdown, at a fixed rate of 4.5 percent to finance its exports over the next three years. The principal of the loan had a two-year grace
period and began amortizing in 2011.

Our
debt agreements contain several restrictive covenants. The most restrictive of these covenants applies to our revolving credit facility which will upon default, among other things,
limit our ability to incur additional debt or issue preferred stock, enter into sale-leaseback transactions, sell or create liens on our assets, make investments and merge or consolidate
with any other person. In addition, we are subject to various financial covenants including a maximum debt-to-EBITDA ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. As of
December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our borrowing agreements.

We charge the estimated costs of warranty programs, other than product recalls, to income at the time products are shipped to customers. We use historical claims experience to develop
the estimated liability. We review product recall programs on a quarterly basis and, if necessary, record a liability when we commit to an action or when they become probable and estimable, which is
reflected in the provision for warranties issued line. We also sell extended warranty coverage on several engines. The

NOTE 12. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

PENSION PLANS

We sponsor several contributory and noncontributory pension plans covering substantially all employees. Generally, hourly employee
pension benefits are earned based on years of service and compensation during active employment while future benefits for salaried employees are determined

As
disclosed in Note 22, "RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES," we executed restructuring actions in 2009. As a result, our pension benefit plans were remeasured and we recognized
curtailment losses, as prescribed under GAAP pension standards, due to the significant reduction in the expected aggregate years of future service of the employees affected by the actions. In 2009, we
recorded net curtailment losses of $5 million and $1 million for U.S. and non-U.S. plans, respectively, and $2 million for our less significant plans in other
countries outside the U.S. and the U.K. The curtailment losses include recognition of the change in the PBO and a portion of the previously unrecognized prior service cost reflecting the reduction in
expected future service.

Plan Assets

Our investment policies in the U.S. and U.K. provide for the rebalancing of assets to maintain our long-term strategic
asset allocation. We are committed to its long-term strategy and do not attempt to time the market given empirical evidence that asset allocation is more critical than individual asset or
investment manager selection. Rebalancing of the assets has and continues to occur. The rebalancing is critical to having the proper weighting of assets to achieve the expected total portfolio
returns. We believe that our portfolio is highly diversified and does not have any significant exposure to concentration risk. The plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans do not include any
of our common stock.

U.S. Plan Assets

For the U.S. qualified pension plans, our assumption for the expected return on assets was 8.0 percent in 2011. Projected
returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management. We expect additional positive returns
from this active investment management. Based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations, we have elected to use an assumption of 8.0 percent per year beginning in 2012.

The
primary investment objective is to exceed, on a net-of-fee basis, the rate of return of a policy portfolio comprised of the following:

Asset Class

Target

Range

U.S. equities

21.0

+/-5.0

The
fixed income component is structured to represent a custom bond benchmark constructed to closely represent the monthly change in the value of our liabilities. This component is
structured in such a way that its benchmark covers approximately 70 percent of the plan's exposure to changes in its



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 12. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (Continued)

discount
rate (AA corporate bond yields). In order to achieve a hedge on more than the targeted 40 percent of plan assets invested in fixed income securities, the Benefits Policy Committee may
permit the fixed income managers, other managers or the custodian/trustee to utilize derivative securities, as part of a liability driven investment strategy to further reduce the plan's risk of
declining interest rates. However, all managers hired to manage assets for the trust are prohibited from using leverage unless specifically discussed with the committee and allowed for in their
guidelines.

U.K. Plan Assets

For the U.K. qualified pension plans, our assumption for the expected return on assets was 7.0 percent in 2011. The methodology
used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the U.K. was based on establishing an equity-risk premium over current long-term bond yields adjusted based on
target asset allocations. Our strategy with respect to our investments in these assets is to be invested in a suitable mixture of return-seeking assets (equities and real estate) and liability
matching assets (bonds) with a long-term outlook. Therefore, the risk and return balance of our U.K. asset portfolio should reflect a long-term horizon. To achieve these
objectives we have established the following targets:

As
part of our strategy in the U.K. we have not prohibited the use of any financial instrument, including derivatives. Based on the above discussion, we have elected to use our
assumption of 6.5 percent per year beginning in 2012.

The
investments in private equity and real estate funds, for which quoted market prices are not available, are valued at their estimated fair value as determined by applicable investment
managers or by quarterly financial statements of the funds. These financial statements are audited at least annually. The fair value of all real estate properties, held in the partnerships, are valued
at least once per year by an independent professional real estate valuation firm. Fair value generally represents the fund's proportionate share of the net assets of the investment partnerships as
reported by the general partners of the underlying partnerships. Some securities with no readily available market are initially valued at cost, utilizing independent professional valuation firms as
well as market comparisons with subsequent adjustments to values which reflect either the basis of meaningful third-party transactions in the private market or the fair value deemed appropriate by the
general partners of the underlying investment partnerships. In such instances, consideration is also given to the financial condition and operating results of the issuer, the amount that the
investment partnerships can reasonably expect to realize upon the sale of the securities and any other factors deemed relevant. The estimated fair values are subject to uncertainty and therefore may
differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market for such investments existed and such differences could be material.

We also sponsor defined contribution plans for certain hourly and salaried employees. Our contributions to these plans were
$72 million, $44 million and $42 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

Our other postretirement benefit plans provide various health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees, who retire and
satisfy certain age and service requirements, and their dependents. The plans are contributory and contain cost-sharing features such as caps, deductibles, coinsurance and spousal
contributions. Employer contributions are limited by formulas in each plan. Retiree contributions for health care benefits are adjusted annually and we reserve the right to change benefits covered
under these plans. There were no plan assets for the postretirement benefit plans as our policy is to fund benefits and expenses for these plans as claims and premiums are incurred.

prior service credit of $5 million and an actuarial loss of $3 million.

As
disclosed in Note 22, "RESTUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES," we executed restructuring actions in 2009. As a result, our U.S. postretirement benefit plans were remeasured and we
recognized curtailment losses, as prescribed under GAAP other postretirement benefit standards, due to the significant reduction in the expected aggregate years of future service of the employees
affected by the actions. In 2009, we recorded net curtailment losses of $6 million. The curtailment losses include recognition of the change in the APBO and a portion of the previously
unrecognized prior service cost reflecting the reduction in expected future service.

Our
consolidated other postretirement benefit obligation is determined by application of the terms of health care and life insurance plans, together with relevant actuarial assumptions
and health care cost trend rates. For measurement purposes, an 8.00 percent annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed in 2011. The rate was
assumed to remain at 8.00 percent for two years and then decrease on a linear basis to 5.00 percent through 2019 and remain at that level thereafter. An increase in the health care cost
trends of one percent would increase our APBO by $23 million as of December 31, 2011 and the net periodic other postretirement benefit expense for 2012 by $1 million. A decrease
in the health care cost trends of one percent would decrease our APBO by $19 million as of December 31, 2011 and the net periodic other postretirement benefit expense for 2012 by
$1 million.

The
Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 was reflected in the APBO beginning December 31, 2004, assuming we will continue to provide a prescription
drug benefit to retirees that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D and we will receive the federal subsidy. We received a subsidy of approximately $2 million in 2011 and
$4 million in 2010.

NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

We are subject to numerous lawsuits and claims arising out of the ordinary course of our business, including actions related to product liability; personal injury; the use and
performance of our products; warranty matters; patent, trademark or other intellectual property infringement; contractual liability; the conduct of our business; tax reporting in foreign
jurisdictions; distributor termination; workplace safety; and environmental matters. We also have been identified as a potentially responsible party at multiple waste disposal sites under U.S. federal
and related state environmental statutes and regulations and may have joint and several liability for any investigation and remediation costs incurred
with respect to such sites. We have denied liability with respect to many of these lawsuits, claims and proceedings and are vigorously defending such lawsuits, claims and proceedings. We carry various
forms of commercial, property and casualty, product liability and other forms of insurance; however, such insurance may not be applicable or adequate to cover the costs associated with a judgment
against us with respect to these lawsuits, claims and proceedings. We do not believe that these lawsuits are material individually or in the aggregate. While we believe we have also established
adequate accruals for our expected future liability with respect to pending lawsuits, claims and proceedings, where the nature and extent of any such liability can be reasonably estimated based upon
then presently available information, there can be no assurance that the final resolution of any existing or future lawsuits, claims or proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

We
conduct significant business operations in Brazil that are subject to the Brazilian federal, state and local labor, social security, tax and customs laws. While we believe we comply
with such laws, they are complex, subject to varying interpretations and we are often engaged in litigation regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances. In 2010, it was
determined that we overpaid a Brazilian revenue based tax during the period 2004-2008. Our results include a recovery of $32 million recorded in cost of sales ($21 million
after-tax) related to tax credits on imported products arising from an overpayment. This recovery has been excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of
operating results for the year.

In
June 2008, four of our sites in Southern Indiana, including our Technical Center, experienced extensive flood damage. In October 2011, we received $40 million from our
insurance carriers to settle all outstanding 2008 flood claims. As a result, we recognized a gain of approximately $38 million ($24 million after-tax), net of any remaining
flood related expenses, in "Other operating (expense) income, net" in our

U.S. Distributor Commitments

Our distribution agreements with independent and partially-owned distributors generally have a renewable three-year term
and are restricted to specified territories. Our distributors develop and maintain a network of dealers with which we have no direct relationship. Our distributors are permitted to sell other,
noncompetitive products only with our consent. We license all of our distributors to use our name and logo in connection with the sale and service of our products, with no right to assign or
sublicense the trademarks, except to authorized dealers, without our consent. Products are sold to the distributors at standard domestic or international distributor net prices, as applicable. Net
prices are wholesale prices we establish to permit our distributors an adequate margin on their sales. Subject to local laws, we can generally refuse to renew these agreements upon expiration or
terminate them upon written notice for inadequate sales, change in principal ownership and certain other reasons. Distributors also have the right to terminate the agreements upon 60-day
notice without cause, or

30-day
notice for cause. Upon termination or failure to renew, we are required to purchase the distributor's current inventory, signage and special tools, and may, at our option purchase
other assets of the distributor, but are under no obligation to do so.

Other Guarantees and Commitments

In addition to the matters discussed above, from time to time we enter into other guarantee arrangements, including guarantees of
non-U.S. distributor financing, residual value guarantees on equipment under operating leases and other miscellaneous guarantees of third-party obligations. As of December 31, 2011,
the maximum potential loss related to these other guarantees is $45 million ($18 million of which relates to the Beijing Foton guarantee discussed below and $19 million relates to
the Cummins Olayan Energy Limited guarantee discussed below).

We
have arrangements with certain suppliers that require us to purchase minimum volumes or be subject to monetary penalties. The penalty amounts are less than our purchase commitments
and essentially allow the supplier to recover their tooling costs in most instances. As of December 31, 2011, if we were to stop purchasing from each of these suppliers, the aggregate amount of
the penalty would be approximately $40 million, of which $39 million relates to a contract with an engine parts supplier that extends to 2013. We do not currently anticipate paying any
penalties under these contracts. In addition, we also have a "take or pay" contract with an emission solutions business supplier requiring us to purchase approximately $73 million annually from
2012 through 2018. These arrangements enable us to secure critical components.

In
July 2008, Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Company, a 50 percent owned entity accounted for under the equity method, entered into a line of credit agreement with a borrowing
capacity of up to $190 million (at current exchange rates). The line was used primarily to fund equipment purchases for a new manufacturing plant which went into production in June 2009. As a
part of this transaction, we guaranteed 50 percent of any outstanding borrowings up to a maximum guarantee of $95 million (at current exchange rates). A portion of this debt was
collateralized in April 2011 by the assets of BFCEC and no longer requires partner guarantees. As of December 31, 2011, outstanding borrowings under this agreement were $129 million and
our guarantee was $18 million (at current exchange rates). We recorded a liability for the fair value of this guarantee. The amount of the liability was less than $1 million. The offset
to this liability was an increase in our investment in the joint venture.

In
February 2010, Cummins Olayan Energy Limited, a 49 percent owned entity accounted for under the equity method, executed a four-year $101 million (at current
exchange rates) debt
financing arrangement to acquire certain rental equipment assets. As a part of this transaction, we guaranteed 49 percent of the total outstanding loan amount or $50 million (at current
exchange rates). As of December 31, 2011, outstanding borrowings under this agreement were $39 million and our guarantee was $19 million (at current exchange rates). We recorded a
liability for the fair value of this guarantee. The amount of the liability was less than $1 million. The offset to this liability was an increase in our investment in the joint venture.

We
have guarantees with certain customers that require us to satisfactorily honor contractual or regulatory obligations, or compensate for monetary losses related to nonperformance.
These performance bonds and other performance-related guarantees were $81 million and $78 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Indemnities

Periodically, we enter into various contractual arrangements where we agree to indemnify a third-party against certain types of losses.
Common types of indemnities include:

•

product liability and license, patent or trademark indemnifications,

•

asset sale agreements where we agree to indemnify the purchaser against future environmental exposures related to the
asset sold and

•

any contractual agreement where we agree to indemnify the counter-party for losses suffered as a result of a
misrepresentation in the contract.

We
regularly evaluate the probability of having to incur costs associated with these indemnities and accrue for expected losses that are probable. Because the indemnities are not related
to specified known liabilities and due to their uncertain nature, we are unable to estimate the maximum amount of the potential loss associated with these indemnifications.

Joint Venture Commitments

As of December 31, 2011, we have committed to invest an additional $82 million into existing joint ventures with
$74 million to be funded in 2012.

Leases

We lease certain manufacturing equipment, facilities, warehouses, office space and equipment, aircraft and automobiles for varying
periods under lease agreements. Most of the leases are non-cancelable operating leases with fixed rental payments, expire over the next ten years and contain renewal provisions. Rent

Sale and Leaseback Transaction Amendment and Extension

During 2001, we entered into a sale-leaseback transaction with a financial institution with regard to certain
heavy-duty engine manufacturing equipment. The lease was classified as an operating lease with a lease term of 11.5 years, expiring June 28, 2013. The financial institution
created a grantor trust to act as the lessor in the arrangement. The financial institution owns all of the equity in the trust. The grantor trust has no assets other than the equipment and its rights
to the lease agreement with us. The terms of the agreement contained a guarantee of the residual value of the equipment and in December 2003, the grantor trust (which acted as the lessor in the sale
and leaseback transaction described above) was consolidated as a result of the adoption of new accounting standards for VIEs, due primarily to the existence of the residual value guarantee.

In
February 2009, we amended the lease agreement to extend the lease for an additional two years to June 2015 and we removed the residual value guarantee. As a result of removing the
residual value guarantee, we were no longer required to consolidate the grantor trust and we deconsolidated the trust in the first quarter of 2009. With the deconsolidation, we were required to
account for the leasing arrangement with the trust as a capital lease. The deconsolidation of the trust had minimal impact on our

Consolidated Financial
Statements

as the present value of the minimum lease payments (including the extension) approximated the amount that was reported as noncontrolling interest as of the date of
the amendment. The reduction in noncontrolling interests and increase in our capital lease liabilities was $35 million.

In
September 2011, we purchased the leased assets from the lessor for approximately $48 million. The amount exceeded the existing capital lease obligation by approximately
$14 million. This excess was recorded as an increase to the book value of those assets and is being depreciated over the estimated remaining useful life of approximately 10 years.

Total
dividends paid to common shareholders in 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $255 million, $172 million and $141 million, respectively. Declaration and payment of
dividends in the future depends upon our income and liquidity position, among other factors, and is subject to declaration by our Board of Directors, who meet quarterly to consider our dividend
payment. We expect to fund dividend payments with cash from operations.

Employee Benefits Trust

In 1997, we established the Employee Benefits Trust (EBT) funded with common stock for use in meeting our future obligations under
employee benefit and compensation plans. The primary sources of cash for the EBT are dividends received on unallocated shares of our common stock held by the EBT. The EBT may be used to fund matching
contributions to employee accounts in the 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) made in proportion to employee contributions under the terms of the RSP. In addition, we may direct the trustee to sell
shares of the EBT on the open market to fund other non-qualified employee benefit plans. Matching contributions charged to income for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and
2009 were $28 million, $21 million and $13 million, respectively. EBT shares sold on the open market and proceeds from those sales for the years ended December 31, 2011 and

Employee Stock Ownership Plan

Our ESOP Trust was established in 1989 for certain domestic salaried and non-bargained employees participating in our RSP.
The ESOP had a note payable to us which was funded through future employer contributions to the ESOP Trust. In 2010, the debt was repaid and the ESOP became an unleveraged plan. There was no activity
related to the ESOP Trust for the year ended December 31, 2011.

During
the plan years of 2010 and 2009, our total annual cash contributions and cash contributions from the EBT were $2 million and $10 million, respectively. These
contributions were equal to the required principal and interest payments due under the ESOP notes. Dividends received on allocated ESOP shares were used to purchase shares of our common stock from the
EBT. Those shares were allocated to the participant accounts. Compensation expense was recorded as shares were allocated to plan participants each year and reduced by the common stock dividends
received by the ESOP Trust. Annual compensation expense for the plan years of 2010 and 2009 were $1 million and $4 million, respectively. Unearned compensation was included in
Cummins Inc. shareholders' equity and represented compensation expense which was recorded as the remaining shares were allocated to participants. All shares issued to the ESOP Trust were
considered outstanding for purposes of computing earnings per share.

NOTE 17. STOCK INCENTIVE AND STOCK OPTION PLANS

In September 2003, our shareholders approved the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan (the Plan), which replaced and succeeded the 1993 Stock Incentive Plan. The Plan, as amended most recently in
January 2010, allows for the granting of up to 13.5 million stock-based awards to executives and employees, of which one-half must be in the form of stock options or stock
appreciation rights. Awards available for grant under the Plan include, but are not limited to, stock options, stock appreciation rights and stock awards.

Stock
options are generally granted with a strike price equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant, a life of 10 years and a two-year vesting
period. The strike price may be higher than the fair value of the stock on the date of the grant, but cannot be lower. Compensation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period beginning on the grant date. The compensation expense is based on the fair value of each option grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Options granted to employees eligible
for retirement under our retirement plan are fully expensed as of the grant date.

Stock
options are also awarded through the Key Employee Stock Investment Plan (KESIP) which allows certain employees, other than officers, to purchase shares of common stock on an
installment basis up to an established credit limit. Fifty stock options are granted for every even block of 100 KESIP shares purchased by the employee. The options granted through the KESIP program
are considered awards under the Plan and are vested immediately. Compensation expense for stock options granted through the KESIP program is recorded based on the fair value of each option grant using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

Performance
shares are granted as target awards and are earned based on our return on equity (ROE) performance. A payout factor has been established ranging from zero to
200 percent of the target award based on our actual ROE performance during a two-year performance period, for grants prior to 2011, and during a three-year performance
period, for grants in 2011. Any shares earned under grants prior to 2011 are then restricted for one additional year. Employees leaving the company prior to the end of the restriction period forfeit
any shares subject to the restriction period. Shares earned under grants in 2011 are not restricted for one year after they are earned because the performance period is three years. Compensation
expense is recorded ratably over the period beginning on the grant date until the shares become unrestricted and is based on the amount of the award that is expected to be earned under the plan
formula, adjusted each reporting period based on current information.

Restricted
common stock is awarded from time to time at no cost to certain employees. Participants are entitled to cash dividends and voting rights. Restrictions limit the sale or
transfer of the shares during a defined period. Generally, one-third of the shares become vested and free from restrictions after two years and one-third of the shares issued
become vested and free from restrictions each year thereafter on the anniversary of the grant date, provided the participant remains an employee. Compensation expense is determined at the grant date
and is recognized over the four-year restriction period on a straight-line basis.

Compensation
expense (net of estimated forfeitures) related to our share-based plans for the year ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was approximately $40 million,
$20 million and $20 million, respectively. The excess tax benefit/(deficiency) associated with our share-based plans for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, was
$5 million, $10 million and $(1) million, respectively. The total unrecognized compensation expense (net of estimated forfeitures) related to nonvested

NOTE 19. EARNINGS PER SHARE

We calculate basic earnings per share (EPS) of common stock by dividing net income attributable to Cummins Inc. by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the
period. The calculation of diluted EPS assumes the issuance of common stock for all potentially dilutive share equivalents outstanding. We exclude shares of common stock held in the EBT (see
Note 15, "SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY") from the calculation of the weighted-average common shares outstanding until those shares are distributed from the EBT to the RSP. Following are the
computations for basic and diluted earnings per share:

NOTE 20. DERIVATIVES

We are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. This risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of
financial derivative instruments including foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swap contracts and interest rate swaps. As stated in our policies and procedures, financial derivatives are
used expressly for hedging purposes, and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes. When material, we adjust the value of our derivative contracts for counter-party or our credit
risk.

Foreign Exchange Rates

As a result of our international business presence, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks. We transact business in foreign
currencies and, as a result, our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. To help manage our exposure to exchange rate volatility, we use foreign
exchange forward contracts on a regular basis to hedge forecasted intercompany and third-party sales and purchases denominated in non-functional currencies. Our internal policy allows for
managing anticipated foreign currency cash flows for up to one year. These foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges under GAAP. The effective
portion of the unrealized gain or loss on the forward contract is deferred and reported as a component of "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" (AOCL). When the hedged forecasted transaction (sale or
purchase) occurs, the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction
affects income. The ineffective portion of the hedge, unrealized gain or loss, if any, is recognized in current income during the period of change. As of December 31, 2011, the amount we expect
to reclassify from AOCL to income over the next year is an unrealized net loss of $6 million. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, there were no circumstances that would have
resulted in the discontinuance of a foreign currency cash flow hedge.

To
minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, we enter into foreign
currency forward contracts, which are considered economic hedges. The objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward
contract. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under GAAP.

The
table below summarizes our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts. Only the U.S. dollar forward contracts are designated and qualify for hedge accounting as of each period
presented

Commodity Price Risk

We are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers. In order to protect
ourselves against future price volatility and, consequently, fluctuations in gross margins, we periodically enter into commodity swap contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw
material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations. Certain commodity swap contracts are derivative contracts that are designated as cash
flow hedges under GAAP. We also have commodity swap contracts that represent an economic hedge, however do not qualify for hedge accounting and are marked to market through earnings. For those
contracts that qualify for hedge accounting, the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss is deferred and reported as a component of AOCL. When the
hedged forecasted transaction (purchase) occurs, the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods
during which the hedged transaction affects income. The ineffective portion of the hedge, if any, is recognized in current income in the period in which the ineffectiveness occurs. As of
December 31, 2011, we expect to reclassify an unrealized net loss of $11 million from AOCL to income over the next year. Our internal policy allows for managing these cash flow hedges
for up to three years.

The
following table summarizes our outstanding commodity swap contracts that were entered into to hedge the cost of certain raw material purchases:

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. We manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use
of interest rate swaps. The objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk.

In
November 2005, we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert our $250 million debt issue, due in 2028, from a fixed rate of 7.125 percent to a floating
rate based on a LIBOR spread. The terms of the swap mirror those of the debt, with interest paid semi-annually. This swap qualifies as a fair value hedge under GAAP. The gain or loss on
this derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current income as "Interest expense." The following table
summarizes these gains and losses for the years presented below:

NOTE 21. SALES OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

We have a trade receivables facility (subject to renewal annually) with a financial institution to sell trade receivables from time to time to Cummins Trade Receivables, LLC
(CTR), a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary, for the purpose of obtaining credit secured by such receivables from one or more commercial paper conduit and committed institutional lenders. To
support outstanding advances under the agreement, we sell new receivables to CTR as they arise. Receivables sold to CTR are included in "Receivables, net" on our

Consolidated
Balance Sheets

. The amount of aggregate advances that can be outstanding under the agreement at any point in time is limited to the lesser of $250 million or, with
certain adjustments, the amount of eligible receivables held by CTR. There are no provisions in the agreement that require us to maintain a minimum investment credit rating; however, the terms of the
agreement contain the same financial covenants as our revolving credit facility. In accordance with FASB Standards for transfer of financial assets, any activity under our receivable sales program
will be accounted for as secured borrowings. As of December 31, 2011, the amount available under the agreement was $209 million and no advances were outstanding under the agreement.

CTR
is a separate legal entity from Cummins Inc. and each of its affiliates and its assets and credit are not available to satisfy our debts or obligations or the debts and
obligations of any other entity. CTR's assets are listed separately on its balance sheet on a stand-alone basis. CTR's assets will be available first and foremost to satisfy claims of its creditors.

NOTE 22. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES

2009 Restructuring Actions

In 2009, we executed restructuring actions in response to a reduction in orders in most of our U.S. and foreign markets due to the
deterioration in the global economy. We reduced our global workforce by approximately 1,000 professional employees. In addition, we took numerous employee actions at many of our manufacturing
locations, including approximately
3,200 hourly employees, significant downsizing at numerous facilities and complete closure of several facilities and branch distributor locations. Employee termination and severance costs were
recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans, union contracts or
statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan. Estimates of restructuring costs were made based on information available at the time charges were recorded.

In
response to closures and downsizing noted above, we incurred $2 million of restructuring expenses for lease terminations and $5 million of restructuring expenses for
asset impairments. During 2009, we recorded a total pre-tax restructuring charge of $85 million, comprising $90 million of charges related to 2009 actions net of the
$3 million favorable change in estimate related to 2008 actions and the $2 million favorable change in estimate related to earlier 2009 actions, in "Restructuring and other charges" in

NOTE 23. OPERATING SEGMENTS

Operating segments under GAAP are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating
decision-maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Cummins chief operating decision-maker (CODM) is the Chief Executive Officer.

Our
reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Components, Power Generation and Distribution. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and
markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers
in on-highway and various industrial markets. Our engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well as in various industrial applications, including
construction, mining,



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 23. OPERATING SEGMENTS (Continued)

agriculture,
marine, oil and gas, rail and military equipment. The Components segment sells filtration products, exhaust aftertreatment systems, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Power Generation
segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines, generator sets and alternators. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in
wholesaling engines, generator sets and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMs throughout the world.

We
use segment EBIT (defined as earnings before interest expense, taxes and noncontrolling interests) as a primary basis for the CODM to evaluate the performance of each of our operating
segments. Segment amounts exclude certain expenses not specifically identifiable to segments.

The
accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those applied in our

Consolidated Financial Statements

. We prepared the
financial results of our operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We
have allocated certain common costs and expenses, primarily corporate functions, among segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). These include certain costs and expenses of shared services, such as information technology, human resources, legal and finance.
We also do not allocate debt-related items, actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, changes in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance, restructuring and
other charges, flood damage gains or losses, or income taxes to individual segments. In 2011 non-segment items included the gain on disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our
exhaust business and our light-duty filtration business while 2010 included a Brazil revenue tax recovery. These gains were not allocated to the businesses as they were not considered in
our evaluation of operating results for the year. Segment EBIT may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.

For
the year ended December 31, 2011, net income includes a $68 million gain ($37 million after-tax) related to the
disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and a $53 million gain ($33 million after-tax) recorded for the disposition of certain assets and
liabilities of our light-duty filtration business, both from the Components segment, and a $38 million gain ($24 million after-tax) related to flood damage
recoveries from the insurance settlement related to a June 2008 flood in Southern Indiana. For the year ended December 31, 2010, net income includes $32 million in Brazil tax recoveries
($21 million after-tax) and $2 million in flood damage expenses.

(2)

Earnings
per share in each quarter is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during that quarter while earnings per share for the
full year is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the year. Thus, the sum of the four quarters earnings per share does not equal the full year earnings per share.

At
December 31, 2011, there were approximately 3,942 holders of record of Cummins Inc.'s $2.50 par value common stock.
