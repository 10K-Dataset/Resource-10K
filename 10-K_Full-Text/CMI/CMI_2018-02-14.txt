SUPPLY

The performance of the end-to-end supply chain, extending through to our suppliers, is foundational to our ability to meet customers' expectations and support long-term growth. We are committed to having a robust strategy for how we select and manage our suppliers to enable a market focused supply chain. This requires us to continuously evaluate and upgrade our supply base, as necessary, to ensure we are meeting the needs of our customers.

We use a category strategy process (a process designed to create the most value for the company) that reviews our long-term needs and guides decisions on what we make internally and what we purchase externally. For the items we decide to purchase externally, the strategies also identify the suppliers we should partner with long-term to provide the best technology, the lowest total cost and highest supply chain performance. We design and/or manufacture our strategic components used in or with our engines and power generation units, including cylinder blocks and heads, turbochargers, connecting rods, camshafts, crankshafts, filters, alternators, electronic and emissions controls, and fuel systems. We source externally purchased material and manufactured components from leading global suppliers. Many key suppliers are managed through long-term supply agreements that assure capacity, delivery, quality and cost requirements are met over an extended period. Approximately


percent of the direct material in our product designs are single sourced to external suppliers. We have an established sourcing strategy and supplier management process to evaluate and mitigate risk. These processes are leading us to determine our need for dual sourcing and increase our use of dual and parallel sources to minimize risk and increase supply chain responsiveness. Our current target for dual and parallel sourcing is approximately

90 percent

of our direct material spend. As of

December 31, 2017

, our analysis indicates that we have approximately

80 percent

of direct material spend with dual or parallel sources or

89 percent

of our target.

Other important elements of our sourcing strategy include:

•

working with suppliers to measure and improve their environmental footprint;

•

selecting and managing suppliers to comply with our supplier code of conduct; and

•

assuring our suppliers comply with Cummins' prohibited and restricted materials policy.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

We own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture. These patents and trademarks were granted and registered over a period of years. Although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations, we do not believe any patent, group of patents or trademark (other than our leading brand house trademarks) is significant to our business.

SEASONALITY

While individual product lines may experience modest seasonal variation in production, there is no material effect on the demand for the majority of our products on a quarterly basis with the exceptions that our Power Systems segment normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter due to general declines in construction spending during this period and our Distribution segment normally experiences seasonal declines in its first quarter business activity due to holiday periods in Asia and Australia.

LARGEST CUSTOMERS

We have thousands of customers around the world and have developed long-standing business relationships with many of them. PACCAR is our largest customer, accounting for 14 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2017, 13 percent in 2016 and 15 percent in 2015. We have long-term supply agreements with PACCAR for our heavy-duty ISX 15 liter and ISX 11.9 liter engines and our mid-range ISL 9 liter engine. While a significant number of our sales to PACCAR are under long-term supply agreements, these agreements provide for particular engine requirements for specific vehicle models and not a specific volume of engines. PACCAR is our only customer accounting for more than 10 percent of our net sales in 2017. The loss of this customer or a significant decline in the production level of PACCAR vehicles that use our engines would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We have been an engine supplier to PACCAR for 73 years. A summary of principal customers for each operating segment is included in our segment discussion.

In addition to our agreement with PACCAR, we have long-term heavy-duty engine supply agreements with Daimler and Navistar and a long-term mid-range supply agreement with Daimler. We also have an agreement with Fiat Chrysler to supply engines for its Ram trucks.

Collectively, our net sales to these four customers, including PACCAR, were 33 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2017

, 33 percent in 2016 and 36 percent in 2015.

Excluding PACCAR, net sales to any single



customer were less than 7 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2017

, less than 7 percent in 2016 and less than 9 percent in 2015.

These agreements contain standard purchase and sale agreement terms covering engine and engine parts pricing, quality and delivery commitments, as well as engineering product support obligations. The basic nature of our agreements with OEM customers is that they are long-term price and operations agreements that help assure the availability of our products to each customer through the duration of the respective agreements. Agreements with most OEMs contain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach, change of control or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party.

BACKLOG

We have supply agreements with some truck and off-highway equipment OEMs, however most of our business is transacted through open purchase orders. These open orders are historically subject to month-to-month releases and are subject to cancellation on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm. At

December 31, 2017

, we did not have any significant backlogs.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

In


, we continued to invest in future critical technologies and products. We will continue to make investments to improve our current technologies, meet the future emission requirements around the world and improve fuel economy.

Our research and development program is focused on product improvements, product extensions, innovations and cost reductions for our customers. Research and development expenditures include salaries, contractor fees, building costs, utilities, testing, technical IT, administrative expenses and allocation of corporate costs and are expensed, net of contract reimbursements, when incurred. From time to time, we enter into agreements with customers and government agencies to fund a portion of the research and development costs of a particular project. We generally account for these reimbursements as an offset to the related research and development expenditure. Research and development expenses, net of contract reimbursements, were

$734 million

in 2017,

$616 million

ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY

We adopted our comprehensive environmental sustainability plan in 2014 after examining our entire environmental footprint, focusing on the key areas of water, waste, energy and greenhouse gases (GHG). As the concept and scope of environmental sustainability has matured and broadened, leaders have moved from initially working on environmental impacts within our direct control in our operations to an expanded view of fuel and raw materials that reaches across the entire product life-cycle from design to manufacture to end of life. Our environmental sustainability plan is the way we carry out our priorities, goals and initiatives in our action areas, including reducing our carbon footprint, using fewer natural resources and partnering to solve complex problems.

Our Sustainability Report for 2016/2017 including goal progress and prior reports as well as a Data Book of more detailed environmental data in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative's Standard core compliance designation are available on our website at

www.cummins.com

, although such reports and data book are not incorporated into this Form 10-K. We currently have the following environmental sustainability goals and commitments:

•

a new product vision statement — "powering the future through product innovation that makes people's lives better and reduces our environmental footprint;"

•

partnering with customers to improve the fuel efficiency of our products in use, targeting an annual run-rate reduction of 3.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and saving 350 million gallons of fuel by 2020;

•

achieving a 32 percent energy intensity reduction from company facilities by 2020 (using a baseline year of 2010) and increasing the portion of electricity we use derived from renewable sources;

•

reducing direct water use by 50 percent adjusted for hours worked and achieving water neutrality at 15 sites by 2020;

•

increasing our recycling rate from 88 percent to 95 percent and achieving zero disposal at 30 sites by 2020; and



•

utilizing the most efficient methods and modes to move goods across our network to reduce carbon dioxide per kilogram of goods moved by 10 percent by 2020.

We continue to articulate our positions on key public policy issues and on a wide range of environmental issues. We are actively engaged with regulatory, industry and other stakeholder groups around the world as GHG and fuel efficiency standards become more prevalent globally. We were named in the Top 25 in Newsweek's 2017 Green Ranking of U.S. companies, while also being named "Best in Industry" in the "Machinery" category for U.S. Companies, as well as named to the Dow Jones North American Sustainability Index for the twelfth consecutive year in 2017 and rated AAA by MSCI ESG Research, included in the “Disclosure Leadership Index” of the Carbon Disclosure Project’s climate report in 2015.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

Product Certification and Compliance

We strive to have robust certification and compliance processes, adhering to all emissions regulations worldwide, including prohibiting the use of defeat devices in all of our products. We are transparent with all governing bodies in these processes, from disclosure of the design and operation of the emission control system, to test processes and results, and later to any necessary reporting and corrective action processes if required.

We work collaboratively and proactively with emission regulators globally to ensure emission standards are clear, appropriately stringent and enforceable, in an effort to ensure our products deliver on our commitments to our customers and the environment in real world use every day.

Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing emission and noise. Over the past several years we have substantially increased our global environmental compliance presence and expertise to understand and meet emerging product environmental regulations around the world. Our ability to comply with these and future emission standards is an essential element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets. We have made, and will continue to make, significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards. Our failure to comply with these standards could result in adverse effects on our future financial results.

EU and EPA Engine Certifications

The current on-highway NOx and PM emission standards came into effect in the European Union (EU) on January 1, 2013, (Euro VI) and on January 1, 2010, for the EPA. To meet the more stringent heavy-duty on-highway emission standards, we used an evolution of our proven selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) technology solutions and refined them for the EU and EPA certified engines to maintain power and torque with substantial fuel economy improvement and maintenance intervals comparable with our previous compliant engines. We offer a complete lineup of on-highway engines to meet the near-zero emission standards. Mid-range and heavy-duty engines for EU and EPA require NOx aftertreatment. NOx reduction is achieved by an integrated technology solution comprised of the XPI High Pressure Common Rail fuel system, SCR technology, next-generation cooled EGR, advanced electronic controls, proven air handling and the Cummins Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). The EU, EPA and California Air Resources Board (CARB) have certified that our engines meet the current emission requirements. Emission standards in international markets, including Japan, Mexico, Australia, Brazil, Russia, India and China are becoming more stringent. We believe that our experience in meeting the EU and EPA emission standards leaves us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emission control capability grows.

In 2013, we certified to EPA's first ever GHG regulations for on-highway medium- and heavy-duty engines. Additionally, the EPA 2013 regulations added the requirement of on-board diagnostics, which were introduced on the ISX15 in 2010, across the full on-highway product line while maintaining the same near-zero emission levels of NOx and particulate matter required in 2010. On-board diagnostics provide enhanced service capability with standardized diagnostic trouble codes, service tool interface, in-cab warning lamp and service information availability. The new GHG and fuel-efficiency regulations were required for all heavy-duty diesel and natural gas engines beginning in January 2014. Our GHG certification was the first engine certificate issued by the EPA and uses the same proven base engine with the XPI fuel system, variable geometry turbocharger (VGT

TM

) and Cummins aftertreatment system with DPF and SCR technology. Application of these engines and aftertreatment technologies continues in our products that comply with the 2017 GHG regulations.

The current off-highway emission standards for EPA and EU came into effect between the 2013 - 2015 time frame for all power categories. These engines were designed for Tier 4 / Stage 4 standards and were based on our extensive on-highway experience developing SCR, high pressure fuel systems, DPF and VGT

TM

. Our products offer low fuel consumption, high torque rise and power output, extended maintenance intervals, reliable and durable operation and a long life to overhaul period, all while



meeting the most stringent emission standards in the industrial market. Our off-highway products power multiple applications including construction, mining, marine, agriculture, rail, defense and oil and gas and serves a global customer base.

Other Environmental Statutes and Regulations

Expenditures for environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the U.S. have not been a substantial portion of our annual expenses and are not expected to be material in


. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations.

In the U.S., pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies and/or defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions, we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended or similar state laws, at fewer than 20 waste disposal sites.

Based upon our experiences at similar sites we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be material. We have established accruals that we believe are adequate for our expected future liability with respect to these sites. In addition, we have several other sites where we are working with governmental authorities on remediation projects. The costs for these remediation projects are not expected to be material.

EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 58,600 persons worldwide. Approximately 20,830 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2018 and 2022.

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT

Following are the names and ages of our executive officers, their positions with us at January 31,


and summaries of their backgrounds and business experience:



Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is elected annually by our Board of Directors and holds office until the meeting of the Board of Directors at which his election is next considered. Other officers are appointed by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, are ratified by our Board of Directors and hold office for such period as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors may prescribe.



ITEM 1A.    Risk Factors

Set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this Report and could individually, or in combination, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. These risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this Report, including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Our separate section above, "CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION," should be considered in addition to the following statements.

A sustained slowdown or significant downturn in our markets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Many of our on- and off-highway markets are cyclical in nature and experience volatility in demand throughout these cycles. Although in 2017 we experienced demand growth in most of our North American and Chinese on-highway markets and certain off-highway markets as well as growth in many of our international markets, if the North American or Chinese markets suffer a significant downturn or if a slower pace of economic growth and weaker demand in our other significant international markets were to occur, depending upon the length, duration and severity of the slowdown, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows would likely be materially adversely affected.

Our truck manufacturers and OEM customers may discontinue outsourcing their engine supply needs.

Several of our engine customers, including PACCAR, Volvo , Navistar, Fiat Chrysler, Daimler and Dongfeng, are truck manufacturers or OEMs that manufacture engines for some of their own vehicles. Despite their own engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products, our emission compliance capabilities, our systems integration, their customers' preferences, their desire for cost reductions, their desire for eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus. However, there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource, or outsource as much of, their engine production in the future. In fact, several of these customers have expressed their intention to significantly increase their own engine production and to decrease engine purchases from us. In addition, increased levels of OEM vertical integration could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers' business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. Any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or OEM customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

The development of new technologies may materially reduce the demand for our current products and services.

We are investing in new products and technologies, including electrified powertrains, for planned introduction into certain existing and new markets.  Given the early stages of development of some of these new products and technologies, there can be no guarantee of the future market acceptance and investment returns with respect to these planned products.  The increased adoption of electrified powertrains in some market segments could result in lower demand for current diesel or natural gas engines and components and, over time, reduce the demand for related parts and service revenues from diesel or natural gas powertrains. Furthermore, it is possible that we may not be successful in developing segment-leading electrified powertrains and some of our existing customers could choose to develop their own electrified or alternate fuel powertrains, or source from other manufacturers, and any of these factors could materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

The discovery of any significant additional problems with our engine platforms or aftertreatment systems in North America could further materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

During 2017, the CARB and U.S. EPA selected certain of our pre-2013 model year engine systems for additional emissions testing. Some of these engine systems failed CARB and EPA's tests as a result of degradation of an aftertreatment component. We have not been issued an official notice from the CARB or EPA regarding these particular engine systems. We are working with the agencies and will meet with them beginning in the first quarter of 2018, to develop a resolution of these matters. We are developing and testing a variety of solutions to address the technical issues, which could include a combination of calibration changes, service practices and hardware changes.

In addition, we continue to evaluate other engine systems for model years 2010 through 2015 that could potentially be subject to similar aftertreatment component degradation issues.  At the close of 2017, we had not yet determined the impact to other model years or engine systems or the percentage of the engine system populations that could be affected.



Since there are many unresolved variables with respect to these degradation issues, we are not yet able to estimate the financial impact of these matters. It is possible that they could have a material impact on our results of operations in the periods in which these degradation issues are resolved and a solution is determined.

Our products are subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues.

Our products may be subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. Product recalls subject us to harm to our reputation, loss of current and future customers, reduced revenue and product recall costs. Product recall costs are incurred when we decide, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue. Any significant product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

See Note

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

" to the

Consolidated Financial Statements

for additional information.

Lower-than-anticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products or services, including reductions in demand for diesel engines, could materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Although we conduct market research before launching new or refreshed engines and introducing new services, many factors both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing products and services in the marketplace. Offering engines and services that customers desire and value can mitigate the risks of increasing price competition and declining demand, but products and services that are perceived to be less than desirable (whether in terms of price, quality, overall value, fuel efficiency or other attributes) can exacerbate these risks. With increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet, social media and other media, mere allegations relating to poor quality, safety, fuel efficiency, corporate responsibility or other key attributes can negatively impact our reputation or market acceptance of our products or services, even if such allegations prove to be inaccurate or unfounded.

A slowdown in infrastructure development and/or depressed commodity prices could adversely affect our business.

Infrastructure development and strong commodity prices have been significant drivers of our historical growth, but as the pace of investment in infrastructure slowed in recent years (especially in China and Brazil), commodity prices were significantly lower and demand for our products in off-highway markets was weak. Weakness in commodities, such as oil, gas and coal, adversely impacted mining industry participants’ demand for vehicles and equipment that contain our engines and other products over the past several years. Although many of our off-highway markets began to recover in 2017, additional deterioration, or renewed weakness, in infrastructure and commodities markets could adversely affect our customers’ demand for vehicles and equipment and could adversely affect our business.

Unpredictability in the adoption, implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards by multiple jurisdictions around the world could adversely affect our business.

Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emission and noise, including standards imposed by the EPA, the EU, state regulatory agencies (such as the CARB) and other regulatory agencies around the world. We have made, and will be required to continue to make, significant capital and research expenditures to ensure our engines comply with these emission standards. Developing engines and components to meet numerous changing government regulatory requirements, with different implementation timelines and emission requirements, makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets. In some cases, we are required to develop new products to comply with new regulations, particularly those relating to air emissions. While we have met previous deadlines, our ability to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our competitive advantage in the engine markets we serve. The successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks, such as delays in product development, cost over-runs and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties.

In addition to these risks, the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards in emerging markets are unpredictable and subject to change. Any delays in implementation or enforcement could result in the products we developed or modified to comply with these standards becoming unnecessary or becoming necessary later than expected thereby, in some cases, negating our competitive advantage. This in turn can delay, diminish or eliminate the expected return on capital and research expenditures that we have invested in such products and may adversely affect our perceived competitive advantage in being an early, advanced developer of compliant engines.

We derive significant earnings from investees that we do not directly control, with more than 50 percent of these earnings from our China-based investees.

For 2017, we recognized $357 million of equity, royalty and interest income from investees, compared to $301 million in 2016.

More than half of our equity, royalty and interest income from investees is from

three of our 50 percent owned joint ventures in



China - Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd., Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. and Chongqing Cummins Engine Company, Ltd.

As a result, although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities, we do not unilaterally control their management or their operations, which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these entities. A significant reduction in the level of contribution by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.

The adoption of new tax legislation, changes in our provisional estimates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Legislation)

.

The estimated effects based upon current interpretation of the Tax Legislation have been incorporated into our financial results. As additional data is prepared and analyzed and as additional clarification and implementation guidance is issued on the new tax law, it may be necessary to adjust the provisional amounts. Any adjustments could have a material impact on provisional amounts. In addition, there is a risk that states or foreign jurisdictions may amend their tax laws in response to the Tax Legislation, which could have a material impact on our future results.

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. Our income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. The carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the U.S., is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision.

We are exposed to, and may be adversely affected by, potential security breaches or other disruptions to our information technology systems and data security.

We rely on the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology systems and data security infrastructure in connection with various aspects of our business activities. We also rely on our ability to expand and continually update these systems and related infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. As we implement new systems, they may not perform as expected. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades. In addition, some of these systems are managed by third party service providers and are not under our direct control. If we experience a problem with an important information technology system, including during system upgrades and/or new system implementations, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. As customers adopt and rely on the cloud-based digital technologies and services we offer, any disruption of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of those services could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.

The data handled by our information technology systems is vulnerable to security threats. Our operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, customers, dealers, suppliers, employees and other sensitive matters. Information technology security threats, such as security breaches, computer malware and other "cyber attacks," which are increasing in both frequency and sophistication, could result in unauthorized disclosures of information and create financial liability, subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions, or damage our reputation with customers, dealers, suppliers and other stakeholders. We continuously seek to maintain a robust program of information security and controls, but the impact of a material information technology event could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.

Financial distress or a change-in-control of one of our large truck OEM customers could materially adversely impact our results of operations.

We recognize significant sales of engines and components to a few large on-highway truck OEM customers in North America which have been an integral part of our positive business results for several years. If one of our large truck OEM customers experiences financial distress, bankruptcy or a change-in-control, such circumstance could likely lead to significant reductions in our revenues and earnings, commercial disputes, receivable collection issues, and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.



Our plan to reposition our portfolio of product offerings through exploring strategic acquisitions and divestitures may expose us to additional costs and risks.

Part of our strategic plan is to improve our gross margins and earnings by exploring the repositioning of our portfolio of product line offerings through the pursuit of potential strategic acquisitions and/or divestitures to provide future strategic, financial and operational benefits and improve shareholder value. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms. The successful identification and completion of any strategic transaction depends on a number of factors that are not entirely within our control, including the availability of suitable candidates and our ability to negotiate terms acceptable to all parties involved, conclude satisfactory agreements and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully negotiate and complete specific transactions. The exploration, negotiation and consummation of strategic transactions may involve significant expenditures by us, which may adversely affect our results of operations at the time such expenses are incurred, and may divert management’s attention from our existing business. Strategic transactions also may have adverse effects on our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers.

If required, the financing for strategic acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness, dilute the interests of our shareholders or both. Any acquisition may not be accretive to us for a significant period of time following the completion of such acquisition. Also, our ability to effectively integrate any potential acquisition into our existing business and culture may not be successful, which could jeopardize future financial and operational performance for the combined businesses. In addition, if an acquisition results in any additional goodwill or increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet and subsequently becomes impaired, we would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge, which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Similarly, any strategic divestiture of a product line or business may reduce our revenue and earnings, reduce the diversity of our business, result in substantial costs and expenses and cause disruption to our employees, customers, vendors and communities in which we operate.

We are vulnerable to supply shortages from single-sourced suppliers.

During 2017, we single sourced approximately 20 percent of the total types of parts in our product designs, compared to approximately 56 percent in 2016. Any delay in our suppliers' deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations, forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions. Delays may be caused by factors affecting our suppliers, including capacity constraints, labor disputes, economic downturns, availability of credit, the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, weather emergencies, natural disasters or acts of war or terrorism. Any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and our results of operations.

We face significant competition in the markets we serve.

The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. We primarily compete in the market with diesel engines and related diesel products; however, new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline, natural gas, electrification and other technologies and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies. Our products primarily compete on the basis of price, performance, fuel economy, speed of delivery, quality and customer support. We also face competitors in some emerging markets who have established local practices and long standing relationships with participants in these markets. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets.

Increasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers' growth.

As our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope, they are increasingly seeking to export their products to other countries. This has meant greater demand for our advanced engine technologies to help these customers meet the more stringent emissions requirements of developed markets, as well as greater demand for access to our distribution systems for purposes of equipment servicing. As these emerging market customers enter into, and begin to compete in more developed markets, they may increasingly begin to compete with our existing customers in these markets. Our further aid to emerging market customers could adversely affect our relationships with developed market customers. In addition, to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth in demand, we may see little or no benefit from this type of expansion by our emerging market customers.



Policy changes affecting international trade could adversely impact the demand for our products and our competitive position.

Changes in government policies on foreign trade and investment can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries. Our business benefits from free trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, and efforts to withdraw from, or substantially modify such agreements, in addition to the implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs, import or export licensing requirements, exchange controls or new barriers to entry, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Additionally, the results of the United Kingdom’s referendum on EU membership,

advising for the exit from the EU, has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global stock markets, currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty. Although it is unknown what the terms of the United Kingdom’s future relationship with the EU will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and EU and increased regulatory complexities. Any of these factors could adversely impact customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers and our results of operations.

We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate and other related risks.

We conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. Although the U.S. dollar weakened in 2017, the U.S. dollar strengthened in recent years through 2016 and resulted in material unfavorable impacts on our revenues in those years. If the U.S. dollar returns to strengthening against other currencies, we will experience additional volatility in our financial statements.

While we customarily enter into financial transactions that attempt to address these risks and many of our supply agreements with customers include foreign currency exchange rate adjustment provisions, there can be no assurance that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our future results of operations. In addition, while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

We also face risks arising from the imposition of foreign exchange controls and currency devaluations. Foreign exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation. See Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional information.

Our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs.

Our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames; however, the timing of material and commodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions. Additionally, higher material and commodity costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. While we customarily enter into financial transactions and contractual pricing adjustment provisions with our customers that attempt to address some of these risks (notably with respect to copper, platinum and palladium), there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, while the use of commodity price hedging instruments and contractual pricing adjustments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price. As a result, higher material and commodity costs, as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices, could result in declining margins.

We may fail to realize all of the expected enhanced revenue, earnings, and cash flow from our investment in the Eaton Cummins Automated Transmission Technologies joint venture.

Our ability to realize all of the expected enhanced revenue, earnings, and cash flow from our recent investment in the Eaton Cummins Automated Transmission Technologies joint venture will depend, in substantial part, on our ability to successfully launch the automated transmission products in North America and achieve our projected market penetration. While we believe



we will ultimately achieve these objectives, it is possible that we will be unable to achieve all of the goals within our anticipated time frame or in the anticipated amounts. If we are not able to successfully complete our automated transmission strategy, the anticipated enhanced revenue, earnings, and cash flows resulting from this joint venture may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected.

As part of the purchase accounting associated with the formation of the joint venture, significant goodwill and intangible asset balances were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. If cash flows from the joint venture fall short of our anticipated amounts, these assets could be subject to impairment charges, negatively impacting our earnings.

We are exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business.

Our business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries. These risks include:

•

the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;

•

trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;

•

the imposition of taxes on foreign income and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the U.S.;

•

the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions;

•

difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations;

•

required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; and

•

changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets.

As we continue to operate our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. There can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us.

Our global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk.

Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world. Recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anti-corruption, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws from other countries, as well as new regulatory requirements regarding data privacy, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. Our numerous foreign subsidiaries, affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws, rules and business practices that differ from those of the U.S. The activities of these entities may not comply with U.S. laws or business practices or our Code of Business Conduct. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.

We face the challenge of accurately aligning our capacity with our demand.

We can experience idle capacity as economies slow or demand for certain products decline. Accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity have been, and will continue to be, important factors in determining our results of operations. If we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity, we may have significantly underutilized assets and we may experience reduced margins. If we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our business is exposed to potential product liability claims.

We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products' failure to perform to specification results, or is alleged to result, in property damage, bodily injury and/or death. At any given time, we are subject to various and multiple product liability claims, any one of which, if decided adversely to us, may have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operation in the period in which our liability with respect to any such claim is recognized. While we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims. In addition, product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. Furthermore, even if we are successful in



defending against a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us.

Our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations.

Our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations governing air emission, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations, under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property. If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material.

Future bans or limitations on the use of diesel-powered vehicles, in an effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions, could materially adversely affect our business over the long term.

In an effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions, mayors of several large international cities announced that they plan to implement a ban on the use in their cities of diesel-powered vehicles by 2025. These cities include Athens, Madrid, Mexico City and Paris. Similarly, Germany adopted legislation to ban new internal combustion engine vehicles by 2030, and China is considering a ban on the production and sale of diesel-powered vehicles to be adopted in the near future. In addition, California government officials have called for the state to phase out sales of diesel-powered vehicles by 2040. To the extent that these types of bans are actually implemented in the future on a broad basis, or in one or more of our key markets, our business over the long-term could be materially adversely affected.

We are exposed to risks arising from the price and availability of energy.

The level of demand for our products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of energy. High energy costs generally drive greater demand for better fuel economy in almost all countries in which we operate. Some of our engine products have been developed with a primary purpose of offering fuel economy improvements, and if energy costs decrease or increase less than expected, demand for these products may likewise decrease. The relative unavailability of electricity in some emerging market countries also influences demand for our electricity generating products, such as our diesel generators. If these countries add energy capacity by expanding their power grids at a rate equal to or faster than the growth in demand for energy, the demand for our generating products could also decrease or increase less than would otherwise be the case.

Significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.

We sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans. Our pension cost and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value. We could experience increased pension cost due to a combination of factors, including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets, decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets.

Significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets, which could result in increased pension cost in future years and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Depending upon the severity of market declines and government regulatory changes, we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the U.S. and perhaps other countries and these contributions could be material.

We may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters.

At December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 58,600 persons worldwide. Approximately 20,830 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2018 and 2022.

While we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters, there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages, or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. Any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. In addition, many of our customers and suppliers have



unionized work forces. Work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by our customers or suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.

Our financial statements are subject to changes in accounting standards that could adversely impact our profitability or financial position.

Our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States of America, which are periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Recently, accounting standard setters issued new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to revenue recognition and lease accounting as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures. The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. An assessment of proposed standards is not provided, as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and, therefore, their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed. It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial position.

ITEM 3.    Legal Proceedings

We are subject to numerous lawsuits and claims arising out of the ordinary course of our business, including actions related to product liability; personal injury; the use and performance of our products; warranty matters; product recalls; patent, trademark or other intellectual property infringement; contractual liability; the conduct of our business; tax reporting in foreign jurisdictions; distributor termination; workplace safety; and environmental matters. We also have been identified as a potentially responsible party at multiple waste disposal sites under U.S. federal and related state environmental statutes and regulations and may have joint and several liability for any investigation and remediation costs incurred with respect to such sites. We have denied liability with respect to many of these lawsuits, claims and proceedings and are vigorously defending such lawsuits, claims and proceedings. We carry various forms of commercial, property and casualty, product liability and other forms of insurance; however, such insurance may not be applicable or adequate to cover the costs associated with a judgment against us with respect to these lawsuits, claims and proceedings. We do not believe that these lawsuits are material individually or in the aggregate. While we believe we have also established adequate accruals pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for our expected future liability with respect to pending lawsuits, claims and proceedings, where the nature and extent of any such liability can be reasonably estimated based upon then presently available information, there can be no assurance that the final resolution of any existing or future lawsuits, claims or proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

We are a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines and engine-related component products, including filtration, aftertreatment, turbochargers, fuel systems, controls systems, air handling systems, transmissions and electric power generation systems. We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and other customers worldwide.

We have long-standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve, including PACCAR Inc, Daimler Trucks North America, Navistar International Corporation and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.

We serve our customers through a network of approximately


wholly-owned and independent distributor locations and over

7,500

dealer locations in more than


countries and territories.

Our reportable operating segments consist of Engine, Distribution, Components and Power Systems. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves

. The Engine segment produces engines (15 liters and less in size) and associated parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various off-highway markets. Our engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well as in various industrial applications, including construction, agriculture, power generation systems and other off-highway applications. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMs throughout the world. The Components segment sells filtration products, aftertreatment systems, turbochargers, fuel systems and transmissions. The Power Systems segment is an integrated power provider, which designs, manufactures and sells engines (16 liters and larger) for industrial applications (including mining, oil and gas, marine and rail), standby and prime power generator sets, alternators and other power components.

Our financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve, particularly the on-highway, construction and general industrial markets. Demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions. Our sales may also be impacted by OEM inventory levels, production schedules and stoppages. Economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reduced sales of our products and can result in price reductions in certain products and/or markets. As a worldwide business, our operations are also affected by currency, political, economic and regulatory matters, including adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards, in the countries we serve. As part of our growth strategy, we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry high levels of these risks such as China, Brazil, India, Mexico, Russia and countries in the Middle East and Africa. At the same time, our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results.

Worldwide revenues

improved

17 percent

in


compared to


, with all operating segments reporting higher revenue. Revenue in the U.S. and Canada

improved

by 15 percent primarily due to increased demand in the North American on-highway markets, increased industrial demand (especially in oil and gas, construction and mining markets) and organic growth and higher sales related to the acquisition of a North American distributor in the fourth quarter of 2016. International demand growth (excludes the U.S. and Canada) in 2017

improved

revenues by 19 percent, with sales up in most of our markets,



especially in China, Russia, India and the U.K. The increase in international sales was primarily due to increased demand in the truck market in China, new emission regulations in India and increased demand in industrial markets (especially construction markets in China and mining markets in Europe).

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Legislation).  Among other things, the Tax Legislation changed the U.S. statutory rate to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018.  The impact of the Tax Legislation resulted in a net incremental charge to our

Consolidated Statements of Income

of

$777 million

.  The components of the 2017 charge were as follows:

Noncontrolling interest was reduced for withholding taxes on foreign earnings which reduced the income eliminated for non-

Cummins ownership interest attributable to Cummins India, Ltd.

The $781 million increase in tax expense is composed of three elements - the remeasurement of deferred taxes, a one-time transitional tax on unrepatriated earnings and withholding taxes on foreign earnings.

net income attributable to Cummins Inc. of

$1.4 billion

, or

$17.5 billion

. The decrease in net income attributable to Cummins Inc. and earnings per diluted share was driven by a

$777 million

reduction for tax adjustments related to the Tax Legislation

, increased selling, general and administrative expenses and higher research, development and engineering expenses, partially offset by higher net sales and gross margin, lower charges for a loss contingency and higher equity, royalty and interest income from investees.

The

increase

in gross margin was primarily due to

higher volumes, improved leverage and lower material costs, partially offset by higher warranty costs ($264 million primarily due to campaigns in the Engine, Components and Power Systems segments and changes in estimates in the Engine and Components segments) and increased variable compensation expense of $150 million.

Diluted earnings per share for 2017 was negatively impacted $4.65 per share due to the Tax Legislation, partially offset by a benefit of $0.04 per share from fewer weighted-average shares outstanding, primarily due to purchases under the stock repurchase program.

Economic conditions in Brazil may begin to improve, which could contribute to improved demand in our end-markets.

Challenges

•

Market demand in truck markets in China is expected to decline.

•

Marine markets are expected to remain weak.

In summary, we expect demand to improve or remain strong in many of our most important markets.

Income Tax Expense

Our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent U.S. statutory income tax rate, primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Legislation)

.

The Tax Legislation changed the U.S. statutory rate to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018.

Our effective tax rate for 2017 was

58.0 percent

compared to

24.6 percent

for


. The

impacts of the Tax Legislation resulted in additional income tax expense of

$781 million

to our tax provision (excluding the noncontrolling interest and equity investee adjustments). See Note

We expect our 2018 effective tax rate to be

2016 vs. 2015

Net Sales

Net sales decreased $1.6 billion versus 2015, primarily driven by the following:

•

Engine segment sales decreased 10 percent primarily due to lower demand in North American heavy-duty and medium-duty on-highway markets and lower demand in most North American off-highway markets, partially offset by increased sales in the light-duty automotive market.

•

Power Systems segment sales decreased 14 percent primarily due to lower demand in all product lines and decreased sales in most regions with the largest declines in North America, Asia, China, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa and Western Europe.



•

Components segment sales decreased 6 percent primarily due to lower demand in most lines of business, principally in North American on-highway markets, partially offset by higher demand in China.

•

Foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales by approximately 2 percent primarily in the British pound, Chinese renminbi, Indian rupee, Brazilian real, South African rand, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar.

Sales to international markets (excluding the U.S. and Canada), based on location of customers, were 42 percent of total net sales in 2016, compared with 39 percent of total net sales in 2015.

A more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the "Operating Segment Results" section.

Gross Margin

Gross margin decreased $495 million and 0.5 points as a percentage of sales, primarily due to lower volumes, unfavorable mix and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations (primarily in the Brazilian real, South African rand and Canadian dollar), partially offset by lower material and commodity costs, improved Distribution segment margins related to the acquisition of North American distributors since December 31, 2014 and lower warranty expense.

The provision for warranties issued, excluding campaigns, as a percentage of sales was 1.7 percent in 2016 and 1.8 percent in 2015. A more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the "Operating Segment Results" section.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $46 million, primarily due to lower compensation expenses of $56 million as a result of restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2015. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. Overall, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 11.7 percent in 2016 from 10.9 percent in 2015.

Research, Development and Engineering Expenses

Research, development and engineering expenses decreased $99 million, primarily due to reduced project spending in most of our segments, decreased compensation expenses as a result of restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2015, and lower consulting expenses. Overall, research, development and engineering expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 3.6 percent in 2016 from 3.8 percent in 2015. Research activities continue to focus on development of new products to meet future emission standards around the world and improvements in fuel economy performance.

Equity, Royalty and Interest Income From Investees

Equity, royalty and interest income from investees decreased $14 million, primarily due to the consolidation of partially-owned North American distributors of $12 million and lower earnings at Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd.

of

$10 million, partially offset by higher earnings at other joint ventures.

Loss Contingency Charges

In 2016, we recorded charges of $138 million in addition to the 2015 charge of $60 million for a loss contingency. See Note 12, "COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES," to the

Consolidated Financial Statements

for additional information.

Impairment of Light-duty Diesel Assets

In 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of $211 million on our light-duty diesel assets. See Note 19, "IMPAIRMENT OF LIGHT-DUTY DIESEL ASSETS," to the

Consolidated Financial Statements

for additional information.

Restructuring Actions and Other Charges

In 2015, we incurred a charge of $90 million, which included $86 million for the severance costs related to both voluntary and involuntary terminations and $4 million for asset impairments and other charges. See Note 20, "RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND OTHER CHARGES," to the

Consolidated Financial Statements

for additional information.



Other Operating Income (Expense), Net

Other operating income (expense), net was as follows:

Interest Income

Interest income was relatively flat compared to 2015.

Interest Expense

Interest expense increased $4 million versus the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to an increase in total weighted-average debt outstanding.

Income Tax Expense

Our effective tax rate for 2016 was 24.6 percent compared to 27.4 percent for 2015. The 2.8 percent decrease in our effective tax rate from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to favorable changes in the jurisdictional mix of pre-tax income.

Noncontrolling Interests

Noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries decreased $9 million primarily due to lower earnings as a result of the consolidation of North American distributors since December 31, 2014 and lower earnings at Cummins India Ltd.

Net Income Attributable to Cummins Inc. and Diluted Earnings Per Common Share Attributable to Cummins Inc.

Net income was relatively flat as significantly lower gross margin and higher loss contingency charges were mostly offset by the absence of 2015 impairment and restructuring charges, in addition to lower research, development and engineering expenses, a lower effective tax rate, lower selling, general and administrative expenses and favorable changes to corporate owned life insurance. Diluted earnings per share for 2017 benefited $0.26 per share from lower shares outstanding, primarily due to purchases under the stock repurchase program.

$1.75 billion

available capacity under our five-year revolving credit facility to

$1.45 billion

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

A significant portion of our cash flows is generated outside the U.S.

We manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. As a result, we do not anticipate any local liquidity restrictions to preclude us from funding our operating needs with local resources.

The Tax Legislation made significant changes to U.S. tax law, including a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings of

$298 million

with a cash impact of

$338 million

. The payments associated with this deemed repatriation will be paid over eight years. The unrepatriated foreign earnings at December 31, 2017, will be repatriated as needed to fund cash needs. The estimated accrued withholding taxes of

$331 million

on foreign earnings that we plan to repatriate in the foreseeable future will be paid as cash is repatriated

Debt Facilities and Other Sources of Liquidity

On November 13, 2015, we entered into an amended and restated five-year revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders, which provides us with a

$1.75 billion

senior unsecured revolving credit facility and expires on November 13, 2020

.

On September 5, 2017, we entered into a 364-day credit facility that allows us to borrow up to

$1 billion

of additional unsecured funds at any time through September 2018.

We have access to both credit facilities which total

$2.75 billion

of borrowing capacity.

We intend to maintain credit facilities of a similar aggregate amount by renewing or replacing these facilities before expiration.

Revolving credit facilities are maintained primarily to provide backup liquidity for our commercial paper borrowings, letters of credit and general corporate purposes.



We can issue up to $1.75 billion of unsecured short-term promissory notes ("commercial paper") pursuant to our board authorized commercial paper programs. The programs facilitate the private placement of unsecured short-term debt through third party brokers. We intend to use the net proceeds from the commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes.

The total combined borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility and commercial paper program should not exceed $2.75 billion. See Note

Management's Assessment of Liquidity

Our financial condition and liquidity remain strong. Our solid balance sheet and credit ratings enable us to have ready access to credit and the capital markets. We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. We believe our operating cash flow and liquidity provides us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividend payments, projected pension obligations and debt service obligations. While we expect more efficient access to overseas earnings as a result of Tax Legislation, we continue to generate cash from operations in the U.S. and maintain access to our revolving credit facility as noted above.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note


, "

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

," of our

Consolidated Financial Statements

which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives.

Our

Consolidated Financial Statements

are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP) which often requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements. Management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In any given reporting period, our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our

Consolidated Financial Statements.

Critical accounting estimates are defined as follows: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies, related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs, accounting for income taxes and pension benefits.



Warranty Programs

We estimate and record a liability for base warranty programs at the time our products are sold. Our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management's best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs, the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action or when a recall becomes probable and estimable, which generally occurs when it is announced. Our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates, repair costs and the point of failure within the product life cycle. Future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability. New product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. Product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch, with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch. We generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a preceding product's warranty history and a multiplicative factor based upon preceding similar product experience and new product assessment until sufficient new product data is available for warranty estimation. We then use a blend of actual new product experience and preceding product historical experience for several subsequent quarters, and new product specific experience thereafter. Note

PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY

Consolidated Financial Statements

contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for


,


and


including adjustments to pre-existing warranties.

Accounting for Income Taxes

We determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future tax benefits of net operating loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets.

At

December 31, 2017

, we recorded net deferred tax liabilities of

$85 million

. The assets included

$359 million

for the value of net operating loss and credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance of

$347 million

was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized.

In the event our operating performance deteriorates, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Legislation)

. We have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Tax Legislation. We made provisional estimates of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances, the one-time transition tax, and the withholding tax accrued on those earnings not permanently reinvested at December 31, 2017. The final transition impacts of the Tax Legislation may differ from our estimates, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations for the Tax Legislation, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the Tax Legislation, any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the Tax Legislation, or any updates or changes to estimates the company has utilized to calculate the transition impacts. Final calculations will be completed within the one year measurement period ending December 22, 2018, as required under the rules issued by the SEC. Any change of provisional amounts will be reported in income from continuing operations in the period in which the initial estimates are revised.

In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We accrue for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions. We have taken and we believe we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available. A more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in

Pension Benefits

We sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the U.S. and the U.K. and to a lesser degree in various other countries. In the U.S. and the U.K., we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded. We account for our pension programs in accordance with employers' accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans under GAAP. GAAP requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis. As a result, our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at December 31. These assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities, assumed rates of return on plan assets, future compensation increases, employee turnover rates, actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age, mortality rates and participant withdrawals. The actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions, participant life span and withdrawal rates. These differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension cost to be recorded in our

Consolidated Financial Statements

in the future.



The expected long-term return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension cost. We considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets. The long-term rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations. Projected returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded passive fixed income and equity indices and forward-looking estimates of the value added by active investment management.

At December 31, 2017, based upon our target asset allocations, it is anticipated that our U.S. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 10-year projection period equal to or in excess of 6.5 percent approximately 32 percent of the time

while returns of 7.0 percent or greater are anticipated 21 percent of the time,

including the additional positive returns expected from active investment management.

Our plan assets have averaged annualized returns of

10.5 percent

over the prior eight years, and resulted in approximately

$418 million

of actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensive income in the same period. Based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations, we believe an investment return assumption of

6.5 percent

per year in


for U.S. pension assets is reasonable.

The methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the U.K. was based on establishing an equity-risk premium over current long-term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations.

At December 31, 2017, based upon our target asset allocations, it is anticipated that our U.K. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20-year projection period equal to or in excess of 4.1 percent approximately 50 percent of the time while returns of 4.8 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time.

We expect modest additional positive returns from active investment management. The one-year return for our U.K. plans was

4.4 percent

for


, and similar to our U.S. plans, the strong returns since 2010 have resulted in approximately

$383 million

of actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensive income. Our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a long-term outlook. Therefore, the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a long-term horizon. Based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations as the plan assets continue to be de-risked, we believe an investment return assumption of

4.0 percent

in


for U.K. pension assets is reasonable. Our pension plan asset allocations at December 31,


and


and target allocation for


are as follows:

The differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected long-term return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic cost over five years. The table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension cost for the period


-


and our expected rate of return for


.

A lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension cost and reduce profitability.

GAAP for pensions offers various acceptable alternatives to account for the differences that eventually arise between the estimates used in the actuarial valuations and the actual results. It is acceptable to delay or immediately recognize these differences. Under the delayed recognition alternative, changes in pension obligations (including those resulting from plan amendments) and changes in the value of assets set aside to meet those obligations are not recognized in net periodic pension cost as they occur but are recognized initially in accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently amortized as components of net periodic pension cost systematically and gradually over future periods. In addition to this approach, GAAP also allows immediate recognition of actuarial gains or losses. Immediate recognition introduces volatility in financial results. We have chosen to delay recognition and amortize actuarial differences over future periods. If we adopted the immediate recognition approach, we would record a loss of

$864 million

(

$680 million

after-tax) from cumulative actuarial net losses for our U.S. and U.K. pension plans.



The difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds

10 percent

of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation, amortized over future years of service. This is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions. Under GAAP, the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. At December 31,


, we had net pension actuarial losses of

$649 million

and

$207 million

for the U.S. and U.K. pension plans, respectively. As these amounts exceed

10 percent

of their respective plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees. Net actuarial losses decreased our shareholders' equity by

$28 million

after-tax in


. The loss is due to lower discount rates in the U.S. and U.K. and unfavorable foreign currency, partially offset by strong asset performance in the U.S. and the U.K.

The table below sets forth the net periodic pension cost for the years ended December 31 and our expected cost for


.

We expect


net periodic pension cost to

decrease

compared to


, primarily due to reduced loss amortization in the U.S. and U.K., which resulted from strong asset performance, partially offset by lower expected asset returns in the U.S. and U.K. as we de-risk plan trust assets. The increase in net periodic pension cost in


compared to


was primarily due to onboarding North American distributors to Cummins pension benefits, a lower expected rate of return in the U.S. and U.K. and lower discount rates in the U.S. and U.K. The

decrease

in net periodic pension cost in


compared to


was due to reduced loss amortizations in the U.S. and U.K. and higher discount rates in the U.S. and U.K., partially offset by lower expected asset returns in the U.K. as we de-risked plan trust assets. Another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension cost is the discount rate. The weighted-average discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension cost are set forth in the table below.

Changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension cost calculation.

The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. The guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in GAAP which suggests the use of a high-quality corporate bond rate. We used bond information provided by Moody's Investor Services, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Rating Services. All bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the U.S. and U.K. were deemed high-quality, non-callable bonds (Aa or better) at December 31,


, by at least one of the bond rating agencies.

Our model called for projected payments until near extinction for the U.S. and the U.K. For both countries, our model matches the present value of the plan's projected benefit payments to the market value of the theoretical settlement bond portfolio. A single equivalent discount rate is determined to align the present value of the required cash flow with the value of the bond portfolio. The resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plan's distinct liability characteristics.

The table below sets forth the estimated impact on our


net periodic pension cost relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets.



The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. A higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension cost. A lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension cost. It should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. Note

ITEM 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. This risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps, commodity zero-cost collars and physical forward contracts. These instruments, as further described below, are accounted for as cash flow or fair value hedges or as economic hedges not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes. When material, we adjust the estimated fair value of our derivative contracts for counterparty or our credit risk. None of our derivative instruments are subject to collateral requirements. Substantially all of our derivative contracts are subject to master netting arrangements which provide us with the option to settle certain contracts on a net basis when they settle on the same day with the same currency. In addition, these arrangements provide for a net settlement of all contracts with a given counterparty in the event that the arrangement is terminated due to the occurrence of default or a termination event.

We also enter into physical forward contracts with certain suppliers to purchase minimum volumes of commodities at contractually stated prices for various periods. These arrangements, as further described below, enable us to fix the prices of portions of our normal purchases of these commodities, which otherwise are subject to market volatility.

The following describes our risk exposures and provides the results of a sensitivity analysis performed at December 31,


. The sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous, parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.

Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

As a result of our international business presence, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks. We transact business in foreign currencies and, as a result, our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. To help manage our exposure to exchange rate volatility, we use foreign currency forward contracts on a regular basis to hedge forecasted intercompany and third-party sales and purchases denominated in non-functional currencies. Our internal policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flows for up to

18 months

.

These foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges under GAAP.

For the years ended December 31,


and


,

there were no circumstances that would have resulted in the discontinuance of a foreign currency cash flow hedge.

To minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts, which are considered economic hedges. The objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward contract. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under GAAP.

At December 31, 2017, the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts, assuming a hypothetical


percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts, would be approximately

$101 million

. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months. The analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels. Any change in the value of the contracts, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items

.



Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. We manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of interest rate swaps. The objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk.

We have a series of interest rate swaps to effectively convert our September 2013,

$500 million

debt issue, due in 2023, from a fixed rate of

3.65 percent

to a floating rate equal to the

one-month LIBOR

plus a spread.

The terms of the swaps mirror those of the debt, with interest paid semi-annually. The swaps were designated, and will be accounted for, as fair value hedges under GAAP. The gain or loss on these derivative instruments, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in current income as “Interest expense.” The net swap settlements that accrue each period are also reported in interest expense.

The following table summarizes these gains and losses for the years presented below:

___________________________________________________________

(1)

The difference between the gain/(loss) on swaps and borrowings represents hedge ineffectiveness.

Commodity Price Risk

We are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers. In order to protect ourselves against future price volatility and, consequently, fluctuations in gross margins, we periodically enter into commodity zero-cost collar contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations. These commodity zero-cost collar contracts that represent an economic hedge, but are not designated for hedge accounting and are marked to market through earnings. Our internal policy allows for managing our cash flow hedges for up to three years.

At December 31, 2017, the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity zero-cost collar contracts, assuming a hypothetical


percent fluctuation in the price of such commodities, would be approximately

$3 million

. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months. The analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels. Any change in the value of the zero-cost collar contracts, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items.

We also limit our exposure to commodity price risk by entering into purchasing arrangements to fix the price of certain volumes of platinum and palladium expected to be used in our products. We enter into physical forward contracts with suppliers of platinum and palladium to purchase some volumes of the commodities at contractually stated prices for various periods, generally not exceeding one year. These arrangements enable us to fix the prices of a portion of our purchases of these commodities, which otherwise are subject to market volatility.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS

Management's Report on Financial Statements and Practices

The accompanying

Consolidated Financial Statements

of Cummins Inc. were prepared by management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts that are based on management's best judgments and estimates. The other financial information included in the annual report is consistent with that in the financial statements.

Management also recognizes its responsibility for conducting our affairs according to the highest standards of personal and corporate conduct. This responsibility is characterized and reflected in key policy statements issued from time to time regarding, among other things, conduct of its business activities within the laws of the host countries in which we operate, within The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and potentially conflicting interests of its employees. We maintain a systematic program to assess compliance with these policies.

To comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we designed and implemented a structured and comprehensive compliance process to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting across the enterprise.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Cummins Inc.:

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cummins Inc. and its subsidiaries as of

December 31, 2017

and


, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2017

, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2017

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of

December 31, 2017

and


, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2017

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2017

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations

We were founded in 1919 as Cummins Engine Company, a corporation in Columbus, Indiana and one of the first diesel engine manufacturers. In 2001, we changed our name to Cummins Inc.

We are a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines and engine-related component products, including filtration, aftertreatment, turbochargers, fuel systems, controls systems, air handling systems, transmissions and electric power generation systems. We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and other customers worldwide.

We serve our customers through a network of approximately


wholly-owned and independent distributor locations and over

7,500

dealer locations in more than


countries and territories.

Principles of Consolidation

Our

Consolidated Financial Statements

include the accounts of all wholly-owned and majority-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries where our ownership is more than 50 percent of outstanding equity interests except for majority-owned subsidiaries that are considered variable interest entities (VIEs) where we are not deemed to have a controlling financial interest. In addition, we also consolidate, regardless of our ownership percentage, VIEs for which we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Where our ownership interest is less than 100 percent, the noncontrolling ownership interests are reported in our

Consolidated Balance Sheets

. The noncontrolling ownership interest in our income, net of tax, is classified as "Net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests" in our

Consolidated Statements of Income

.

We have variable interests in several businesses accounted for under the equity method of accounting that are deemed to be VIEs and are subject to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) for variable interest entities. Most of these VIEs are unconsolidated.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts for


and


have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Investments in Equity Investees

We use the equity method to account for our investments in joint ventures, affiliated companies and alliances in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, generally represented by equity ownership or partnership equity of at least


percent

but not more than


percent

. Generally, under the equity method, original investments in these entities are recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted by our share of equity in income or losses after the date of acquisition. Investment amounts in excess of our share of an investee's net assets are amortized over the life of the related asset creating the excess. If the excess is goodwill, then it is not amortized. Equity in income or losses of each investee is recorded according to our level of ownership; if losses accumulate, we record our share of losses until our investment has been fully depleted. If our investment has been fully depleted, we recognize additional losses only when we are the primary funding source. We eliminate (to the extent of our ownership percentage) in our

Consolidated Financial Statements

the profit in inventory held by our equity method investees that has not yet been sold to a third-party. Our investments are classified as "Investments and advances related to equity method investees" in our

Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Our share of the results from joint ventures, affiliated companies and alliances is reported in our

Consolidated Statements of Income

as "Equity, royalty and interest income from investees," and is reported net of all applicable income taxes.

Our foreign equity investees are presented net of applicable foreign income taxes in our

Consolidated Statements of Income

. Our remaining United States (U.S.) equity investees are partnerships (non-taxable), thus there is no difference between gross or net of tax presentation as the investees are not taxed. See

NOTE 3

, "

INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INVESTEES

," for additional information.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of the Financial Statements

Preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts presented and disclosed in our

Consolidated Financial Statements

. Significant estimates and assumptions in these

Consolidated Financial Statements

require the exercise of judgment and are used for, but not limited to, allowance for doubtful accounts, estimates of future cash flows and other assumptions associated with goodwill and long-lived asset impairment tests, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, warranty programs, determination of discount rate and



other assumptions for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, income taxes and deferred tax valuation allowances, lease classification and contingencies. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be different from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue, net of estimated costs of returns, allowances and sales incentives, when it is realized or realizable, which generally occurs when:

•

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;

•

The product has been shipped and legal title and all risks of ownership have been transferred;

•

The sales price is fixed or determinable; and

•

Payment is reasonably assured.

Products are generally sold on open account under credit terms customary to the geographic region of distribution. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral to secure our accounts receivable. For engines, service parts, service tools and other items sold to independent distributors and to partially-owned distributors accounted for under the equity method, revenues are recorded when title and risk of ownership transfers. This transfer is based on the agreement in effect with the respective distributor, which generally occurs when the products are shipped. To the extent of our ownership percentage, margins on sales to distributors accounted for under the equity method are deferred until the distributor sells the product to unrelated parties.

We provide various sales incentives to both our distribution network and our OEM customers. These programs are designed to promote the sale of our product in the channel or encourage the usage of our products by OEM customers. Sales incentives primarily fall into three categories:

•

Volume rebates;

•

Market share rebates; and

•

Aftermarket rebates.

For volume rebates, we provide certain customers with rebate opportunities for attaining specified volumes during a particular quarter or year. We accrue for the expected amount of these rebates at the time of the original sale and update our accruals quarterly based on our best estimate of the volume levels the customer will reach during the measurement period. For market share rebates, we provide certain customers with rebate opportunities based on the percentage of their production that utilizes our product. These rebates are typically measured either quarterly or annually and are accrued at the time of the original sale based on the current market shares, with adjustments made as the level changes. For aftermarket rebates, we provide incentives to promote sales to certain dealers and end-markets. These rebates are typically paid on a quarterly, or more frequent, basis and estimates are made at the end of each quarter as to the amount yet to be paid. These estimates are based on historical experience with the particular program. The incentives are classified as a reduction in sales in our

Consolidated Statements of Income

.

We classify shipping and handling billed to customers as sales in our

Consolidated Statements of Income

. Substantially all shipping and handling costs are included in "Cost of sales."

Rights of return do not exist for the majority of our sales, other than for quality issues. We do offer certain return rights in our aftermarket business, where some aftermarket customers are permitted to return small amounts of parts and filters each year and in our power systems business, which sells portable generators to retail customers. An estimate of future returns is accrued at the time of sale based on historical return rates.

Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation

We translate assets and liabilities of foreign entities to U.S. dollars, where the local currency is the functional currency, at year-end exchange rates. We translate income and expenses to U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates for the year. We record adjustments resulting from translation in a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) and include the adjustments in net income only upon sale, loss of controlling financial interest or liquidation of the underlying foreign investment.



Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in current net income. For foreign entities where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, including those operating in highly inflationary economies when applicable, we remeasure non-monetary balances and the related income statement using historical exchange rates. We include in income the resulting gains and losses, including the effect of derivatives in our

Consolidated Statements of Income

, which combined with transaction gains and losses amounted to a net

loss

of

$


million

,

$


million

and

$


million

for the years ended December 31,


,


and


, respectively.

Fair Value Measurements

A three-level valuation hierarchy, based upon the observable and unobservable inputs, is used for fair value measurements. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions based on the best evidence available. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:

•

Level 1 - Quoted prices for

identical

instruments in active markets;

•

Level 2 - Quoted prices for

similar

instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose significant inputs are observable; and

•

Level 3 - Instruments whose significant inputs are

unobservable

.

Derivative Instruments

We make use of derivative instruments in foreign exchange, commodity price and interest rate hedging programs. Derivatives currently in use are foreign currency forward contracts, commodity physical forward contracts, options and interest rate swaps. These contracts are used strictly for hedging and not for speculative purposes.

We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. We manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of interest rate swaps. The objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk. The gain or loss on these derivative instruments as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item are recognized in current income as "Interest expense." For more detail on our interest rate swaps, see

NOTE 9

, "

DEBT

."

Due to our international business presence, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. We transact in foreign currencies and have assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Consequently, our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to benefit from global diversification and after considering naturally offsetting currency positions, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize our existing exposures (recognized assets and liabilities) and hedge forecasted transactions. Foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges under GAAP. The effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss on the forward contract is deferred and reported as a component of AOCL. When the hedged forecasted transaction (sale or purchase) occurs, the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income.

To minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts, which are considered economic hedges. The objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward contract. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under GAAP.

We are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers. In order to protect ourselves against future price volatility and, consequently, fluctuations in gross margins, we periodically enter into commodity physical forward contracts and zero-cost collar contracts with designated banks and other counterparties to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations. The physical forward contracts qualify for the normal purchases scope exceptions and are treated as purchase commitments. The commodity zero-cost collar contracts that represent an economic hedge, but are not designated for hedge accounting, are marked to market through earnings.

Income Tax Accounting

We determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future tax benefits of net operating loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets.

A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believes is more likely than not to be realized.

In the event our operating performance deteriorates, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation



allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets.

In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We accrue for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions. We have taken and we believe we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available. A more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in

NOTE 2

, "

INCOME TAXES

."

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents are defined as short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. The carrying amounts reflected in our

Consolidated Balance Sheets

for cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these investments.

Marketable Securities

We account for marketable securities in accordance with GAAP for investments in debt and equity securities. We determine the appropriate classification of all marketable securities as "held-to-maturity," "available-for-sale" or "trading" at the time of purchase, and re-evaluate such classifications at each balance sheet date. At December 31,


and


, all of our investments were classified as available-for-sale.

Available-for-sale (AFS) securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gain or loss, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income. Unrealized losses considered to be "other-than-temporary" are recognized currently in income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. The fair value of most investment securities is determined by currently available market prices. Where quoted market prices are not available, we use the market price of similar types of securities that are traded in the market to estimate fair value. See

NOTE 4

, "

MARKETABLE SECURITIES

," for a detailed description of our investments in marketable securities.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, which approximates net realizable value, and generally do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on our historical collection experience and by performing an analysis of our accounts receivable in light of the current economic environment. We review our allowance for doubtful accounts on a regular basis. In addition, when necessary, we provide an allowance for the full amount of specific accounts deemed to be uncollectible. Account balances are charged off against the allowance in the period in which we determine that it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. The allowance for doubtful accounts balances for the years ended December 31,


and


were

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively.

Inventories

Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. For the years ended December 31,


and


, approximately


percent

and


percent

, respectively,

of our consolidated inventories (primarily heavy-duty and high-horsepower engines and parts) were valued using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost method. The cost of other inventories is generally valued using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method. Our inventories at interim and year-end reporting dates include estimates for adjustments related to annual physical inventory results and for inventory cost changes under the LIFO cost method. Due to significant movements of partially-manufactured components and parts between manufacturing plants, we do not internally measure, nor do our accounting systems provide, a meaningful segregation between raw materials and work-in-process.

See

NOTE 5

, "

INVENTORIES

," for additional information.

Property, Plant and Equipment

We record property, plant and equipment, inclusive of assets under capital leases, at cost. We depreciate the cost of the majority of our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method with depreciable lives ranging from


to


years

for buildings and


to


years

for machinery, equipment and fixtures.

Capital lease amortization is recorded in depreciation expense. We expense normal maintenance and repair costs as incurred. Depreciation expense totaled

$


million

for the years ended December 31,


,


and

NOTE 6

, "

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

," for additional information.



Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We review our long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of the long-lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. An impairment of a long-lived asset or asset group exists when the expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) estimated to be generated by the asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset or asset group, an impairment loss is measured based on the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the asset or asset group. Assumptions and estimates used to estimate cash flows in the evaluation of impairment and the fair values used to determine the impairment are subject to a degree of judgment and complexity. Any changes to the assumptions and estimates resulting from changes in actual results or market conditions from those anticipated may affect the carrying value of long-lived assets and could result in a future impairment charge. See

NOTE 19

, "

IMPAIRMENT OF LIGHT-DUTY DIESEL ASSETS

," for additional information.

Goodwill

Under GAAP for goodwill, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform an annual two-step goodwill impairment test. We have elected this option on certain reporting units. The two-step impairment test is now only required if an entity determines through this qualitative analysis that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. In addition, the carrying value of goodwill must be tested for impairment on an interim basis in certain circumstances where impairment may be indicated. When we are required or opt to perform the two-step impairment test, the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated by discounting the after tax future cash flows less requirements for working capital and fixed asset additions. Our reporting units are generally defined as one level below an operating segment. However, there are two situations where we have aggregated two or more reporting units which share similar economic characteristics and thus are aggregated into a single reporting unit for testing purposes. These two situations are described further below:

•

Within our Components segment, our emission solutions and filtration businesses have been aggregated into a single reporting unit.

•

Our Distribution segment is considered a single reporting unit as it is managed geographically and all regions share similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services.

Our valuation method requires us to make projections of revenue, operating expenses, working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the reporting units over a multi-year period. Additionally, management must estimate a weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects a market rate, for each reporting unit for use as a discount rate. The discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and, if less than the carrying value, a separate valuation of the goodwill is required to determine if an impairment loss has occurred. In addition, we also perform a sensitivity analysis to determine how much our forecasts can fluctuate before the fair value of a reporting unit would be lower than its carrying amount. We performed the required procedures as of the end of our fiscal third quarter and determined that our goodwill was not impaired.

At December 31,


, our recorded goodwill was

$

1,082

million

, approximately


percent

of which resided in the aggregated emission solutions and filtration reporting unit. For this reporting unit, the fair value exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin. Approximately


percent

and


percent

of goodwill resides in our new automated transmissions reporting unit and our Brammo Inc. acquisition (not yet allocated to a segment), respectively. Since these businesses were just acquired in the second half of 2017, we did not perform an additional quantitative test as of the end of our third fiscal quarter.

See

NOTE 18

, "

ACQUISITIONS

," for additional information on the acquisition related goodwill recorded at the respective acquisition dates.

Changes in our projections or estimates, a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect or a significant increase in the discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units and result in a future impairment of goodwill.

See

NOTE 7

, "

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

," for additional information.

Other Intangible Assets

We capitalize other intangible assets, such as trademarks, patents, and customer relationships, that have been acquired either individually or with a group of other assets.  These intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives generally ranging from


to


years. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable over the remaining lives of the assets. See

Software

We capitalize software that is developed or obtained for internal use. Software costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives generally ranging from


to


years. Software assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable over the remaining lives of the assets. Upgrades and enhancements are capitalized if they result in significant modifications that enable the software to perform tasks it was previously incapable of performing. Software maintenance, training, data conversion and business process reengineering costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. See

NOTE 7

, "

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

," for additional information.

Warranty

We charge the estimated costs of warranty programs, other than product recalls, to cost of sales at the time products are sold and revenue is recognized. We use historical experience to develop the estimated liability for our various warranty programs. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs, the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action or when a recall becomes probable and estimable, which generally occurs when it is announced. The liability for these programs is reflected in the provision for warranties issued. We review and assess the liability for these programs on a quarterly basis. We also assess our ability to recover certain costs from our suppliers and record a receivable when we believe a recovery is probable. In addition to costs incurred on warranty and recall programs, from time to time we also incur costs related to customer satisfaction programs for items not covered by warranty. We accrue for these costs when agreement is reached with a specific customer. These costs are not included in the provision for warranties, but are included in cost of sales.

In addition, we sell extended warranty coverage on most of our engines. The revenue collected is initially deferred and is recognized as revenue in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing services over the contract period. We compare the remaining deferred revenue balance quarterly to the estimated amount of future claims under extended warranty programs and provide an additional accrual when the deferred revenue balance is less than expected future costs.

Research and Development

Our research and development program is focused on product improvements, product extensions, innovations and cost reductions for our customers. Research and development expenditures include salaries, contractor fees, building costs, utilities, testing, technical IT, administrative expenses and allocation of corporate costs and are expensed, net of contract reimbursements, when incurred. From time to time, we enter into agreements with customers and government agencies to fund a portion of the research and development costs of a particular project. We generally account for these reimbursements as an offset to the related research and development expenditure. Research and development expenses, net of contract reimbursements, were

RECENTLY ADOPTED AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted

In February 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended its standard on comprehensive income to provide an option for an entity to reclassify the stranded tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Legislation) that was passed in December of 2017 from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) directly to retained earnings.  The stranded tax effects result from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities which were originally recorded in comprehensive income but whose remeasurement is reflected in the income statement.  This is a one-time amendment applicable only to the changes resulting from the Tax Legislation.  The standard is effective for us on January 1, 2019, and may be reflected retroactively to any period in which the impacts of the Tax Legislation are recognized.  The standard permits early adoption for any financial statements that have not been released as of the date of the revised standard. We elected to early adopt this standard in our 2017 financial statements using specific identification and as a result reclassified

$


million

from



AOCI to retained earnings which is reflected in the rollforward of AOCI.

This reclassification relates only to the change in the statutory tax rate. See

NOTE 14

, "

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS

," for additional information.

In March 2016, the FASB amended its standards related to accounting for stock compensation, which became effective for us beginning January 1, 2017. The amendment replaced the requirement to record excess tax benefits and certain tax deficiencies in additional paid-in capital by recording all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense / benefit in the

Consolidated Statements of Income

and was adopted prospectively. In addition, the standard impacted our

Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow

retrospectively, as excess tax benefits are now required to be presented as an operating activity and the cash paid to tax authorities is required to be presented as a financing activity. This resulted in a net reclassification of

$


million

and

$


million

from operating to financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Finally, in accordance with the standard, we elected to continue our historical approach of estimating forfeitures during the award's vesting period and adjusting our estimate when it is no longer probable that the employee will fulfill the service condition. The adoption of the standard was not material to our

Consolidated Financial Statements

.

Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Effective

In August 2017, the FASB amended its standards related to accounting for derivatives and hedging. These amendments allow the initial hedge effectiveness assessment to be performed by the end of the first quarter in which the hedge is designated rather than concurrently with entering into the hedge transaction. The changes also expand the use of a periodic qualitative hedge effectiveness assessment in lieu of an ongoing quantitative assessment performed throughout the life of the hedge. The revision removes the requirement to record ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges through the income statement when a hedge is considered highly effective, instead deferring all related hedge gains and losses in "Other comprehensive income" until the hedged item impacts earnings. The modifications permit hedging the contractually-specified price of a component of a commodity purchase and revises certain disclosure requirements. The amendments are effective January 1, 2019 and early adoption is permitted in any interim period or fiscal year prior to the effective date. The revised standard is required to be adopted on a modified retrospective basis for any cash flow or net investment hedge relationships that exist on the date of adoption and prospectively for disclosures. We do not expect the amendments to have a material effect on our

Consolidated Financial Statements

and are still evaluating early adoption.

In March 2017, the FASB amended its standards related to the presentation of pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the financial statements beginning January 1, 2018. Under the new standard, we will be required to separate service costs from all other elements of pension costs and reflect the other elements of pension costs outside of operating income in our

Consolidated Statements of Income

. In addition, the standard will limit the amount eligible for capitalization (into inventory or self-constructed assets) to the amount of service cost. This portion of the standard will be applied on a prospective basis. The remainder of the new standard is effective for us on a retrospective basis. The retroactive adoption of this standard will result in a reduction in operating income and a corresponding increase in other income (primarily related to the return on pension assets) of

$


million

and

$


million

for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

In August 2016, the FASB amended its standards related to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments. The new standard will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The new standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. We do not expect adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our

Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

In June 2016, the FASB amended its standards related to accounting for credit losses on financial instruments. This amendment introduces new guidance for accounting for credit losses on instruments including trade receivables and held-to-maturity debt securities. The new rules are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our

Consolidated Financial Statements.

In February 2016, the FASB amended its standards related to the accounting for leases. Under the new standard, lessees will now be required to recognize substantially all leases on the balance sheet as both a right-of-use-asset and a liability. The standard will continue to have two types of leases for income statement recognition purposes: operating leases and finance leases. Operating leases will result in the recognition of a single lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term similar to the treatment for operating leases under today's standards. Finance leases will result in an accelerated expense similar to the accounting for capital leases under today's standards. The determination of a lease classification as operating or finance will occur in a manner similar to today's standard. The new standard also contains amended guidance regarding the identification of embedded leases in service contracts and the identification of lease and non-lease components of an arrangement. The new standard is effective on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are still evaluating the impact the standard could have on our

Consolidated Financial Statements

, including our internal controls over financial



reporting. While we have not yet quantified the amount, we do expect the standard will have a material impact on our

Consolidated Balance Sheets

due to the recognition of additional assets and liabilities for operating leases.

In January 2016, the FASB amended its standards related to the accounting for certain financial instruments. This amendment addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. The new rules will become effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. We do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our

Consolidated Financial Statements

.

In May 2014, the FASB amended its standards related to revenue recognition which replaces all existing revenue recognition guidance and provides a single, comprehensive model for all contracts with customers. The revised standard contains principles to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. The underlying principle is that we will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. Other major provisions include capitalization of certain contract costs, consideration of the time value of money in the transaction price and allowing estimation of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. The amendment also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in those judgments as well as assets recognized from costs incurred to fulfill these contracts.

The standard allows either full or modified retrospective adoption effective for annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2018.

We will adopt the standard using the modified retrospective approach.

We identified a change in the manner in which we will account for certain license income. We license certain technology to our unconsolidated joint ventures that meet the definition of functional under the standard, which requires that revenue be recognized at a point in time rather than the current requirement of recognizing it over the license term. Using the modified retrospective adoption method, we will record an adjustment to our opening equity balance at January 1, 2018, to account for the differences between existing revenue recorded and what would have been recorded under the new standard for contracts for which we started recognizing revenue prior to the adoption date. We expect to record a credit to equity of approximately

$


million

before taxes. We do not expect a material impact on any individual year from this change.

We also identified transactions where revenue recognition is currently limited to the amount of billings not contingent on our future performance. With the allocation provisions of the new model, we expect to accelerate the timing of revenue recognition for amounts related to satisfied performance obligations that would be delayed under the current guidance. We do not expect the impact of this change to be material.

On an ongoing basis, we do not expect this amendment to have a material impact on our

Consolidated Financial Statements,

including our internal controls over financial reporting. The revenue recognition disclosures will significantly expand under the new standard, specifically around the quantitative and qualitative information about performance obligations, changes in contract assets and liabilities and disaggregation of revenue.

NOTE 2.  INCOME TAXES

The following table summarizes income before income taxes:



Income tax expense (benefit) consists of the following:

A reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to the effective tax rate was as follows:

Our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Legislation)

, which changed the U.S. statutory rate to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018 and requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain previously undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries and foreign joint ventures that were tax deferred. Our effective tax rate for


was

58.0

percent

compared to

24.6

percent

for


. The impacts of the Tax Legislation resulted in additional tax expense of

$


million

.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued guidance which addressed the uncertainty in the application of GAAP to the Tax Legislation where certain income tax effects cannot be finalized at December 31, 2017. This guidance allows entities to record provisional amounts based on current estimates that are updated on a quarterly basis. As a result, our accounting for the effects of the Tax Legislation are not considered complete at this time. The final transition impacts of the Tax Legislation may differ from our estimates, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations of the Tax Legislation, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the Tax Legislation, any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the Tax Legislation, or any updates or changes to estimates the company has utilized to calculate the transition impacts. The SEC requires final calculations to be completed within the one year measurement period ending December 22, 2018, and reflect any additional guidance issued throughout the year. Any adjustments of provisional amounts will be reported in continuing operations in the period in which the estimates change. We have made provisional estimates of the effects of the Tax Legislation in three primary areas: (1) our existing deferred tax balances; (2) the one-time transition tax and (3) the withholding tax accrued on those earnings no longer considered permanently reinvested at December 31, 2017. Each of these items is described in more detail below.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities

We remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21 percent. We are still analyzing certain aspects of the Tax Legislation and refining our calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances. The provisional amount related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax balance is an incremental tax expense of

$


million

. See NOTE


, "

INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INVESTEES

," for the impact to our equity investees.



One-time transition tax

The one-time transition tax is based on our total post-1986 unrepatriated earnings and profits not previously subject to U.S. income tax. The recorded provisional amount for our one-time transition tax is a tax expense of

$


million

with a cash impact of

$


million

.

Withholding tax

Withholding tax is an additional cost associated with the distribution of earnings from some jurisdictions. As a result of the Tax Legislation, we reconsidered previous assertions regarding earnings that were considered permanently reinvested, which requires us to record withholding taxes on earnings likely to be distributed in the foreseeable future. The assertion as to which earnings are permanently reinvested for purposes of calculating withholding tax is provisional as we refine the underlying calculations of the amount of earnings subject to the tax and the rate at which it will be taxed. The recorded provisional amount for the withholding tax resulted in an incremental tax expense of

$


million

. See NOTE


, "

INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INVESTEES

," and NOTE


, "

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

," for the impact of withholding taxes to our equity investees and noncontrolling interests.

Carryforward tax benefits and the tax effect of temporary differences between financial and tax reporting that give rise to net deferred tax (liabilities) assets were as follows:

Our


U.S. carryforward benefits include

$


million

of state credit and net operating loss carryforward benefits that begin to expire in 2018. Our foreign carryforward benefits include

$


million

of net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2018. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the gross deferred tax assets to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. The valuation allowance was

$


million

and

increased

in


by a net

$


million

. The valuation allowance is primarily attributable to the uncertainty regarding the realization of a portion of the U.S. state and foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits.



Our

Consolidated Balance Sheets

contain the following tax related items:

A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended

December 31, 2017,


and


was as follows:

Included in the December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, balances are

$


million

,

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, related to tax positions that, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective tax rate in future periods. Also, we had accrued interest expense related to the unrecognized tax benefits of

$


million

,

$


million

and

$


million

as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized

$


million

,

$


million

and

$


million

in net interest expense, respectively.

Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. Although we believe that adequate provision has been made for such issues, there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on our earnings. Conversely, if these issues are resolved favorably in the future, the related provision would be reduced, thus having a positive impact on earnings.

As a result of our global operations, we file income tax returns in various jurisdictions including U.S. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. We are routinely subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, India, Mexico, the U.K. and the U.S. With few exceptions, our U.S. federal, major state and foreign jurisdictions are no longer subject to income tax assessments for years before 2013. The U.S. examinations related to tax years 2013-2015 concluded during 2017.



NOTE 3.  INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INVESTEES

Investments and advances related to equity method investees and our ownership percentage was as follows:

We have approximately

NOTE 4.  MARKETABLE SECURITIES

A summary of marketable securities, all of which are classified as current, was as follows:

______________________________________________________

(1)

All marketable securities are classified as Level 2 securities.

The fair value of Level 2 securities is

estimated using actively quoted prices for similar instruments from brokers and observable inputs where available, including market transactions and third-party pricing services, or net asset values provided to investors.

We do not currently have any Level 3 securities and there were no transfers between Level 2 or 3 during 2017 or 2016.

A description of the valuation techniques and inputs used for our Level 2 fair value measures was as follows:

•

Debt mutual funds

— The fair value measure for the vast majority of these investments is the daily net asset value published on a regulated governmental website. Daily quoted prices are available from the issuing brokerage and are used on a test basis to corroborate this Level 2 input.

•

Bank debentures and Certificates of deposit

— These investments provide us with a contractual rate of return and generally range in maturity from

three months

to

five years

. The counterparties to these investments are reputable financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. Since these instruments are not tradable and must be settled directly by us with the respective financial institution, our fair value measure is the financial institutions’ month-end statement.



•

Equity mutual funds

— The fair value measure for these investments is the net asset value published by the issuing brokerage. Daily quoted prices are available from reputable third party pricing services and are used on a test basis to corroborate this Level 2 input measure.

•

Government debt securities

— The fair value measure for these securities is broker quotes received from reputable firms. These securities are infrequently traded on a national stock exchange and these values are used on a test basis to corroborate our Level 2 input measure.

The proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities and gross realized gains from the sale of available-for-sale (AFS) securities were as follows:

____________________________________________________

(1)

Gross realized losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities were immaterial.

NOTE 9.  DEBT

Loans Payable and Commercial Paper

Loans payable at December 31,


and


were

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, and consisted primarily of notes payable to financial institutions.

The weighted-average interest rate for notes payable, bank overdrafts and current maturities of long-term debt at December 31 was as follows:



We can issue up to $1.75 billion of unsecured short-term promissory notes ("commercial paper") pursuant to our board authorized commercial paper programs. The programs facilitate the private placement of unsecured short-term debt through third party brokers. We intend to use the net proceeds from the commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes.

We had

$


million

in outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs at December 31,


, with a weighted-average interest rate of

1.56

percent

.

Revolving Credit Facilities

On November 13, 2015, we entered into an amended and restated five-year revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders, which provides us with a

$

1.75

billion

senior unsecured revolving credit facility and expires on November 13, 2020

. Amounts payable under our revolving credit facility will rank pro rata with all of our unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness. Up to

$


million

under our credit facility is available for swingline loans. Advances under the facility bear interest at (i) a base rate or (ii) a rate equal to the

LIBOR

rate plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of our outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt. Based on our current long-term debt ratings, the applicable margin on

LIBOR

rate loans was

0.75

percent

per annum at December 31,


. Advances under the facility may be prepaid without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs.

On September 5, 2017, we entered into a 364-day credit facility that allows us to borrow up to

$


billion

of additional unsecured funds at any time through September 2018.

These credit agreements include various covenants, including, among others, maintaining a leverage ratio of no more than

3.5

to 1.0. At December 31,


, we were in compliance with the covenants.

There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31,


. We intend to maintain credit facilities of a similar aggregate amount by renewing or replacing these facilities before expiration.

Revolving credit facilities are maintained primarily to provide backup liquidity for our commercial paper borrowings, letters of credit and general corporate purposes.

At December 31,


, we had

$


million

of commercial paper outstanding, which effectively reduced the

$

1.75

billion

available capacity under our five-year revolving credit facility to

$

1.45

billion

. At December 31, 2017, we also had

$


billion

available under our 364-day facility.

At December 31,


, we also had

$


million

available for borrowings under our international and other domestic credit facilities.

Long-term Debt

Principal payments required on long-term debt during the next five years are as follows:



Interest on the

$


million

aggregate principal amount

of

3.65

%

senior unsecured notes due in 2023 and the

$


million

aggregate principal amount

of

4.875

%

senior unsecured notes due in 2043 pay interest semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year.

Interest on the

6.75

%

debentures is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year.

Interest on the

$


million

7.125

%

debentures and

$


million

5.65

%

debentures is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The debentures are unsecured and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. We can redeem the

7.125

%

debentures and the

5.65

%

debentures at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the debenture holders are not penalized by the early redemption.

Our debt agreements contain several restrictive covenants. The most restrictive of these covenants applies to our revolving credit facility which will upon default, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional debt or issue preferred stock, enter into sale-leaseback transactions, sell or create liens on our assets, make investments and merge or consolidate with any other entity. In addition, we are subject to a maximum debt-to-EBITDA ratio financial covenant. At December 31,


, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our borrowing agreements.

Shelf Registration

As a well-known seasoned issuer, we filed an automatic shelf registration for an undetermined amount of debt and equity securities with the SEC on February 16, 2016. Under this shelf registration we may offer, from time to time, debt securities, common stock, preferred and preference stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units.

Interest

For the years ended December 31,


,


and


, total interest incurred was

$


million

,

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, and interest capitalized was

$


million

,

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively.

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. We manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of interest rate swaps. The objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk.

We have a series of interest rate swaps to effectively convert our September 2013,

$


million

debt issue, due in 2023, from a fixed rate of

3.65

percent

to a floating rate equal to the

one-month LIBOR

plus a spread.

The terms of the swaps mirror those of the debt, with interest paid semi-annually. The swaps were designated, and will be accounted for, as fair value hedges under GAAP. The gain or loss on these derivative instruments, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in current income as “Interest expense.” The net swap settlements that accrue each period are also reported in interest expense.

The following table summarizes these gains and losses for the years presented below:

___________________________________________

(1)

The difference between the gain/(loss) on swaps and borrowings represents hedge ineffectiveness.

Fair Value of Debt

Based on borrowing rates currently available to us for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities, considering our risk premium, the fair values and carrying values of total debt, including current maturities, were as follows:

___________________________________________

The fair value of debt is derived from Level 2 inputs.



NOTE 10.  PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

Pension Plans

We sponsor several contributory and noncontributory pension plans covering substantially all employees. Generally, hourly employee pension benefits are earned based on years of service and compensation during active employment while future benefits for salaried employees are determined using a cash balance formula. However, the level of benefits and terms of vesting may vary among plans. Pension plan assets are administered by trustees and are principally invested in fixed income securities and equity securities. It is our policy to make contributions to our various qualified plans in accordance with statutory and contractual funding requirements and any additional contributions we determine are appropriate.

Obligations, Assets and Funded Status

Benefit obligation balances presented below reflect the projected benefit obligation (PBO) for our pension plans.

The changes in the benefit obligations, the various plan assets, the funded status of the plans and the amounts recognized in our

Consolidated Balance Sheets

for our significant pension plans at December 31 were as follows:

In addition to the pension plans in the above table, we also maintain less significant defined benefit pension plans primarily in


other countries outside of the U.S. and the U.K. that comprise approximately


percent

and


percent

of our pension plan assets and obligations

, respectively at

December 31, 2017

. These plans are reflected in "Other liabilities and deferred revenue" on our

Consolidated Balance Sheets

. In 2017, we made

$


million

of contributions to these plans.



The following table presents information regarding total accumulated benefit obligation, PBO's and underfunded pension plans that are included in the preceding table:

Components of Net Periodic Pension Cost

The following table presents the net periodic pension cost under our plans for the years ended December 31:

Other changes in benefit obligations and plan assets recognized in other comprehensive income for the years ended December 31 were as follows:

The amount in accumulated other comprehensive loss expected to be recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost during the next fiscal year is a net actuarial loss of

$


million

.

Assumptions

The table below presents various assumptions used in determining the PBO for each year and reflects weighted-average percentages for the various plans as follows:



The table below presents various assumptions used in determining the net periodic pension cost and reflects weighted-average percentages for the various plans as follows:

Plan Assets

Our investment policies in the U.S. and U.K. provide for the rebalancing of assets to maintain our long-term strategic asset allocation. We are committed to this long-term strategy and do not attempt to time the market given empirical evidence that asset allocation is more critical than individual asset or investment manager selection. Rebalancing of the assets has and continues to occur. The rebalancing is critical to having the proper weighting of assets to achieve the expected total portfolio returns. We believe that our portfolio is highly diversified and does not have any significant exposure to concentration risk. The plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans do not include any of our common stock.

U.S. Plan Assets

For the U.S. qualified pension plans, our assumption for the expected return on assets was

7.25

percent

in


. Projected returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management. We expect additional positive returns from this active investment management. Based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations in a rising interest rate environment, we have elected to reduce our assumption to

6.50

percent

in


.

The primary investment objective is to exceed, on a net-of-fee basis, the rate of return of a policy portfolio comprised of the following:

The fixed income component is structured to represent a custom bond benchmark that will closely hedge the change in the value of our liabilities. This component is structured in such a way that its benchmark covers approximately


percent

of the plan's exposure to changes in its discount rate (AA corporate bond yields). In order to achieve a hedge on more than the targeted


percent

of plan assets invested in fixed income securities, our Benefits Policy Committee (BPC) permits the fixed income managers, other managers or the custodian/trustee to utilize derivative securities, as part of a liability driven investment strategy to further reduce the plan's risk of declining interest rates. However, all managers hired to manage assets for the trust are prohibited from using leverage unless specifically discussed with the BPC and approved in their guidelines.

U.K. Plan Assets

For the U.K. qualified pension plans, our assumption for the expected return on assets was

4.5

percent

in


. The methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the U.K. was based on establishing an equity-risk premium over current long-term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations. Our strategy with respect to our investments in these assets is to be invested in a suitable mixture of return-seeking assets such as equities, real estate and liability matching assets such as group annuity insurance contracts and duration matched bonds. Therefore, the risk and return balance of our U.K. asset portfolio should reflect a long-term horizon.

To achieve these objectives we have established the following targets:



As part of our strategy in the U.K. we have not prohibited the use of any financial instrument, including derivatives. As in the U.S. plan, derivatives may be used to better match liability duration and are not used in a speculative way. The

56.5

percent

fixed income component is structured in a way that covers approximately


percent

of the plan's exposure to changes in its discount rate. Based on the above discussion, we have elected an assumption of

4.00

percent

in


.

Fair Value of U.S. Plan Assets

The fair values of U.S. pension plan assets by asset category were as follows:



____________________________________________________

(1)

Cash equivalents include commercial paper, short-term government/agency, mortgage and credit instruments.

The reconciliation of Level 3 assets was as follows:

Level 3 Assets

The investments in an insurance contract, venture capital, private equity, opportunistic credit and real estate funds, for which quoted market prices are not available, are valued at their estimated fair value as determined by applicable investment managers or by quarterly financial statements of the funds. These financial statements are audited at least annually. In conjunction with our investment consultant, we monitor the fair value of the insurance contract as periodically reported by our insurer and their counterparty risk. The fair value of all real estate properties, held in the partnerships, are valued at least once per year by an independent professional real estate valuation firm. Fair value generally represents the fund's proportionate share of the net assets of the investment partnerships as reported by the general partners of the underlying partnerships. Some securities with no readily available market are initially valued at cost, utilizing independent professional valuation firms as well as market comparisons with subsequent adjustments to values which reflect either the basis of meaningful third-party transactions in the private market or the fair value deemed appropriate by the general partners of the underlying investment partnerships. In such instances, consideration is also given to the financial condition and operating results of the issuer, the amount that the investment partnerships can reasonably expect to realize upon the sale of the securities and any other factors deemed relevant. The estimated fair values are subject to uncertainty and therefore may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market for such investments existed and such differences could be material.

Other Postretirement Benefits

Our other postretirement benefit plans provide various health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees, who retire and satisfy certain age and service requirements, and their dependents. The plans are contributory and contain cost-sharing features such as caps, deductibles, coinsurance and spousal contributions. Employer contributions are limited by formulas in each plan. Retiree contributions for health care benefits are adjusted annually, and we reserve the right to change benefits covered under these plans. There were no plan assets for the postretirement benefit plans as our policy is to fund benefits and expenses for these plans as claims and premiums are incurred.

Obligations and Funded Status

Benefit obligation balances presented below reflect the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations (APBO) for our other postretirement benefit plans.

The changes in the benefit obligations, the funded status of the plans and the amounts recognized in our

Consolidated Balance Sheets

for our significant other postretirement benefit plans were as follows:

In addition to the other postretirement plans in the above table, we also maintain less significant postretirement plans in

four

other countries outside the U.S. that comprise approximately


percent

and


percent

of our postretirement obligations at December 31,


and


, respectively. These plans are reflected in "Other liabilities and deferred revenue" in our

Consolidated Balance Sheets

Components of Net Periodic Other Postretirement Benefits Cost

The following table presents the net periodic other postretirement benefits cost under our plans:

Other changes in benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income for the years ended December 31 were as follows:

The amount in accumulated other comprehensive loss expected to be recognized as a component of net periodic other postretirement benefit cost during the next fiscal year is approximately

Assumptions

The table below presents assumptions used in determining the other postretirement benefit obligation for each year and reflects weighted-average percentages for our other postretirement plans as follows:

The table below presents assumptions used in determining the net periodic other postretirement benefits cost and reflects weighted-average percentages for the various plans as follows:

Our consolidated other postretirement benefit obligation is determined by application of the terms of health care and life insurance plans, together with relevant actuarial assumptions and health care cost trend rates. For measurement purposes, an

8.00

percent

annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed in


. The rate is assumed to decrease on a linear basis to

5.00

percent

through 2026 and remain at that level thereafter. An increase in the health care cost trends of 1 percent would increase our APBO by

$


million

at December 31,

NOTE 12.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

We are subject to numerous lawsuits and claims arising out of the ordinary course of our business, including actions related to product liability; personal injury; the use and performance of our products; warranty matters; product recalls; patent, trademark or other intellectual property infringement; contractual liability; the conduct of our business; tax reporting in foreign jurisdictions; distributor termination; workplace safety; and environmental matters. We also have been identified as a potentially responsible party at multiple waste disposal sites under U.S. federal and related state environmental statutes and regulations and may have joint and several liability for any investigation and remediation costs incurred with respect to such sites. We have denied liability with respect to many of these lawsuits, claims and proceedings and are vigorously defending such lawsuits, claims and proceedings. We carry various forms of commercial, property and casualty, product liability and other forms of insurance; however, such insurance may not be applicable or adequate to cover the costs associated with a judgment against us with respect to these lawsuits, claims and proceedings. We do not believe that these lawsuits are material individually or in the aggregate. While we believe we have also established adequate accruals pursuant to GAAP for our expected future liability with respect to pending lawsuits, claims and proceedings, where the nature and extent of any such liability can be reasonably estimated based upon then presently available information, there can be no assurance that the final resolution of any existing or future lawsuits, claims or proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

We conduct significant business operations in Brazil that are subject to the Brazilian federal, state and local labor, social security, tax and customs laws. While we believe we comply with such laws, they are complex, subject to varying interpretations and we are often engaged in litigation regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances.

Loss Contingencies

Third Party Aftertreatment

Engine systems sold in the U.S. must be certified to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and California Air Resources Board (CARB) emission standards. EPA and CARB regulations require that in-use testing be performed on vehicles by the emission certificate holder and reported to the EPA and CARB in order to ensure ongoing compliance with these emission standards. We are the holder of this emission certificate for our engines, including engines installed in certain vehicles with one customer for which we did not also manufacture or sell the emission aftertreatment system. During 2015, a quality issue in certain of these third party aftertreatment systems caused some of our inter-related engines to fail in-use emission testing. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the vehicle manufacturer made a request that we assist in the design and bear the financial cost of a field campaign (Campaign) to address the technical issue purportedly causing some vehicles to fail the in-use testing.

As the certificate holder, we recorded a charge of

$


million

in 2015 for the expected cost of the proposed voluntary Campaign.

The Campaign design was finalized with our original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customer, reviewed with the EPA and submitted for final approval in 2016.

We concluded based upon additional in-use emission testing performed in 2016 that the Campaign should be expanded to include a larger population of vehicles manufactured by this one OEM. We recorded additional charges of

$


million

in 2016 to reflect the estimated cost of our overall participation in the Campaign.



In late 2016, litigation arose with our OEM customer regarding cost allocation for this Campaign.

In January 2018, a settlement was reached with our customer to fully resolve this matter, which resulted in an incremental charge of

$


million

recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017.

These charges are reflected in a separate line item on our

Consolidated Statements of Income

.

Engine System

During 2017, the CARB and U.S. EPA selected certain of our pre-2013 model year engine systems for additional emissions testing. Some of these engine systems failed CARB and EPA's tests as a result of degradation of an aftertreatment component. We have not been issued an official notice from the CARB or EPA regarding these particular engine systems. We are working with the agencies and will meet with them beginning in the first quarter of 2018, to develop a resolution of these matters. We are developing and testing a variety of solutions to address the technical issues, which could include a combination of calibration changes, service practices and hardware changes.

We recorded a charge of

$


million

to "cost of sales" in our

Consolidated Statements of Income

in the third quarter of 2017 for the expected cost of field campaigns to repair some of these engine systems.

In addition, we continue to evaluate other engine systems for model years 2010 through 2015 that could potentially be subject to similar aftertreatment component degradation issues.  At the close of 2017, we had not yet determined the impact to other model years or engine systems or the percentage of the engine system populations that could be affected.

Since there are many unresolved variables with respect to these degradation issues, we are not yet able to estimate the financial impact of these matters. It is possible that they could have a material impact on our results of operations in the periods in which these degradation issues are resolved and a solution is determined.

We do not currently expect any fines or penalties from the EPA or CARB related to this matter.

Guarantees and Commitments

Periodically, we enter into guarantee arrangements, including guarantees of non-U.S. distributor financings, residual value guarantees on equipment under operating leases and other miscellaneous guarantees of joint ventures or third-party obligations. At December 31, 2017, the maximum potential loss related to these guarantees

was

$


million

.

We have arrangements with certain suppliers that require us to purchase minimum volumes or be subject to monetary penalties. At December 31, 2017, if we were to stop purchasing from each of these suppliers, the aggregate amount of the penalty would be approximately

$


million

, of which

$


million

relates to a contract with a components supplier that extends to 2018 and

$


million

relates to a contract with a power systems supplier that extends to 2019. Most of these arrangements enable us to secure critical components. We do not currently anticipate paying any penalties under these contracts.

We enter into physical forward contracts with suppliers of platinum, palladium and copper to purchase minimum volumes of the commodities at contractually stated prices for various periods, not to exceed

two years

. At December 31, 2017, the total commitments under these contracts were

$


million

. These arrangements enable us to fix the prices of these commodities, which otherwise are subject to market volatility.

We have guarantees with certain customers that require us to satisfactorily honor contractual or regulatory obligations, or compensate for monetary losses related to nonperformance. These performance bonds and other performance-related guarantees were

$


million

at December 31,


.

Periodically, we enter into various contractual arrangements where we agree to indemnify a third-party against certain types of losses. Common types of indemnities include:

•

product liability and license, patent or trademark indemnifications;

•

asset sale agreements where we agree to indemnify the purchaser against future environmental exposures related to the asset sold; and

•

any contractual agreement where we agree to indemnify the counterparty for losses suffered as a result of a misrepresentation in the contract.

We regularly evaluate the probability of having to incur costs associated with these indemnities and accrue for expected losses that are probable. Because the indemnifications are not related to specified known liabilities and due to their uncertain nature, we are unable to estimate the maximum amount of the potential loss associated with these indemnifications.



Leases

We lease certain manufacturing equipment, facilities, warehouses, office space and equipment, aircraft and automobiles for varying periods under lease agreements. Most of the leases are non-cancelable operating leases with fixed rental payments, expire over the next


years

and contain renewal provisions.

Rent expense under these leases was as follows:

The following is a summary of the leased property under capital leases by major classes:

NOTE 13.  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

Preferred and Preference Stock

We are authorized to issue

one million

shares each of zero par value preferred and preference stock with preferred shares being senior to preference shares. We can determine the number of shares of each series, and the rights, preferences and limitations of each series. At December 31,


, there was no preferred or preference stock outstanding.



Common Stock

Changes in shares of common stock, treasury stock and common stock held in trust for employee benefit plans were as follows:

Treasury Stock

Shares of common stock repurchased by us are recorded at cost as treasury stock and result in a reduction of shareholders' equity in our

Consolidated Balance Sheets

. Treasury shares may be reissued as part of our stock-based compensation programs. When shares are reissued, we use the weighted-average cost method for determining cost. The gains between the cost of the shares and the issuance price are added to additional paid-in-capital. The losses are deducted from additional paid-in capital to the extent of the gains. Thereafter, the losses are deducted from retained earnings. Treasury stock activity for the three-year period ended December 31,


, consisting of shares issued and repurchased is presented in our

Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity

.

In December 2016, our Board of Directors authorized the acquisition of up to

$


billion

of additional common stock upon completion of the 2015 repurchase plan.

In


, we made the following purchases under the 2015 purchase programs:

___________________________________________

The remaining authorized capacity under the 2015 plan was calculated based on the cost to purchase the shares but excludes commission expenses in accordance with the authorized plan.

In 2016, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a third party financial institution to repurchase

$


million

of our common stock under our previously announced share repurchase plans and received

4.7

Employee Benefits Trust

In 1997, we established the Employee Benefits Trust (EBT) funded with common stock for use in meeting our future obligations under employee benefit and compensation plans. The primary sources of cash for the EBT are dividends received on unallocated shares of our common stock held by the EBT. The EBT may be used to fund matching contributions to employee accounts in the 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) made in proportion to employee contributions under the terms of the RSP. In addition, we may direct the trustee to sell shares of the EBT on the open market to fund other non-qualified employee benefit plans.

NOTE 15.  STOCK INCENTIVE AND STOCK OPTION PLANS

In May of 2017 the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the shareholder approved stock incentive plan (the Plan) to increase the number of available shares. The revised Plan allows for the granting of up to

8.5

million

total shares of equity awards to executives, employees and non-employee directors. Awards available for grant under the Plan include, but are not limited to, stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance shares and other stock awards. Shares issued under the Plan may be newly issued shares or reissued treasury shares.

Stock options are generally granted with a strike price equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and a life of


years. Stock options granted have a three-year vesting period. The strike price may be higher than the fair value of the stock on the date of the grant, but cannot be lower. Compensation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the vesting period beginning on the grant date. The compensation expense is based on the fair value of each option grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Options granted to employees eligible for retirement under our retirement plan are fully expensed at the grant date.

Stock options are also awarded through the Key Employee Stock Investment Plan (KESIP) which allows certain employees, other than officers, to purchase shares of common stock on an installment basis up to an established credit limit. For every even block of


KESIP shares purchased by the employee


stock options are granted. The options granted through the KESIP program are considered awards under the Plan and are vested immediately. Compensation expense for stock options granted through the KESIP program is recorded based on the fair value of each option grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

Performance shares are granted as target awards and are earned based on our return on equity (ROE) performance. A payout factor has been established ranging from


to


percent

of the target award based on our actual ROE performance. Shares have a three-year performance period. The fair value of the award is equal to the average market price, adjusted for the present value of dividends over the vesting period, of our stock on the grant date. Compensation expense is recorded ratably over the period beginning on the grant date until the shares become unrestricted and is based on the amount of the award that is expected to be earned under the plan formula, adjusted each reporting period based on current information.

Restricted common stock is awarded from time to time at no cost to certain employees. Participants are entitled to cash dividends and voting rights. Restrictions limit the sale or transfer of the shares during a defined period. Generally,

one-third

of the shares become vested and free from restrictions after

two years

and

one-third

of the shares issued become vested and free from restrictions each year thereafter on the anniversary of the grant date, provided the participant remains an employee. The fair value of the award is equal to the average market price of our stock on the grant date. Compensation expense is determined at the grant date and is recognized over the restriction period on a straight-line basis.

Employee compensation expense (net of estimated forfeitures) related to our share-based plans for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, was approximately

$


million

,

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively. In addition, non-employee director share-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31,


,


and


, was approximately

$


million

,

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively. Shares granted to non-employee directors vest immediately and have no restrictions or performance conditions. The excess tax benefit associated with our employee share-based plans for the years ended December 31,


,


and


, was

$


million

,

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively. The total unrecognized compensation expense (net of estimated forfeitures) related to nonvested awards for our employee share-based plans was approximately

$


million

at December 31,


, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of less than

two years

.



The tables below summarize the employee share-based activity in the Plan:

The weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31,


,


and


, was

$

36.86

,

$

25.28

and

$

35.25

, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31,


,


and


, was approximately

$


million

,

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively.

The weighted-average grant date fair value of performance and restricted shares was as follows:

The total vesting date fair value of performance shares vested during the years ended December 31,


,


and


was

$


million

,

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively. The total fair value of restricted shares vested was less than

$


million

,

$


million

and

$


million

for the years ended December 31,


,


and


, respectively.



The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:

Expected life

—The expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding based upon our historical data.

Risk-free interest rate

—The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon the observed U.S. treasury security rate appropriate for the expected life of our employee stock options.

Expected volatility

—The expected volatility assumption is based upon the weighted-average historical daily price changes of our common stock over the most recent period equal to the expected option life of the grant, adjusted for activity which is not expected to occur in the future.

Dividend yield

—The dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts.

NOTE 17.  EARNINGS PER SHARE

We calculate basic earnings per share (EPS) of common stock by dividing net income attributable to Cummins Inc. by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The calculation of diluted EPS assumes the issuance of common stock for all potentially dilutive share equivalents outstanding. We exclude shares of common stock held in the Employee Benefits Trust (EBT) (see Note


, "

SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

") from the calculation of the weighted-average common shares outstanding until those shares are distributed from the EBT to the Retirement Savings Plan.

Following are the computations for basic and diluted earnings per share:

The weighted-average diluted common shares outstanding excludes the anti-dilutive effect of certain stock options since such options had an exercise price in excess of the monthly average market value of our common stock.

The options excluded from diluted earnings per share were as follows:

All results from acquired entities (excluding Brammo Inc.) were included in segment results subsequent to the acquisition date. Previously consolidated entities were accounted for as equity transactions (EQUITY). Newly consolidated entities were accounted for as business combinations (COMB) with gains recognized based on the requirement to remeasure our pre-existing ownership to fair value in accordance with GAAP and are included in the

Consolidated Statements of Income

as "

Other income, net

. The Brammo Inc. acquisition had not yet been assigned to a reportable segment at December 31, 2017.

(2)

Intangible assets acquired in business combinations were mostly customer and technology related, the majority of which will be amortized over a period of`up to


years

from the date of the acquisition.

(3)

The "Total Purchase Consideration" represents the total amount that will or is estimated to be paid to complete the acquisition. A portion of the Brammo Inc. acquisition payment has not yet been made and will be paid in future periods in accordance with the purchase contract. The Brammo Inc. acquisition contains an earnout based on future results of the acquired business and could result in a maximum contingent consideration payment of

$


million (fair value of

$


million) to the former owners.

(4)

This transaction created a newly formed joint venture that we consolidated. See additional information below.

(5)

Sales amounts are not fully incremental to our consolidated sales as the amount would be reduced by the elimination of sales to the previously unconsolidated entity.



Eaton Cummins Automated Transmission Technologies

In April 2017, we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture with Eaton Corporation PLC (Eaton), which closed on July 31, 2017 (the acquisition date). We purchased a


percent

interest in the new venture named Eaton Cummins Automated Transmission Technologies (ECJV) for

$


million

in cash. In addition, each partner contributed

$


million

for working capital. The joint venture will design, assemble, sell and support medium-duty and heavy-duty automated transmissions for the commercial vehicle market, including new product launches.

The new generation products (Procision and Endurant) were launched in 2016 and 2017, respectively, and are owned by the joint venture. Eaton will continue to manufacture and sell the old generation products to the joint venture which will be marked up and sold to end customers. Eaton will also sell certain transmission components to the joint venture at prices approximating market rates. In addition, Eaton will provide certain manufacturing and administrative services to the joint venture, including but not limited to manufacturing labor in Mexico, information technology services, accounting services and purchasing services, at prices approximating market rates. Pro forma financial information was not provided as historical activity related to the products contributed to the joint venture was not material.

We consolidated the results of the joint venture in our Components segment as we have a majority voting interest in the venture by virtue of a tie-breaking vote on the joint venture's board of directors.

The joint venture had an enterprise value at inception of

$

1.2

billion

. Due to the structure of the joint venture and equal sharing of economic benefits, we did not apply a discount for lack of control to the noncontrolling interests.

The final purchase price allocation was as follows:

Customer relationship

assets represent the value of the long-term strategic relationship the business has with its significant customers, which we are amortizing over


years. The assets were valued using an income approach, specifically the "multi-period excess earnings" method, which identifies an estimated stream of revenues and expenses for a particular group of assets from which deductions of portions of the projected economic benefits, attributable to assets other than the subject asset (contributory assets), are deducted in order to isolate the prospective earnings of the subject asset. This value is considered a level 3 measurement under the GAAP fair value hierarchy. Key assumptions used in the valuation of customer relationships include: (1) a rate of return of


percent

and (2) an attrition rate of


percent

.

Technology

assets primarily represent the associated patents and know how related to the Endurant and Procision next generation automated transmissions, which we are amortizing over


years. These assets were valued using the "relief-from-royalty" method, which is a combination of both the income approach and market approach that values a subject asset based on an estimate of the "relief" from the royalty expense that would be incurred if the subject asset were licensed from a third party. Key assumptions impacting this value include: (1) a market royalty rate of


percent

, (2) a rate of return of


percent

and (3) an economic depreciation rate of

7.5

percent

. This value is considered a level 3 measurement under the GAAP fair value hierarchy. Annual amortization of the intangible assets for the next


years is expected to approximate

$


million

.

Goodwill

was determined based on the residual difference between the fair value of consideration transferred and the value assigned to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. Approximately

$


million

of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. Among the factors contributing to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill is the ability to integrate and optimize the engine and transmission development to deliver the world’s best power train, to realize synergies in service and aftermarket growth and to utilize our strength in international markets where automated transmission adoption rates are very low.

Included in our 2017 results were revenues of

$


million

and a net loss of

$


million

related to this joint venture.



NOTE 19.  IMPAIRMENT OF LIGHT-DUTY DIESEL ASSETS

We began development of a new North American light-duty diesel engine (LDD) platform in July of 2006 for use in a variety of on and off-highway applications. At December 31, 2015, we had capitalized investments of approximately

$


million

, with a net book value prior to the impairment of

$


million

(

$


million

of which was in our Engine segment and

$


million

of which was in our Components segment). Market uncertainty due to the global recession in 2008/2009 resulted in some customers delaying or canceling their vehicle programs, while others remained active. We announced an agreement with Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. in 2013 to supply our light-duty diesel engine and began commercial shipment in 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we learned that we were not successful in our bid to supply this product for an additional customer. In addition, the deterioration in global economic conditions and excess manufacturing capacity in other markets made it unlikely that we would manufacture additional products on the LDD line to utilize its excess capacity during the asset recovery period. As a result, we concluded that the combination of these events presented a triggering event requiring an assessment of the recoverability of these assets in the fourth quarter of 2015. The assessment indicated that the projected undiscounted cash flows related to this asset group were not sufficient to recover its carrying value. Consequently, we were required to write down the LDD asset group to fair value. Our 2015 fourth quarter results included an impairment charge of

$


million

(

$


million

after-tax), of which

$


million

was in the Engine segment and

$


million

was in the Components segment, to reflect the assets at fair value.

We remain committed to servicing existing contracts and are not exiting this product line.

The fair value of the asset group was estimated to be

$


million

(

$


million

for the Engine segment and

$


million

for the Components segment) at December 31, 2015 and was calculated primarily using a cost approach with consideration of a market approach where secondary market information was available for the type and age of these assets. In the application of the market approach, we determined that the liquidation value in-place reflected the best estimate of fair value. In the application of the cost approach we considered the current cost of replacing the assets with a reduction for physical deterioration given the age of the assets and a reduction for functional and economic obsolescence in the form of a discount reflecting the current and projected under-utilization of the assets. The fair value of these assets are considered Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy as they are either derived from unobservable inputs or have significant adjustments to the observable inputs.

NOTE 20.  RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND OTHER CHARGES

We executed restructuring actions primarily in the form of professional voluntary and involuntary employee separation programs in the fourth quarter of 2015. These actions were in response to the continued deterioration in our global markets in the second half of 2015, as well as expected reductions in orders in most U.S. and global markets in 2016. We reduced our worldwide workforce by approximately

1,900

employees

, including approximately


employees accepting voluntary retirement packages with the remainder of the reductions being involuntary.

We incurred a charge of

$


million

(

$


million

after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2015, of which

$


million

related to severance costs for both voluntary and involuntary terminations and

$


million

for asset impairments and other charges.

At December 31, 2017, all terminations were completed.



NOTE 21.  OPERATING SEGMENTS

Operating segments under GAAP are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our CODM is the President and Chief Operating Officer.

Our reportable operating segments consist of Engine, Distribution, Components and Power Systems. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves

. The Engine segment produces engines (15 liters and less in size) and associated parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various off-highway markets. Our engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well as in various industrial applications, including construction, agriculture, power generation systems and other off-highway applications. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMs throughout the world. The Components segment sells filtration products, aftertreatment systems, turbochargers, fuel systems and transmissions. The Power Systems segment is an integrated power provider, which designs, manufactures and sells engines (16 liters and larger) for industrial applications (including mining, oil and gas, marine and rail), standby and prime power generator sets, alternators and other power components.

We use EBIT (defined as earnings before interest expense, income taxes and noncontrolling interests) as a primary basis for the CODM to evaluate the performance of each of our operating segments. Segment amounts exclude certain expenses not specifically identifiable to segments.

The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those applied in our

Consolidated Financial Statements

.

We prepared the financial results of our operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We allocate certain common costs and expenses, primarily corporate functions, among segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These include certain costs and expenses of shared services, such as information technology, human resources, legal, finance and supply chain management. We do not allocate debt-related items, actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, changes in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance or income taxes to individual segments.

EBIT may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.



Summarized financial information regarding our reportable operating segments at December 31, is shown in the table below:

SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA

UNAUDITED

___________________________________________________

(1)

Net income attributable to Cummins Inc. and earnings per share were negatively impacted by a

$


million

tax adjustment related to The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December of 2017. For the fourth quarter of 2017, results for basic and diluted earnings per share were reduced by

$

4.70

per share and

$

4.68

per share, respectively, due to tax reform.

(2)

Earnings per share in each quarter is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during that quarter while earnings per share for the full year is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the year. Thus, the sum of the four quarters earnings per share may not equal the full year earnings per share.

(3)

The second quarter of 2016 included a

$


million

loss contingency charge (

$


million

after-tax). The third quarter of 2016 included an additional

$


million

loss contingency charge (

$


million

net of favorable compensation impact and after-tax).

At December 31,


, there were approximately

3,362

holders of record of Cummins Inc.'s $2.50 par value common stock.
