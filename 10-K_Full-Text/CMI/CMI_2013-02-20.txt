providing new products, technical support, tools, training, parts and product information.

In
addition to managing our involvement with our wholly-owned and partially-owned distributors, our Distribution segment is responsible for managing the performance and capabilities of
our independent distributors. Our Distribution segment serves a highly diverse customer base with approximately 45 percent of its 2012 sales being generated from new engines and power
generation equipment, compared to 47 percent in 2011, with its remaining sales generated by parts and filtration and service revenue.

Financial
information about our distributors accounted for under the equity method are incorporated by reference from Note 3, "INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INVESTEES," to our

Consolidated Financial Statements

.

Our
distributors compete with distributors or dealers that offer similar products. In many cases, these competing distributors or dealers are owned by, or affiliated with the companies
that are listed above as competitors of our Engine, Components or Power Generation segments. These competitors vary by geographical location.

In
July 2012, we acquired an additional 45 percent interest in Cummins Central Power from the former principal for consideration of approximately $20 million. The
acquisition was accounted for as a business combination, with the results of the acquired entity included in the Distribution operating segment in the third quarter of 2012. Distribution segment
results also included a $7 million gain, as we were required to re-measure our pre-existing 35 percent ownership interest in Cummins Central Power to fair value
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United State of America (GAAP). See Note 2, "ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES," to our

Consolidated
Financial Statements

for additional detail.

JOINT VENTURES, ALLIANCES AND NON-WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES

We have entered into a number of joint venture agreements and alliances with business partners around the world. Our joint ventures are
either distribution or manufacturing entities. We also own controlling interests in non-wholly-owned manufacturing and distribution subsidiaries. Seven entities, in



which
we own more than a 50 percent equity interest, are consolidated in our Distribution segment results as well as several manufacturing joint ventures in the other operating segments.

In
the event of a change of control of either party to certain of these joint ventures and other strategic alliances, certain consequences may result including automatic termination and
liquidation of the venture, exercise of "put" or "call" rights of ownership by the non-acquired partner, termination or transfer of technology license rights to the
non-acquired partner and increases in component transfer prices to the acquired partner. We will continue to evaluate joint venture and partnership opportunities in order to penetrate new
markets, develop new products and generate manufacturing and operational efficiencies.

Brunswick Corporation, to develop, manufacture and sell recreational marine diesel products, including engines, sterndrive packages, inboard packages, instrument and controls, service systems and
replacement and service parts and assemblies, complete integration systems and other related products. In April 2012, we executed our plans to dissolve the joint venture and to transition to a
strategic supply arrangement between the two companies to more effectively and efficiently serve customers in the global diesel marine market. All business activities were moved from CMD to the parent
companies at the time of the dissolution. We will continue to use Mercury Marine drives and control systems in conjunction with its extensive offering of mid-range and
heavy-duty marine engines. The dissolution of the joint venture did not have a significant impact on our financial results.

Non-Wholly-Owned Subsidiary

We have a controlling interest in Cummins India Ltd. (CIL), which is a publicly listed company on various stock exchanges in
India. CIL produces mid-range, heavy-duty and high-horsepower engines, generators for the Indian and export markets and natural gas spark-ignited engines for power
generation, automotive and industrial applications. CIL also has distribution and power generation



operations.
CIL's net income attributable to Cummins was $42 million, $44 million and $46 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

SUPPLY

The performance of the end-to-end supply chain, extending through to our suppliers, is foundational to our
ability to meet customers' expectations and support long-term growth. In order to ensure we meet the needs of our customers, we are committed to having a robust strategy for how we select
and manage our suppliers.

We
have a strategic sourcing policy that guides decisions on what we make, when we establish supplier partnerships and what we purchase. Today we machine and assemble strategic
components used in our engines and power generation units, including blocks, heads, turbochargers, connecting rods, camshafts, crankshafts, filters, alternators and fuel systems. We source externally
purchased material and manufactured components from leading suppliers both domestically and internationally. Many suppliers are managed though long-term agreements that assure capacity,
delivery, quality and cost requirements are met over an extended period. We have a "take or pay" contract with an emission solutions business supplier requiring us to purchase approximately
$73 million annually through 2018. Approximately 60 to 70 percent of the total types of parts in our product designs are single sourced. Although we elect to source a relatively high
proportion of our total raw materials and components from sole suppliers, we have an established annual sourcing strategy process that evaluates risk. This annual review process has led us to begin
increasing our use of dual sourcing to both minimize risk and increase supply chain responsiveness.

Other
important elements of our sourcing strategy include:

•

working with suppliers to measure and improve their environmental footprint;

•

selecting and managing suppliers to comply with our supplier code of conduct and

•

assuring our suppliers do not use restricted or prohibited materials in our products.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

We own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture. These patents and trademarks
were granted and registered over a period of years. Although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations, we do not believe any patent, group of patents, or
trademark (other than our leading brand house trademarks) is significant to our business.

SEASONALITY

While individual product lines may experience modest seasonal variation in production, there is no material effect on the demand for
the majority of our products on a quarterly basis with the exception that our Power Generation segment normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter due to general declines in
construction spending during this period and our Distribution segment normally experiences seasonal declines in its first quarter business activity due to holiday periods in Asia and Australia.

LARGEST CUSTOMERS

We have thousands of customers around the world and have developed long-standing business relationships with many of them.
PACCAR is our largest customer, accounting for approximately 13 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2012, compared to approximately 12 percent in 2011 and 7 percent in 2010.
We have long-term supply agreements with PACCAR for our heavy-duty ISX 15 liter



and
ISX 11.9 liter engines and our ISL 9 liter mid-range engine. While a significant number of our sales to PACCAR are under long-term supply agreements, these agreements
provide for particular engine requirements for specific vehicle models and not a specific volume of engines. PACCAR is our only customer accounting for more than 10 percent of our net sales in
2012. The loss of this customer or a significant decline in the production level of PACCAR vehicles that use our engines would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
condition. We have been an engine supplier to PACCAR for over 68 years. A summary of principal customers for each operating segment is included in our segment discussion.

In
addition to our agreement with PACCAR, we have long-term heavy-duty engine supply agreements with Volvo Trucks North America and Navistar International
Corporation and long-term mid-range supply agreements with Daimler Trucks North America, Ford and MAN. We also have an agreement with Chrysler to supply engines for its Ram
trucks. In our off-highway markets, we have various engine and component supply agreements ranging across our midrange and high-horsepower businesses with Komatsu Ltd.,
as well as various joint ventures and other license agreements in our Engine, Component and Distribution segments. Collectively, our net sales to these seven customers, including PACCAR, was
approximately 33 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2012, compared to approximately 31 percent in 2011 and 25 percent in 2010. Excluding PACCAR, net sales to individual
customers were less than 8 percent of our consolidated net sales to any single customer in 2012, compared to less than 6 percent in 2011 and less than 4 percent in 2010. These
agreements contain standard purchase and sale agreement terms covering engine and engine parts pricing, quality and delivery commitments, as well as engineering product support obligations. The basic
nature of our agreements with OEM customers is that they are long-term price and operations agreements that help assure the availability of our products to each customer through the
duration of the respective agreements. Agreements with most OEMs contain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach, change of
control or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party.

BACKLOG

Our 2012 lead times for the majority of our businesses improved from their 2011 levels. While we have supply agreements with some truck
and off-highway equipment OEMs, most of our business is transacted through open purchase orders. These open orders are historically subject to month-to-month
releases and are subject to cancellation on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE

In 2012, we increased our research, development and engineering expenses as we continued to invest in future critical technologies and
products. We will continue to make investments to improve our current technologies, continue to meet the future emission requirements around the world and improve fuel economy.

Our
research and development program is focused on product improvements, innovations and cost reductions for our customers. Research and development expenditures include salaries,
contractor fees, building costs, utilities, administrative expenses and allocation of corporate costs and are expensed, net of contract reimbursements, when incurred. Research and development
expenses, net of contract reimbursements, were $721 million in 2012, $621 million in 2011 and $402 million in 2010. Contract reimbursements were $86 million in 2012,
$75 million in 2011 and $68 million in 2010.

For
2011 and 2010, approximately $1 million and $38 million or less than 1 percent and 9 percent, respectively, of our research and development expenditures
were directly related to compliance with 2010 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emission standards. For 2012, 2011 and 2010,



approximately
$101 million, $104 million and $36 million or 14 percent, 17 percent and 9 percent, of our research and development expenditures were directly
related to compliance with 2013 EPA emission standards.

ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY

Our Environmental Sustainability principles attempt to positively impact the environment through the products that we make, how we use
our facilities and how we impact communities where we live and work. Our newly formed Corporate Action Committee for Environmental Sustainability is developing a global plan to more fully integrate
environmental stewardship across all of our businesses and functions. We continue to invest significantly to further reduce emissions from and increase the efficiency of our products. We attempt to
work collaboratively with customers to improve their fuel economy, reduce their carbon footprints and conserve other resources. Over the past four years, we believe that we have reduced
company-wide water usage intensity by approximately 45 percent, U.S.-wide process-derived hazardous waste generation by approximately 52 percent and
company-wide landfill waste by approximately 28 percent, all normalized to total work hours. We also have articulated our positions on key public policy issues and on a wide range
of environmental issues. We are actively engaged with regulatory, industry and other stakeholder groups around the world as GHG and fuel efficiency standards become more prevalent globally. For the
eighth consecutive year, we were named to the Dow Jones World Sustainability Index, which recognizes the top 10 percent of the world's largest 2,500 companies in economic, environmental and
social leadership. We were also named the top environmentally conscious industrial company in the U.S. in Newsweek's Green Rankings. Our Sustainability Report for 2011/2012 as well as an addendum of
more detailed environmental data is available on our website at www.cummins.com, although such report and addendum are not incorporated into this Form 10-K.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

Product Environmental Compliance

Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing
emission and noise. We have substantially increased our global environmental compliance presence and expertise to better prepare for, understand and ultimately meet emerging product environmental
regulations around the world. Our products comply with all current emission standards that the European Union (EU), EPA, the
California Air Resources Board (CARB) and other state and international regulatory agencies have established for heavy-duty on-highway diesel and gas engines and
off-highway engines. Our ability to comply with these and future emission standards is an essential element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets. We have made, and
will continue to make, significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards. Our failure to comply with these standards could result in adverse effects on our future financial
results.

EU and EPA Engine Certifications

The current on-highway emission standards came into effect in the EU on October 1, 2008 (Euro V) and
on January 1, 2010 for the EPA. To meet the more stringent heavy-duty on-highway emission standards, we used an evolution of our proven selective catalytic reduction
(SCR) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) technology solutions and refined them for the EU and EPA certified engines to maintain power and torque with substantial fuel economy improvement and
maintenance intervals comparable with our previous compliant engines. We offer a complete lineup of on-highway engines to meet the near-zero emission standards.
Mid-range and heavy-duty engines for EU and EPA require NOx aftertreatment. NOx reduction is achieved by an integrated technology solution comprised of the XPI High Pressure
Common Rail fuel system, SCR technology, next-generation cooled EGR, advanced



electronic
controls, proven air handling and the Cummins Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). The EU, EPA, and CARB have certified that our engines meet the current emission requirements. Emission
standards in international markets, including Japan, Mexico, Australia, Brazil, Russia, India and China are becoming more stringent. We believe that our experience in meeting the EU and EPA emission
standards leaves us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emission control capability grows.

We
have received certification from the EPA that we have met both the EPA 2013 and 2014 GHG regulations and rules. The EPA 2013 regulations add the requirement of On-Board
Diagnostics, which were introduced on the ISX15 in 2010, across the full on-highway product line in 2013 in addition to maintaining the same near-zero emission levels of NOx
and Particulate Matter (PM) required in 2010. On-Board Diagnostics provide enhanced service capability with standardized diagnostic trouble codes, service tool interface,
in-cab warning lamp and service information availability. The new GHG and fuel-efficiency regulations will be required for all heavy-duty diesel and natural gas
engines beginning in January 2014. Our GHG certification is the first engine certificate
issued by the EPA and uses the same proven base engine with the XPI fuel system, Variable Geometry Turbocharger (VGT™), Cummins Aftertreatment System with DPF and SCR technology and fully
integrated electronics.

Other Environmental Statutes and Regulations

Expenditures for environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the U.S. have not been a
substantial portion of our annual capital outlays and are not expected to be material in 2013. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations applicable to our
plants and operations.

In
the U.S., pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies and/or defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions, we have been identified as a potentially
responsible party (PRP) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended or similar state laws, at approximately 20 waste disposal sites. Based upon
our experiences at similar sites we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be significant. We have established accruals that we believe are adequate for our expected future
liability with respect to these sites.

In
addition, we have several other sites where we are working with governmental authorities on remediation projects. The costs for these remediation projects are not expected to be
material.

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2012, we employed approximately 46,000 persons worldwide. Approximately 15,750 of our employees worldwide are
represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2013 and 2015.

ITEM 1A.    Risk Factors

Set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are some of the principal risks and uncertainties
that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this Report and could individually, or in combination, have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. These risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this Report,
including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Our separate section above, "CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING
FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION," should be considered in addition to the following statements.

A sustained slowdown or significant downturn in our markets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

The global economy continued to slow throughout 2012 as we experienced declining demand in emerging markets, including Brazil and
China, and a decline in India as the result of foreign currency fluctuations. The developed economies, including the U.S. economy, experienced slowing demand as the year progressed and continued to
experience economic uncertainty driven by unresolved federal tax and budget issues, while Europe continued to struggle as the result of lingering high unemployment, concerns over European sovereign
debt issues and the tightening of government budgets. If the global economy or some of our significant markets encounter a sustained slowdown or our emerging markets, particularly China and Brazil,
don't recover to stronger growth rates; depending upon the length, duration and severity of such a slowdown, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow would almost certainly be
materially adversely affected. Specifically, our revenues would likely decrease, we may be forced to consider further restructuring actions, we may need to increase our allowance for doubtful
accounts, our days sales outstanding may increase and we could experience impairments to assets of certain of our businesses.

A slowdown in infrastructure development could adversely affect our business.

Infrastructure development has been a significant driver of our business in recent years, especially in the emerging markets of China
and Brazil. In 2012, infrastructure spending in emerging markets steadily declined throughout the year. General weakness in economic growth or the perception that infrastructure has been overbuilt
could lead to a further decline in infrastructure spending. Any sustained downturns in infrastructure development that result from these or other circumstances could adversely affect our business.

Unpredictability in the adoption, implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards by multiple jurisdictions around the world could adversely
affect our business.

Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emission and noise, including standards imposed by
the EPA, the European Union, state regulatory agencies (such as the CARB) and other regulatory agencies around the world. We have made, and will be required to continue to make, significant capital
and research expenditures to comply with these emission standards. Developing engines to meet numerous changing government regulatory requirements, with different implementation timelines and emission
requirements, makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets. In some cases,
we may be required to develop new products to comply with new regulations, particularly those relating to air emission. While we have met previous deadlines, our ability to comply with other existing
and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our position in the engine markets we serve. The successful development
and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks, such



as
delays in product development, cost over-runs and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties.

In
addition to these risks, the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards around the world is unpredictable and subject
to change, or delays which could result in the products we developed or modified to comply with these standards becoming unnecessary or becoming necessary later than expected and in some cases
negating our competitive advantage. This in turn can delay, diminish or eliminate the expected return on capital and research expenditures that we have invested in such products and may adversely
affect our perceived competitive advantage in being an early, advanced developer of compliant engines.

We derive significant income from investees that we do not directly control.

Our net income includes significant equity, royalty and interest income from investees that we do not directly control. For 2012, we
recognized $384 million of equity, royalty and interest income from investees, compared to $416 million in 2011. The majority of our equity, royalty and interest income from investees is
from our 11 unconsolidated North American distributors and from two of our joint ventures in China, Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. (DCEC) and Chongqing Cummins Engine
Company, Ltd. (CCEC). Our equity ownership interests in our unconsolidated North American distributors generally range from 30 percent to 50 percent. We have 50 percent
equity ownership interests in DCEC and CCEC. As a result, although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities, we do not unilaterally control their
management or their operations, which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these other entities. A significant reduction in the level of contribution
by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our truck manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) customers may not continue to outsource their engine supply needs.

Several of our engine customers, including PACCAR, Volvo AB, Navistar International Corporation and Chrysler, are truck manufacturers
or OEMs that manufacture engines for some of their own products. Despite their own engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine
production to us due to the quality of our engine products, our emission capabilities, our systems integration, their customers' preferences, their desire for cost reductions, their desire for
eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus. However, there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource, or outsource as much of, their engine
production in the future. Increased levels of OEM vertical integration could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers' business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another
engine manufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. Any significant
reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or OEM customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

A downturn in the North American truck industry or other factors negatively affecting any of our truck OEM customers could materially adversely impact our results of
operations.

We make significant sales of engines and components to a few large truck OEMs in North America. If the North American truck
market suffers a significant downturn, or if one of our large truck OEM customers experienced financial distress or bankruptcy, such circumstance would likely lead to significant reductions in our
revenues and earnings, commercial disputes, receivable collection issues, and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.



The discovery of any significant problems with our new engine platforms in North America could materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and
cash flow.

The EPA and CARB have certified all of our 2012/2013 on-highway and off-highway engines, which utilize SCR
technology to meet requisite emission levels. We introduced SCR technology into our engine platforms in 2010. The effective performance of SCR technology and the overall performance of these engine
platforms impact
a number of our operating segments and remain crucial to our success in North America. While these 2010 engine platforms have performed well in the field, the discovery of any significant problems in
these platforms could result in recall campaigns, increased warranty costs, reputational risk and brand risk, and could materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and
cash flow.

We are subject to currency exchange rate and other related risks.

We conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to
currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, since our financial statements are denominated in U.S.
dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. While we customarily enter into
financial transactions that attempt to address these risks and many of our supply agreements with customers include currency exchange rate adjustment provisions, there can be no assurance that
currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse
fluctuations in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

We
also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or
to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds
denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.

We are vulnerable to supply shortages from single-sourced suppliers.

During 2012, we single sourced approximately 60 to 70 percent of the total types of parts in our product designs. Any delay in
our suppliers' deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations, forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions. Delays may be caused by
factors affecting our suppliers, including capacity constraints, labor disputes, economic downturns, availability of credit, the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, suppliers'
allocations to other purchasers, weather emergencies, natural disasters or acts of war or terrorism. Any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to
our customers and our results of operations.

Our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs.

Our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames; however, the timing of material and
commodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions. Additionally, higher material and commodity costs around the
world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. While we customarily enter into financial transactions and contractual pricing adjustment provisions with our customers that attempt to
address some of these risks (notably with respect to copper, platinum and palladium), there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations.
In addition, while the use of commodity price hedging instruments may provide



us
with some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price. As a
result, higher material and commodity costs, as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices, could result in declining margins.

Our products are subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues.

Our products may be subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. Product recalls subject us to harm to our reputation,
loss of current and future customers, reduced revenue and product recall costs. Product recall costs are incurred when we decide, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to recall a product through a
formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue. Any significant product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We face significant competition in the markets we serve.

The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that
produce and sell similar products. We primarily compete in the market with diesel engines and related diesel products; however, new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline, natural gas and
other technologies and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies. Our products primarily compete
on the basis of price, performance, fuel economy, speed of delivery, quality and customer support. We also face competitors in some emerging markets who have established local practices and long
standing relationships with participants in these markets. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets.
For a more complete discussion of the competitive environment in which each of our segments operates, see "Operating Segments" in "Item 1 Business."

Increasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers' growth.

As our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope, they are increasingly seeking to export their products to
other countries. This has meant greater demand for our advanced engine technologies to help these customers meet the more stringent emissions requirements of developed markets, as well as greater
demand for access to our distribution systems for purposes of equipment servicing. As these emerging market customers enter into and begin to compete in more developed markets, they may increasingly
begin to compete with our existing customers in these markets. Our further aid to emerging market customers could adversely affect our relationships with developed market customers and, as a result,
we may be pressured to restrict sale or support of some of our products in the areas of increased competition. In addition, to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth in
demand, we may see little or no benefit from this type of expansion by our emerging market customers.

We are exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business.

Approximately 53 percent of our net sales for 2012 and 59 percent in 2011 were attributable to customers outside the U.S.
Accordingly, our business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries. These risks include:

•

the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;

•

trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;



•

the imposition of taxes on foreign income and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the U.S.;

•

the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions;

•

difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations;

•

required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; and

•

changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets.

As
we continue to operate our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. There can be no
assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us.

Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our
profitability.

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. Our income tax provision and cash tax liability in
the future could be adversely affected by changes in the distribution of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities,
changes to our assertions regarding permanent re-investment of our foreign earnings, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation
process. The carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the U.S., is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. We are also subject to ongoing tax
audits. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions
taken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. The amounts
ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material
impact on our tax provision.

We are exposed to risks arising from the price and availability of energy.

The level of demand for our products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of energy. High energy
costs generally drive greater demand for better fuel economy in almost all countries in which we operate. Some of our engine products have been developed with a primary purpose of offering fuel
economy improvements, and if energy costs decrease or increase less than expected, demand for these products may likewise decrease. The relative unavailability of electricity in some emerging market
countries also influences demand for our electricity generating products, such as our diesel generators. If these countries add energy capacity by expanding their power grids at a rate equal to or
faster than the growth in demand for energy, the demand for our generating products could also decrease or increase less than would otherwise be the case.

Our global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk.

Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the
world. Recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anti-corruption such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and
similar laws from other countries. Our numerous foreign subsidiaries, affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws, rules and business practices that



differ
from those of the U.S. The activities of these entities may not comply with U.S. laws or business practices or our Code of Business Conduct. Violations of these laws may result in severe
criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. We cannot predict the nature,
scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.

We face the challenge of accurately aligning our capacity with our demand.

We can experience capacity constraints and longer lead times for certain products in times of growing demand while we can also
experience idle capacity as economies slow or demand for certain products decline. Accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity have been, and will continue to
be, important factors in determining our results of operations. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase manufacturing capacity to a level that meets demand for our products, which could
prevent us from meeting increased customer demand and could harm our business. However, if we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity, we may have significantly underutilized assets and we
may experience reduced margins. If we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our business is exposed to risks of product liability claims.

We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products' failure to perform to
specification results or is alleged to result in property damage, bodily injury and/or death. We may experience material product liability losses in the future. While we maintain insurance coverage
with respect to certain product liability claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage
against product liability claims. In addition, product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time,
regardless of the ultimate outcome. An unsuccessful defense of a significant product liability claim could have a material adverse effect upon us. In addition, even if we are successful in defending
against a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us.

We may need to write off significant investments in our new North American light-duty diesel engine platform if customer commitments further deteriorate.

We began development of a new North American light-duty diesel engine platform in July 2006 to be used in a variety of
on- and off-highway applications. Since that time, and as of December 31, 2012, we have capitalized investments of approximately $233 million. Market uncertainty
due to the global recession resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs, while others remain active. If customer expectations or volume projections further deteriorate
from our current expected levels and we do not identify new customers, we may need to recognize an impairment charge and write the assets down to net realizable value.

Our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations.

Our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we
operate, including laws and regulations governing air emission, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. While we believe
that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with
respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations, under either



present
laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property. If a release of hazardous substances
occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount
of such liability could be material.

Significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations,
financial condition and cash flow.

We sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans. Our pension expense and
the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to
measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value. We could experience
increased pension expense due to a combination of factors, including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets, decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating
to the expected return on plan assets.

Significant
declines in future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets, which could result in increased pension expense in future
years and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Depending upon the severity of market declines and government regulatory changes, we may be legally obligated
to make pension payments in the U.S. and perhaps other countries and these contributions could be material.

We may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters.

As of December 31, 2012, we employed approximately 46,000 persons worldwide. Approximately 15,750 of our employees worldwide are
represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2013 and 2015. While we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages or
other labor matters, there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages, or other types of
conflicts with labor unions or our employees. Any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. In addition, many of our customers
and suppliers have unionized work forces. Work stoppages or slow-downs experienced by our customers or suppliers could result in slow-downs or closures that would have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.

Our financial statements are subject to changes in accounting standards that could adversely impact our profitability or financial position.

Our financial statements are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(GAAP), which are periodically revised
and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards
Board. Recently, accounting standard setters issued new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to revenue recognition and lease accounting as well as to
issue new standards expanding disclosures. The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports on
Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. An assessment of proposed standards is not provided, as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and, therefore,
their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed. It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that
we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on the reported results of operations and financial position.

ITEM 3.    Legal Proceedings

We are subject to numerous lawsuits and claims arising out of the ordinary course of our business, including actions related to product
liability; personal injury; the use and performance of our products; warranty matters; patent, trademark or other intellectual property infringement; contractual liability; the conduct of our
business; tax reporting in foreign jurisdictions; distributor termination; workplace safety; and environmental matters. We also have been identified as a potentially responsible party at multiple
waste disposal sites under U.S. federal and related state environmental statutes and regulations and may have joint and several liability for any investigation and remediation costs incurred with
respect to such sites. We have denied liability with respect to many of these lawsuits, claims and proceedings and are vigorously defending such lawsuits, claims and proceedings. We carry various
forms of commercial, property and casualty, product liability and other forms of insurance; however, such insurance may not be applicable or adequate to cover the costs associated with a judgment
against us with respect to these lawsuits, claims and proceedings. We do not believe that these lawsuits are material individually or in the aggregate. While we believe we have also established
adequate accruals for our expected future liability with respect to pending lawsuits, claims and proceedings, where the nature and extent of any such liability can be reasonably estimated based upon
then presently available information, there can be no assurance that the final resolution of any existing or future lawsuits, claims or proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

We
conduct significant business operations in Brazil that are subject to the Brazilian federal, state and local labor, social security, tax and customs laws. While we believe we comply
with such laws, they



are
complex, subject to varying interpretations and we are often engaged in litigation regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances.

These
values reflect the sum of shares held in loan status under our Key Employee Stock Investment Plan. The repurchase program authorized by the Board of
Directors does not limit the number of shares that may be purchased and was excluded from this column.

In
2011 we completed our prior authorization, purchasing the remaining $111 million (1.1 million shares) authorized under this plan. In February 2011, the Board of
Directors authorized the acquisition of an additional $1 billion of our common stock beginning in 2011, and we acquired $518 million, or 5.3 million shares, under the new
authorization in 2011. In 2012 we acquired $256 million, or 2.6 million shares, of our common stock leaving $226 million available for purchase under this authorization at
December 31, 2012. In December 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the acquisition of an additional $1 billion of our common stock upon completion of the 2011 repurchase program.

During
the fourth quarter of 2012, we repurchased 17,338 shares from employees in connection with the Key Employee Stock Investment Plan which allows certain employees, other than
officers, to purchase shares of common stock on an installment basis up to an established credit limit. Loans are issued for initial five-year terms at a fixed interest rate established at
the date of purchase and may be refinanced after its initial five-year period for an additional five-year period. Participants must hold



shares
for a minimum of six months from date of purchase and after shares are sold must wait six months before another share purchase may be made. We hold participants' shares as security for the
loans and would, in effect repurchase shares if the participant defaulted in repayment of the loan. There is no maximum amount of shares that we may purchase under this plan.

after-tax) related to legal matters. For the year ended December 31, 2011, consolidated net income included a $68 million gain ($37 million after-tax)
related to the disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and a $53 million gain ($33 million after-tax) recorded for the disposition of certain assets
and liabilities of our light-duty filtration business, both from the Components segment, and a $38 million gain ($24 million after-tax) related to flood damage recoveries
from the insurance settlement related to a June 2008 flood in Southern Indiana. For the year ended December 31, 2010, consolidated net income included $32 million in Brazil tax
recoveries ($21 million after-tax) and $2 million in flood damage expenses. In 2010 it was determined that we overpaid a Brazilian revenue based tax during the period of
2004-2008. Consolidated net income includes a pre-tax recovery related to tax credits on imported products arising from this overpayment. For the year ended December 31,
2009, consolidated net income included $99 million in restructuring and other charges ($65 million after-tax) and a gain of $12 million related to flood damage
recoveries. For the year ended December 31, 2008, consolidated net income included a $37 million restructuring charge ($26 million after-tax), a $36 million
decrease in cash surrender value in corporate owned life insurance and $5 million of losses related to flood damages.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

We are a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines and engine-related
component products, including filtration, aftertreatment, turbochargers, fuel systems, controls systems, air handling systems and electric power generation systems. We sell our products to original
equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and other customers worldwide. We have long-standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve, including
PACCAR Inc, Daimler Trucks North America, Chrysler Group, LLC, Volvo AB, Komatsu, Navistar International Corporation, Aggreko plc, Ford Motor Company and MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG. We serve
our customers through a network of approximately 600 company-owned and independent distributor locations and approximately 6,500 dealer locations in more than 190 countries and territories.

Our
reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Components, Power Generation and Distribution. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and
markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers
in on-highway and various industrial markets. Our engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well as in various industrial applications, including
construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military equipment. The Components segment sells filtration products, aftertreatment, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Power
Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines, generator sets and alternators. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships
engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMs throughout
the world.

Our
financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve, particularly the on-highway, construction and general industrial markets.
Demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions. Our sales may also be impacted by OEM inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages. Economic downturns
in markets we serve



generally
result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products. As a worldwide business, our operations are also affected by currency, political, economic and regulatory matters, including
adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards, in the countries we serve. As part of our growth strategy, we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry high levels of
these risks such as
China, Brazil, India, Mexico, Russia and countries in the Middle East and Africa. At the same time, our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a
drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results.

The
global economy continued to slow throughout 2012, although the impacts were partially offset by strong demand across several end markets in the U.S. and Canada (North America) in the
first half of the year; however these markets weakened in the second half of the year, particularly the heavy-duty truck market. Economies in emerging markets, including China and Brazil
experienced challenges throughout the year in most markets, especially the off-highway construction market in China and the medium-duty truck market in Brazil. Demand in India
remained strong for power generation equipment; however, improved volumes were more than offset by unfavorable currency impacts. International (excludes the U.S. and Canada) off-highway
construction markets have continued to deteriorate with engine shipments down 53 percent, including a 72 percent decline in China. The on-highway medium-duty
truck market in Brazil declined as the result of the 2011 pre-buy ahead of the new 2012 emission requirements and one of our customers replacing our B6.7 engine with a proprietary engine
in 2012 contributing to international medium-duty truck shipments being down 19 percent. North American demand for heavy-duty on-highway products increased
3 percent while medium-duty truck shipments increased 15 percent in 2012 compared to 2011; although demand in both of these markets declined in the second half of 2012. North
American light-duty on-highway demand also improved with an increase in shipments to Chrysler of 37 percent in 2012 compared to 2011.

Slow
growth in the U.S. economy and uncertainty driven by unresolved federal tax and budget issues caused businesses to hold back on capital expenditures in 2012, thus impacting demand
for truck and power generation equipment. The governments of China and India have controlled inflation through tight monetary policies in the form of rising interest rates and tightening access to
credit, although both countries began easing these policies in response to reduced inflationary concerns in 2012. Brazil also began easing their monetary policies in the second half of 2012. Easing
monetary policies could enhance our end markets; however, there likely will be a delay between when these policies are implemented and when our end markets respond. The European economy remains
uncertain with continued volatility in the Euro countries. Although we do not have any significant direct exposure to European sovereign debt, we generated approximately 8 percent of our net
sales from Euro zone countries in 2012. As a result of a number of markets unexpectedly slowing in mid-2012, continued weak economic data in a number of regions and increasing levels of
uncertainty regarding the direction of the global economy, we implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives in the second half of 2012. In October 2012, we announced strategic actions necessary
to respond to the current environment by cutting costs while maintaining investments in key growth programs. Actions include a number of measures to reduce costs including planned work week
reductions, shutdowns at some manufacturing facilities and some targeted workforce reductions. We reduced our workforce by 1,300 people in the fourth quarter and incurred total restructuring charges
of $52 million ($35 million after-tax), or $0.18 per diluted share.

Net
income attributable to Cummins Inc. for 2012 was $1,645 million, or $8.67 per diluted share, on sales of $17.3 billion, compared to 2011 net income attributable
to Cummins Inc. of $1,848 million, or $9.55 per diluted share, on sales of $18.0 billion. The decrease in income and earnings per share was driven by higher operating expenses,
lower gross margins and lower equity, royalty and interest income from investees, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate of 23.5 percent versus 27.1 percent in 2011. In addition,
the significant gains we recorded in 2011 for the disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and light-duty filtration business and flood damage recoveries did
not repeat in 2012. Diluted earnings per share for 2012 benefited $0.06 from lower shares primarily due to the stock repurchase program.

In
July 2012, we completed the acquisition of Hilite Germany GmbH (Hilite) in a cash transaction for $176 million. We also acquired an additional 45 percent interest
in Cummins Central Power for consideration of approximately $20 million.

We
generated $1.5 billion of operating cash flows in 2012, compared to $2.1 billion in 2011. Refer to the section titled "Operating Activities" in the "Liquidity and
Capital Resources" section for a discussion of items impacting cash flows.

In
February 2011, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program and authorized the acquisition of up to $1 billion of our common stock. We repurchased
$256 million of common stock in 2012. In December 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the acquisition of up to $1 billion of our common stock upon completion of the 2011 repurchase
program.

In
July 2012, the Board of Directors authorized a dividend increase of 25 percent from $0.40 to $0.50 per share on a quarterly basis effective in the third quarter. Our debt to
capital ratio (capital is defined as debt plus equity) at December 31, 2012, was 10.0 percent, compared to 11.8 percent at December 31, 2011. As of the date of filing of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we had an 'A' credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor's Rating Services, an 'A' credit rating and a stable outlook from
Fitch Ratings and a 'Baa1' credit rating with a positive outlook from Moody's Investors Service, Inc. In addition to our $1.6 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand, we have
sufficient access to our credit facilities, if necessary, to meet currently anticipated investment and funding needs.



On
November 9, 2012, we entered into a five-year revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders. The credit agreement provides us with a $1.75 billion
senior unsecured revolving credit facility, the proceeds of which are to be used by us for working capital or other general corporate purposes.

Our
global pension plans, including our unfunded non-qualified plans, were 98 percent funded at year-end 2012. Our U.S. qualified plan, which represents
approximately 60 percent of our worldwide pension obligation, was 106 percent funded and our United Kingdom (U.K.) plan was 104 percent funded. Asset returns in 2012 for the U.S.
qualified plan were 14 percent while the year-end 2012 discount rate was 3.95 percent, down 0.85 percentage points from the 2011 discount rate of 4.80 percent.
We expect to contribute $170 million of cash to our global pension plans in 2013. We do not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for our U.S. plans in 2013. We expect pension
and other postretirement benefit expense in 2013 to increase by approximately $35 million pre-tax, or $0.14 per diluted share, when compared to 2012. Refer to application of
critical accounting estimates within MD&A and Note 12, "PENSION AND OTHER POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS," to the

Consolidated Financial Statements

,
for additional information concerning our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.

2013 OUTLOOK

Near-Term

The global economy continued to slow throughout 2012, although the impacts were partially offset by strong demand across several end
markets in North America in the first half of the year; however these markets weakened in the second half of the year, particularly the heavy-duty truck market. Economies in emerging
markets, including China and Brazil experienced challenges throughout the year in most markets, especially the off-highway construction market in China and the medium-duty
truck market in Brazil. Demand in India remained strong for power generation equipment; however, improved volumes were more than offset by unfavorable currency impacts.

We
currently expect the following positive trends in 2013:

•

The Brazilian economy is expected to experience stronger growth in 2013 which is anticipated to result in improving demand
in both truck and industrial markets over 2012 levels.

•

Demand in some of our markets is expected to improve in the second half of 2013 following a slower start in the first half
of the year.

•

The new heavy-duty supply agreement with Navistar International Corporation is expected to have a positive
impact on our heavy-duty truck engine and component sales.

We
currently expect the following challenges to our business that may reduce our earnings potential in 2013:

•

Political decisions in the U.S. regarding federal tax and budget issues could continue to create economic uncertainty that
may limit capital investments and negatively impact the overall North American economy in the first half of 2013.

•

We expect most of our markets to be weak in the first quarter of 2013 but should begin to improve in the second quarter,
although remaining below 2012 levels in the first half of 2013.

•

Demand in certain European markets could continue to decline due to economic uncertainty.

•

Growth in international markets could be negatively impacted if emission regulations are not strictly enforced.

•

Demand for our products in certain industrial markets in China could remain low due to high equipment inventory levels.



•

Currency volatility could continue to put pressure on earnings.

•

North American oil and gas markets could continue to remain weak.

•

Domestic and international mining markets could continue to deteriorate if commodity prices weaken.

Long-Term

We believe that, over the longer term, there will be economic improvements in most of our current markets and that our opportunities
for long-term profitable growth will continue in the future as the result of the following four macroeconomic trends that will benefit our
businesses:

•

tightening emissions controls across the world;

•

infrastructure needs in emerging markets;

•

energy availability and cost issues and

•

globalization of industries like ours.

Net Sales

Net sales decreased versus 2011 and was primarily driven by the following:

•

Engine segment sales decreased by 5 percent due to weakness in industrial demand, especially in international
construction markets, and lower volumes in the Brazilian medium-duty truck market, which were partially offset by growth in the North American on-highway markets in the first
half of the year, led by the heavy-duty business.

•

Foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales by 2 percent.

•

Power Generation segment sales decreased by 7 percent due to lower demand in the generator technologies, power
solutions and power systems businesses, which were partially offset by growing demand in the power product business, especially in North America.

•

Components segment sales, excluding acquisitions, decreased by 2 percent due to $126 million of sales in
2011 related to assets sold in 2011 and lower demand in the turbo technologies, filtration and fuel systems businesses, which were partially offset by higher demand in the emission solutions business,
primarily in North America and Brazil.

The
decreases above were partially offset as Distribution segment sales, excluding acquisitions, increased by 2 percent due to higher demand for parts and filtration products
especially in North and Central America, increased power generation growth in East Asia, increased demand in the South Pacific and higher service demand from South Pacific mining customers, which were
partially offset by lower engine product sales due to a slowdown in the North American oil and gas markets.

A
more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section.

Sales
to international markets were 49 percent of total net sales in 2012, compared with 56 percent of total net sales in 2011.

Gross Margin

Gross margin decreased by $81 million and as a percentage of sales increased by 0.6 percentage points. The increase in
gross margin as a percentage of sales was primarily due to lower material costs, improved price realization, lower warranty costs and favorable product mix, which were partially offset by lower
volumes, unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations and restructuring charges of $29 million.

The
provision for warranties issued as a percentage of sales was 2.1 percent in both 2012 and 2011. A more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the "OPERATING
SEGMENT RESULTS" section.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher consulting of $45 million, restructuring and
other charges of $20 million and an increase of $19 million in compensation and related expenses, which were partially offset by reduced discretionary spending in the



second
half of the year. Higher compensation expense was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives launched prior to a number of markets unexpectedly slowing in
mid-2012. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. Variable compensation related to 2012 performance decreased $87 million over
variable compensation related to 2011 performance. In the third quarter of 2012, we implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives to align our cost structure with the slowdown in demand at
several of our key markets in the second half of the year. Overall, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 11.0 percent in 2012 from
10.2 percent in 2011.

Research, Development and Engineering Expenses

Research, development and engineering expenses increased primarily due to an increase of $54 million in compensation and related
expenses and increased consulting of $32 million. Higher compensation expense was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives. Compensation and related
expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. Variable compensation related to 2012 performance decreased $25 million over variable compensation related to 2011
performance. Research, development and engineering expenses in 2012 also included restructuring and other charges of $3 million. Overall, research, development and engineering expenses, as a
percentage of sales, increased to 4.2 percent in 2012 from 3.5 percent in 2011. Research activities continue to focus on development of new products to meet future emission standards
around the world and improvements in fuel economy performance.

Equity, Royalty and Interest Income From Investees

Equity, royalty and interest income from investees decreased primarily due to the following:

Gain on Sale of Businesses

In the second quarter of 2011, we sold certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business which manufactures exhaust products and
select components for emission systems for a variety of applications not core to our other product offerings. This business was historically included in our Components segment. The sales price was
$123 million. We recognized a gain on the sale of $68 million ($37 million after-tax), which included a goodwill allocation of $19 million. The
gain was excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Sales
for this business were $62 million and $171 million in 2011 (through closing) and 2010, respectively. Income before income taxes for this business were approximately
$9 million and $22 million in 2011 (through closing) and 2010, respectively.



During the fourth quarter of 2011, we sold certain assets and liabilities of our light-duty filtration business which manufactures
light-duty automotive and industrial filtration solutions. The sales price was $90 million and included a note receivable from the buyer of approximately $1 million. There
are no earnouts or other contingencies associated with the sales price. We recognized a gain on the sale of $53 million ($33 million after-tax), which included a goodwill
allocation of $6 million. The gain was excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Sales
for this business were $64 million and $74 million in 2011 (through closing) and 2010, respectively. Income before income taxes for this business were approximately
$13 million and $9 million in 2011 (through closing) and 2010, respectively.

In
the second quarter of 2012, we recorded an additional $6 million gain ($4 million after-tax) related to final purchase price adjustments for our 2011
divestitures. The gain was excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2012.

Income Tax Expense

Our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on
foreign earnings and research tax credits. Our effective tax rate for 2012 was 23.5 percent compared to 27.1 percent for 2011. Our 2012 income tax provision includes a
one-time $134 million tax benefit resulting from transactions entered into and tax return elections made with respect to our U.K. operations. Our 2011 income tax provision includes
a tax benefit of $48 million related to prior year refund claims filed for additional research tax credits, as well as additional foreign income and related foreign tax credits, net of related
tax reserves. Our effective tax rate for 2011 also includes a tax benefit of $19 million related to the release of deferred U.S. tax liabilities on certain foreign earnings, as a result of
restructuring our foreign operations. Also included in 2011 is a tax benefit of $16 million resulting from the reduction of our unrecognized tax benefits primarily due to settlements with
taxing authorities. The 2011 income tax provision also includes other tax items totaling to a $2 million net tax charge, primarily relating to the enactment of state law changes in Indiana and
changes in the U.K. as well as adjustments to our income tax accounts based on our 2010 tax return filings.

On
January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was enacted. This legislation retroactively extended the U.S. federal research credit for two years, from
January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2013. We expect our 2013 effective tax rate, which will include an estimated 1 percent benefit for the 2013 research credit, to be
26 percent excluding any one-time items that may arise. Additionally, we anticipate that our first quarter 2013 results will include a one-time tax benefit of
approximately $28 million representing the net benefit attributable to the 2012 research credit. Earnings of our China operations generated after December 31, 2011, are considered to be
permanently reinvested and additional U.S. deferred tax is no longer being provided on these earnings generated after 2011. We have $702 million of retained earnings and related cumulative
translation adjustments in our China operations generated prior to December 31, 2011 and have provided a U.S. deferred tax liability of $158 million relating to these earnings and
related translation adjustments. We anticipate that these earnings will be distributed to the U.S. within the next five years.



Noncontrolling Interests

Noncontrolling interests eliminate the income or loss attributable to non-Cummins ownership interests in our consolidated
entities. Noncontrolling interests
in income of consolidated subsidiaries decreased primarily due to a decline of $5 million at Wuxi Cummins Turbo Technologies Co. Ltd., $3 million at Cummins Western
Canada LP. and $3 million at Power Systems India. The decreases were partially offset by an increase of $6 million at Cummins Power Solutions Ltd. and $2 million at
Cummins Central Power LLC.

Net Income Attributable to Cummins Inc. and Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to Cummins Inc.

Net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to Cummins Inc. decreased primarily due to lower volumes, particularly in
the international construction and medium-duty truck markets, higher research, development and engineering expenses, higher selling, general and administrative expenses and lower equity,
royalty and interest income from investees. These decreases were partially offset by improved gross margin as a percentage of sales and a lower effective tax rate of 23.5 percent versus
27.1 percent in 2011. In addition, the significant gains we recorded in 2011 for the disposition of certain asset and liabilities of our exhaust business and light-duty filtration
business and flood damage recoveries from the insurance settlement regarding a June 2008 flood in Southern Indiana did not repeat in 2012. Diluted earnings per share for 2012 also benefited $0.06 from
lower shares primarily due to the stock repurchase program.

2011 vs. 2010

Net Sales

Sales increased in all segments primarily due to increased demand from most markets including recovery of the North American
on-highway markets. The primary drivers for the increase in sales were:

•

Engine segment sales increased by 43 percent due to increased demand in all lines of business led by
heavy-duty truck, industrial and medium-duty truck and bus businesses.

•

Components segment sales increased by 33 percent due to increased demand in all lines of business led by emission
solutions and turbo technologies businesses.

•

Power Generation segment sales increased by 20 percent due to increased demand in all lines of business led by
commercial products and generator technologies businesses and improved price realization.

•

Distribution segment sales increased by 31 percent due to increased demand in all product lines and all geographic
regions led by Asia Pacific, North and Central America, Europe and Middle East regions.

A
more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section.

Sales
to international markets were 56 percent of total net sales in 2011, compared with 60 percent of total net sales in 2010.

Gross Margin

Gross margin increased by $1,421 million and as a percentage of sales increased by 1.4 percentage points. The significant
improvement was led by increases in volume, improved price realization, higher product content on certain products and favorable currency impacts, partially offset by higher material costs, higher
commodity costs and higher base warranty costs due to increased volumes and increasing



mix
of EPA 2010 products. Gross margin in 2010 also benefited from a one-time $32 million tax recovery in Brazil. See Note 14, "COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES," in our

Consolidated Financial Statements

for more information.

The
provision for warranties issued as a percentage of sales in 2011 was 2.1 percent compared to 3.0 percent in 2010. Accrual rates for engines sold this year were
generally lower than the rates charged in prior years as our warranty costs for EPA 2010 products have been lower than expected. A more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the
"OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to an increase of $174 million in compensation and related
expenses including increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives, merit increases and increased discretionary spending. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe
benefits and variable compensation. Variable compensation related to 2011 performance increased $42 million over variable compensation related to 2010 performance. Overall, selling, general and
administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased from 11.2 percent in 2010 to 10.2 percent in 2011.

Research, Development and Engineering Expenses

Research, development and engineering expenses increased primarily due to an increase of $79 million in compensation and related
expenses, an increase in the number of engineering programs with increased costs of $79 million and increased discretionary spending. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe
benefits and variable compensation. Variable compensation related to 2011 performance increased $8 million over variable compensation related to 2010 performance. Overall, research, development
and engineering expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 3.5 percent in 2011 from 3.1 percent in 2010. Research activities continue to focus on development of new products to
meet future emission standards around the world and improvements in fuel economy performance.

Equity, Royalty and Interest Income From Investees

These
overall increases were primarily due to the economic recovery in North America, particularly in the oil and gas markets, and strong demand for power generation and mining products
in China with CCEC, which was partially offset by lower sales at DCEC due to weaker demand in the on-highway truck market.

In
June 2008, four of our sites in Southern Indiana, including our Technical Center, experienced extensive flood damage. In October 2011, we received $40 million from our
insurance carriers to settle all outstanding 2008 flood claims. As a result, we recognized a gain of approximately $38 million ($24 million after-tax), net of any remaining
flood related expenses, in "Other operating income (expense), net" in our

Consolidated Statements of Income

.



Interest Income

Interest income increased primarily due to higher average cash balances in addition to higher average interest rates.

Interest Expense

Interest expense increased primarily due to lower capitalized interest in 2011 and higher average debt, partially offset by lower
interest rates.

Income Tax Expense

Our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on
foreign earnings and research tax credits. Our effective tax rate for 2011 was 27.1 percent compared to 29.5 percent for 2010. Our 2011 income tax provision includes a tax benefit of
$48 million related to prior year refund claims filed for additional research tax credits, as well as additional foreign income and related foreign tax credits, net of related tax reserves. Our
effective tax rate for 2011 also includes a tax benefit of $19 million related to the release of deferred U.S. tax liabilities on certain foreign earnings, as a result of restructuring our
foreign operations. Also included in 2011 is a tax benefit of $16 million resulting from the reduction of our unrecognized tax benefits primarily due to settlements with taxing authorities. The
2011 income tax provision also includes other tax items totaling to a $2 million net tax charge, primarily relating to the enactment of state law changes in Indiana and changes in the U.K. as
well as adjustments to our income tax accounts based on our 2010 tax return filings. Our 2010 income tax provision includes a $17 million reduction in the fourth quarter related to the
legislative reinstatement of the U.S. research tax credit as well as a $3 million tax benefit related to the release of deferred U.S. tax liabilities on foreign earnings now considered to be
permanently reinvested outside of the U.S.

Noncontrolling Interests

Noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries decreased primarily due to a decline of $9 million at Wuxi
Cummins Turbo Technologies Co. Ltd. and $4 million at Cummins India Ltd., a publicly traded company on various exchanges in India. These decreases were partially offset by
an increase of $6 million at Cummins Western Canada LP, $4 million at Cummins Power Systems LLC and $1 million at Cummins Northeast LLC.



Net Income Attributable to Cummins Inc. and Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to Cummins Inc.

Net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to Cummins Inc. increased primarily due to higher volumes in most markets
and geographic regions, including the recovery of the North American on-highway truck markets, significantly improved gross margins, the gain on disposition of certain assets and
liabilities of our exhaust business and our light-duty filtration business, a lower effective tax rate, increased equity income and the gain related to flood damage recoveries from the
insurance settlement regarding a June 2008 flood in Southern Indiana. These favorable drivers were partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and
engineering expenses in 2011 as compared to 2010. Diluted earnings per share for 2011 also benefited $0.17 from lower shares primarily due to the stock repurchase program.

RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES

We have executed restructuring actions primarily in the form of involuntary separation programs in the fourth quarter of 2012. These
actions were in response to deterioration in our U.S. businesses and most key markets around the world in the second half of 2012, as well as a reduction in orders in most U.S. and global markets for
2013. We reduced our worldwide professional workforce by approximately 650 employees, or 3 percent. We also reduced our hourly
workforce by approximately 650 employees. During 2012, we incurred a pre-tax charge related to the professional and hourly workforce reductions of approximately $49 million.

Employee
termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated, benefits
to be paid under existing severance plans or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan. Estimates of restructuring were made based on information available at the
time charges were recorded. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved, actual amounts paid for such activities may differ from amounts initially recorded and we may need to revise previous estimates.

We
incurred a $1 million charge for lease terminations and a $2 million charge for asset impairments and other non-cash charges. During 2012, we recorded
restructuring and other charges of $52 million ($35 million after-tax). These restructuring actions included:

If
the 2012 restructuring actions are successfully implemented, we expect the annualized savings from the professional actions to be approximately $39 million. Our charge related
to the professional actions was approximately $32 million. Approximately 32 percent of the savings from the restructuring actions will be realized in cost of sales, 53 percent in
selling, general and administrative expenses and 15 percent in research, development and engineering expenses. We expect the accrual to be paid in cash which will be funded with cash generated
from operations.

At
December 31, 2012, of the approximately 1,300 employees to be affected by this plan, 1,130 had been terminated.

OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS

Our reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Components, Power Generation and Distribution. This reporting
structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine
segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various industrial markets. Our engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well
as in various industrial applications, including construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military equipment. The Components segment sells filtration products, aftertreatment,
turbochargers and fuel systems. The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines, generator sets and alternators. The Distribution segment includes
wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining
relationships with various OEMs throughout the world.

We
use segment EBIT (defined as earnings before interest expense, taxes and noncontrolling interests) as a primary basis for the chief operating decision-maker to evaluate the
performance of each of our operating segments. Segment amounts exclude certain expenses not specifically identifiable to segments.



The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those applied in our

Consolidated Financial
Statements

. We prepared the financial results of our operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information
to assist in making internal operating decisions. We have allocated certain common costs and expenses, primarily corporate functions, among segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial
information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). These include certain costs and expenses of shared services, such as
information technology, human resources, legal and finance. We also do not allocate debt-related items, actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, changes in cash surrender
value of corporate owned life insurance, flood damage gains or losses, divestiture gains or losses or income taxes to individual segments. In 2012, non-segment items included a
$20 million reserve ($12 million after-tax) related to legal matters and a $6 million gain related to adjustments from our 2011 divestitures, while 2011 included the gain on
disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and our light-duty filtration business and 2010 included a Brazil revenue tax recovery. These gains were not allocated
to the businesses as they were not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year. Segment EBIT may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.

Following
is a discussion of operating results for each of our business segments.

2012 vs. 2011

Sales

Engine segment sales decreased versus 2011 due to lower demand in the industrial and medium-duty truck and bus businesses, partially
offset by growth in the
heavy-duty truck and light-duty automotive and RV businesses. The following are the primary drivers by market:

•

Industrial market sales decreased primarily due to a 53 percent decline in construction engine shipments in
international markets, including a 72 percent decline in China, and a 44 percent decline in engine shipments to the North American oil and gas markets due to weakened natural gas prices,
which were partially offset by a 4 percent increase in engine shipments in the North American construction market.

•

Medium-duty truck and bus sales decreased primarily due to lower demand in the Brazilian truck market due to
pre-buy activity in the second half of 2011 ahead of the implementation of Euro V emission regulations in the first quarter of 2012 and one of our customers replacing our B6.7 engine with
a proprietary engine in 2012. The B6.7 engine replacement was partially offset by the 2012 launch of our ISF and 9 liter engines in new light-duty on-highway and
medium-duty truck applications, respectively, with this same customer. The decrease was further offset by improved demand in North American markets.

The
decreases above were partially offset by the following:

•

Heavy-duty truck engine sales increased due to growth in the North American on-highway markets in
the first half of the year, primarily as a result of the replacement of aging fleets.

•

Light-duty automotive and RV sales increased primarily due to a 37 percent improvement in units shipped
to Chrysler.



Total
on-highway-related sales for 2012 were 59 percent of total engine segment sales, compared to 56 percent in 2011.

Segment EBIT

Engine segment EBIT decreased versus 2011, primarily due to lower gross margin, lower equity, royalty and interest income from
investees, higher research, development and engineering expenses and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. Engine segment EBIT for 2012 included restructuring and other charges of
$20 million in the fourth quarter. Changes in Engine segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows:

The
decrease in gross margin versus 2011 was primarily due to lower volumes and restructuring and other charges, which was partially offset by improved price realization, lower material
costs, favorable product mix and improved product coverage. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth
initiatives launched prior to a number of markets unexpectedly slowing in mid-2012, partially offset by decreased variable compensation expense. The increase in research, development and
engineering expenses was primarily due to new product development spending and increased headcount to support
our strategic growth initiatives. The decrease in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was primarily due to weaker demand for on-highway products at DCEC.

2011 vs. 2010

Sales

Engine segment sales increased in all businesses versus 2010, as demand improved in most markets including a significant rebound in
North American on-highway markets, improvements in international construction markets, increased demand in global mining markets and significant increases in oil and gas markets. The
following are the primary drivers by market:

•

Heavy-duty truck engine sales increased due to recovery in North American on-highway markets as
OEM customers replaced their aging fleets and the depletion of transition engine inventory purchased in 2009 in advance of the EPA's 2010 emission standard changes.

•

Industrial market sales increased primarily due to a 26 percent improvement in international construction engine
shipments driven by the economic recovery and infrastructure improvements in certain emerging markets, increased demand in advance of off-highway emission regulations in the U.S. and
Europe, a 46 percent increase in units sold in the global mining engine markets due to increased coal and commodity demands and more than double the number of oil and gas engine shipments in
North America.

•

Medium-duty truck and bus sales increased primarily due to the recovery in North American
on-highway markets, the depletion of transition engine inventory purchased in 2009 in advance of the EPA's 2010 emissions change and higher demand in the Brazilian truck engine market
driven by a growing economy.



Total
on-highway-related sales for 2011 were 56 percent of total engine segment sales, compared to 50 percent in 2010.

Segment EBIT

Engine segment EBIT increased significantly versus 2010, primarily due to higher gross margin, partially offset by increased selling,
general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses. Changes in Engine segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows:

The
increase in gross margin versus 2010 was primarily due to higher volumes, improved price realization and favorable mix, partially offset by higher commodity costs and higher base
warranty costs due to increased volumes and increasing mix of EPA 2010 products. Although our warranty costs increased, our warranty cost as a percentage of sales decreased as actual accrual rates for
engines sold this year were generally lower than rates charged in prior years as our warranty costs for EPA 2010 engines have been lower than expected. The increases in selling, general and
administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses were primarily due to new product development spending and increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives.
The increase in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was primarily due to strong demand for power generation and mining products in China with CCEC and strong export sales to Russia and
Brazil in the midrange
on-highway market with Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd., which was partially offset by lower sales at DCEC due to weaker demand in the on-highway
heavy-duty and medium-duty truck market in China.

Acquisition

In April 2012, we reached an agreement to acquire the doser technology and business assets from Hilite in a cash transaction. Dosers
are products that enable compliance with emission standards in certain aftertreatment systems and complement our current product offerings. The transaction was approved by German regulators in June
and closed on July 18, 2012. The purchase price was $176 million. There was no contingent consideration associated with this transaction. During 2012 we expensed approximately $4 million
of acquisition related costs. See Note 2, "ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES," to the

Consolidated Financial Statements

for more details.

2012 vs. 2011

Sales

Components segment sales, excluding the acquisition, decreased versus 2011. The following are the primary
drivers:

•

Turbo technologies business sales decreased primarily due to a decline in OEM sales in Europe and China, reduced
aftermarket demand and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, which were partially offset by higher OEM demand in North America in the first half of the year.

•

Foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales results.



•

Filtration business sales decreased primarily as a result of the disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our
light-duty filtration business and our exhaust business in 2011 and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations. Disposition related sales were $71 million in 2011. The decreases were
partially offset by increased aftermarket demand in the first half of the year.

•

Fuel systems business sales decreased primarily due to lower European demand and reduced aftermarket demand, which were
partially offset by improved demand in North American on-highway markets in the first half of the year.

The
decreases above were partially offset by the emission solutions business as sales increased primarily due to higher demand in the North American on-highway market in the
first half of the year and new sales in the Brazilian on-highway market as the result of new emission requirements effective January 1, 2012, partially offset by lower sales due to
the disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business in the second quarter of 2011, lower price realization and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations. Disposition related
sales were $55 million in 2011.

Segment EBIT

Components segment EBIT decreased versus 2011, primarily due to higher research, development and engineering expenses. Components
segment EBIT for 2012 included restructuring and other charges of $6 million in the fourth quarter. Changes in Components segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows:

Segment EBIT Excluding Acquisition

The decrease in gross margin versus 2011 was primarily due to lower price realization, unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, the
disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and our light-duty filtration business in 2011 and restructuring and other charges, partially offset by higher
volumes, particularly in the emission solutions business, lower material costs and improved product coverage. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to
increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives launched prior to a number of markets unexpectedly slowing in mid-2012, partially offset by decreased variable compensation
expense and lower discretionary spending in the second half of 2012. The increase in research, development and engineering expenses was primarily due to new product development spending and increased
headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives.



2011 vs. 2010

Sales

Components segment sales increased in all businesses versus 2010. The following are the primary regional drivers by
business:

•

Emission solutions business sales increased due to the increased sales volume of North American EPA 2010 aftertreatment
systems and increased demand for Euro V aftertreatment systems in Europe, which were partially offset by lower sales due to the sale of the exhaust business.

•

Turbo technologies business sales increased due to higher OEM demand in North America, Europe, India and Brazil and
improved aftermarket demand.

•

Fuel systems business sales increased primarily due to improved demand in North American on-highway markets.

•

Filtration business sales increased due to improved aftermarket demand, especially in Asia Pacific and Europe, higher OEM
demand due to the recovery in North American on-highway markets and favorable foreign currency impacts which were partially offset by lower sales due to the disposition of certain assets
and liabilities of our exhaust and light-duty filtration businesses.

Segment EBIT

Components segment EBIT increased versus 2010, primarily due to the improved gross margin which was partially offset by increased
research, development and engineering expenses and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in Components segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows:

—

The
increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher volumes for all businesses and increased product content on 2010 North American truck engines. The increases in research,
development and engineering expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses were primarily due to new product development spending and increased headcount to support our strategic growth
initiatives. The increase in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was driven by improved joint venture income from both the filtration business in China and India and the fuel systems
business.

In
2011, we sold certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and light-duty filtration business and recognized $68 million and $53 million,
respectively, in pre-tax gain on the sales. The gains have been excluded from Components results as they were not considered in our evaluation of Components operating results for the year
ended 2011. See Note 2, "ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES," to the

Consolidated Financial Statements.

2012 vs. 2011

Sales

Power Generation segment sales decreased versus 2011, primarily due to lower demand in the generator technologies, power solutions and
power systems businesses. The following are the primary drivers by business:

•

Generator technologies sales decreased primarily due to demand reductions in Europe and Asia and unfavorable foreign
currency fluctuations.

•

Power solutions sales decreased primarily due to lower volumes in Europe, Africa, Russia and Asia.

•

Power systems sales decreased primarily due to lower volumes in the Middle East, North America and Latin America and
unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, which were partially offset by stronger demand in Asia and improved price realization.

The
decreases above were partially offset by power products as sales increased primarily due to higher volumes in North America and Western Europe and improved price realization. These
increases were partially offset by demand reductions in China, the U.K., Latin America and Eastern Europe and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations.

Segment EBIT

Power Generation segment EBIT decreased versus 2011, primarily due to lower gross margin, higher research, development and engineering
expenses, lower equity, royalty and interest income from investees and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. Power Generation segment EBIT for 2012 included restructuring and other
charges of $12 million in the fourth quarter. Changes in Power Generation segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows:

The
decrease in gross margin versus 2011 was due to lower volumes, unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, higher material costs, increased product coverage and restructuring and
other charges,



which
were partially offset by improved price realization. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth
initiatives, partially offset by lower discretionary spending in the second half of 2012 to align with slowing demand in key markets. The increase in research, development and engineering expenses was
primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives and new product development spending. Equity, royalty and interest income from investees decreased primarily due to
lower profitability at Cummins Olayan and CCEC.

2011 vs. 2010

Sales

Power Generation segment sales increased in all businesses, versus 2010, primarily due to increased demand in the power systems, power
products and generator technologies businesses. The following are the primary drivers by business:

•

Power systems sales increased due to stronger demand in North America, the Middle East, China and Latin American markets
and improved price realization.

•

Power products sales increased due to stronger demand in most regions, particularly in Asia, North America, the Middle
East and Latin America, improved price realization, new product introductions and favorable foreign currency impacts.

•

Generator technologies sales increased due to improved price realization, stronger demand in most regions, especially
Western Europe, Asia and the U.K., and favorable foreign currency impacts.

•

Power solutions sales increased due to our largest customer expanding its gas genset rental fleet and overall general
market growth in the power solutions business mainly in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

Segment EBIT

Power Generation segment EBIT increased versus 2010, primarily due to higher gross margins, partially offset by higher selling, general
and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses. Changes in Power Generation segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows:

2012 vs. 2011

Sales

Distribution segment sales, excluding the acquisitions, increased versus 2011 due to higher demand in the parts and filtration, power
generation and service businesses, partially offset by lower demand in the engine business. The following were the primary drivers by line of
business:

•

Parts and filtration product sales increased primarily due to higher demand in North and Central America and the Middle
East.

•

Power generation product sales increased primarily due to growth in East Asia and improved demand in the South Pacific,
which were partially offset by a reduction in nonrecurring project-related sales in the Middle East.

•

Service revenue increased primarily due to higher demand from mining customers in the South Pacific and higher volumes in
East Asia and Europe.

The
increases above were partially offset by the following:

•

Foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales results.

•

Engine product sales decreased primarily due to a significant slowdown in the North American oil and gas markets and lower
demand in Europe as a result of pre-buy activity in the second half of 2011 ahead of the 2012 emissions change for certain construction engines, which were partially offset by growth in
East Asia.

Segment EBIT

Distribution segment EBIT decreased versus 2011, primarily due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses and higher
research, development and engineering expenses, which were partially offset by higher equity, royalty and interest income from investees and higher gross margin. Distribution segment EBIT for 2012
included restructuring and other charges of $14 million in the fourth quarter. Changes in Distribution segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows:

Segment EBIT Excluding Acquisitions

The decrease in gross margin versus 2011 was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts, unfavorable variations in
geographic mix and restructuring and other charges, which were partially offset by higher volumes in most products. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to
increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives launched



prior
to a number of markets unexpectedly slowing in mid-2012, partially offset by decreased variable compensation expense and lower discretionary spending in the second half of 2012. The
increase in research, development and engineering expenses was mainly due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives. The increase in equity, royalty and interest income from
investees was primarily due to increased income from North American distributors.

2011 vs. 2010

Sales

Distribution segment sales increased for all product lines versus 2010. The following were the primary drivers by line of
business:

•

Engine product sales increased primarily due to growth in the oil and gas markets in North and Central America, improved
demand in certain markets in Europe, partially driven by pre-buy activity ahead of the 2012 emissions change and higher demand in Africa.

•

Power generation product sales increased primarily due to improved project-based business across North and Central
America, South Pacific, Middle East and Europe, increased demand from Japan's earthquake recovery and the acquisition of a previously independent distributor in 2010.

•

Parts and filtration product sales increased primarily due to higher demand in North and Central America, the acquisition
of a previously independent distributor in 2010, higher demand from mining customers in the South Pacific, improved sales in East Asia as the result of overall market recovery and increasing engine
populations and higher demand driven by economic recovery in Europe.

•

Foreign currency fluctuations also favorably impacted sales.

Segment EBIT

Distribution segment EBIT increased versus 2010, primarily due to improved gross margin and equity, royalty and interest income from
investees, which was partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment EBIT was also unfavorably impacted by the absence of a one-time gain of
$12 million from the acquisition of Cummins Western Canada in 2010. Changes in Distribution segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows:

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Management's Assessment of Liquidity

Our financial condition and liquidity remain strong. Our solid balance sheet and credit ratings enable us to have ready access to
credit.

We
assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. We generate significant ongoing cash flow, which has
been used, in part, to fund capital expenditures, pay dividends on our common stock, fund repurchases of common stock and make acquisitions. Cash provided by operations is our principal source of
liquidity. As of December 31, 2012, other sources of liquidity included:

•

cash and cash equivalents of $1.4 billion, of which approximately 24 percent was located in the U.S. and
76 percent was located primarily in the U.K., China, Singapore, India and Brazil,

•

marketable securities of $247 million, which were located primarily in India and Brazil and the majority of which
could be liquidated into cash within a few days,

•

revolving credit facility with $1.7 billion available, net of outstanding letters of credit and

•

international and other domestic short-term credit facilities with $301 million available.

We
believe our liquidity provides us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital, capital expenditures, projected pension obligations, dividend payments, common stock
repurchases, acquisitions, restructuring actions and debt service obligations.



Our
new revolving credit agreement, completed in the fourth quarter of 2012, provides us with a $1.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, the proceeds of which are to be
used for our general corporate purposes. See Note 10, "DEBT" to our

Consolidated Financial Statements

for further information. The credit
agreement includes one financial covenant: a leverage ratio. The required leverage ratio, which measures the sum of total debt plus securitization financing to consolidated earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the four fiscal quarters may not exceed 3.25 to 1.0. At December 31, 2012, our leverage ratio was 0.30 to 1.0.

A
significant portion of our cash flows is generated outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2012, the total of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign
subsidiaries was $1.3 billion, the vast majority of which was located in the U.K., China, India, Singapore and Brazil. The geographic location of our cash and marketable securities aligns well
with our business growth strategy. We manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness
with which those funds can be accessed. As a result, we do not anticipate any local liquidity restrictions to preclude us from funding our targeted expansion or operating needs with local resources.

If
we distribute our foreign cash balances to the U.S. or to other foreign subsidiaries, we could be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes. For example, we would be required to accrue
and pay additional U.S. taxes if we repatriated cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings we have asserted are permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. Foreign earnings for which we
assert permanent reinvestment outside the U.S. consist primarily of earnings of our U.K. domiciled subsidiaries. At present, we do not foresee a need to repatriate any earnings from these subsidiaries
for which we have asserted permanent reinvestment. However, to help fund cash needs of the U.S. or other international subsidiaries as they arise, we repatriate available cash from certain foreign
subsidiaries whose earnings are not permanently reinvested when it is cost effective to do so. Our 2012 and subsequent earnings from our China operations are considered permanently reinvested, while
earnings generated prior to 2012, for which U.S. deferred tax liabilities have been recorded, are expected to be repatriated in future years.

We
continuously monitor our pension assets and believe that we have limited exposure to the European debt crisis. No sovereign debt instruments of crisis countries are held in the
trusts, while any equities are held with large well-diversified multinational firms or are de minimis amounts in large index funds. Our pension plans have not experienced any significant
impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility in the credit markets.

The
maturity schedule of our existing long-term debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term. Required annual principal payments range from
$13 million to $72 million over each of the next five years.

Working Capital Summary

We fund our working capital with cash from operations and short-term borrowings when necessary. Various assets and
liabilities, including short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month



depending
on short-term liquidity needs. As a result, working capital is a prime focus of management attention.

Current
assets increased 1 percent as increases in other current assets (primarily related to refundable income taxes) and higher inventory levels due to the unexpected decline in
demand were mostly offset by decreased cash and cash equivalents, lower accounts and notes receivable and lower marketable securities.

Current
liabilities decreased 14 percent primarily due to lower accounts payable as a result of reduced purchasing volumes, a decrease in accrued compensation, benefits and
retirement costs due to lower variable compensation expense for 2012 and a decrease in taxes payable caused by lower earnings and higher estimated tax payments in 2012 compared to 2011.

Days'
sales in receivables increased five days compared to 2011. The increase was due to higher average receivable balances throughout 2012 on lower sales due to the decline in volume

2012 vs. 2011

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased versus 2011 primarily due to unfavorable working capital fluctuations and lower
consolidated net income, which were partially offset by a lower non-cash gain on disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and our light-duty
filtration business in 2012. During 2012, the net increase in working capital resulted in a cash outflow of $775 million compared to a cash outflow of $154 million in 2011. This change
of $621 million was primarily driven by lower accrued expenses and a decrease in accounts payable, as volumes dropped in the second half of the year, and higher cash tax payments of
approximately $159 million. These were partially offset by a decrease in accounts and notes receivable and a smaller increase in inventory in 2012.



Pensions

The
funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets, market interest rates and
levels of voluntary contributions to the plans. In 2012, the return for our U.S. plan was 14 percent while our U.K. plan return exceeded 7 percent. Approximately 76 percent of our
pension plan assets are held in highly liquid investments such as equity and fixed income securities. The remaining 24 percent of our plan assets are held in less liquid, but market valued
investments, including real estate, private equity and insurance contracts. We made $132 million of pension contributions in 2012. Claims and premiums for other postretirement benefits
approximated $41 million, net of reimbursements, in 2012. The $132 million of pension contributions in 2012 included voluntary contributions of $110 million. These contributions
and payments include payments from our funds either to increase pension plan assets or to make direct payments to plan participants. We anticipate making total contributions of $170 million to
our defined benefit pension plans in 2013. Expected contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2013 will meet or exceed the current funding requirements.

2011 vs. 2010

Net cash provided by operating activities increased versus 2010 primarily due to significantly higher consolidated net income,
excluding the gain on the sale of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and our light-duty filtration business, as a result of higher sales volumes, higher dividends from
equity investees and favorable working capital fluctuations. During 2011, the net increase in working capital resulted in a cash outflow of $154 million compared to a cash outflow of
$245 million in 2010. This decrease of $91 million was primarily driven by a smaller increase in inventory in 2011 as we significantly increased inventory levels in 2010 to meet
anticipated post-recession demand.

2012 vs. 2011

Net cash used in investing activities increased versus 2011 primarily due to cash investments for the acquisitions of Hilite and
Cummins Central Power, proceeds from the 2011 disposition of certain



assets
and liabilities of our exhaust business and light-duty filtration business, which did not repeat in 2012, and increased capital expenditures.

Capital
expenditures were $690 million in 2012 compared to $622 million in 2011. Despite the challenging economies around the world, we continue to invest in new product
lines and targeted capacity expansions. We plan to spend approximately $850 million in 2013 as we continue with product launches and facility improvements and prepare for future emission
standards. Over one-half of our capital expenditures will be invested outside of the U.S. in 2013.

2011 vs. 2010

Net cash used in investing activities decreased versus 2010 primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of certain assets and
liabilities of our exhaust business and our light-duty filtration business (See Note 2, "ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES" to our

Consolidated Financial
Statements

), decreased acquisitions and increased liquidations of marketable securities, the acquisition of Cummins Western Canada in 2010 and decreased purchases of other
investments. These drivers were partially offset by increased capital expenditures, additional investments in and advances to equity investees and lower proceeds from dispositions of property, plant
and equipment.

2011 vs. 2010

Net cash used in financing activities increased versus 2010, primarily due to significantly higher repurchases of common stock,
increased payments on borrowings and capital lease obligations, decreased proceeds from borrowings and higher dividend payments.



Our
total debt was $783 million as of December 31, 2011, compared with $843 million as of December 31, 2010. Total debt as a percent of our total capital,

dividends in the future depends upon our income and liquidity position, among other factors, and is subject to declaration by our Board of Directors, who meet quarterly to consider our dividend
payment. We expect to fund dividend payments with cash from operations.

Credit Ratings

A number of our contractual obligations and financing agreements, such as our revolving credit facility, have restrictive covenants
and/or pricing modifications that may be triggered in the event of downward revisions to our corporate credit rating. There were no downgrades of our credit ratings in 2012 that have impacted these
covenants or pricing modifications. In September 2011, Standard & Poor's Rating Services upgraded our rating to 'A' and changed our outlook to stable. In November 2011, Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. raised our rating to 'Baa1' and changed our outlook to positive. In October 2012, Fitch Ratings upgraded our ratings to 'A' and changed our outlook to stable.

Credit
ratings are not recommendations to buy, are subject to change and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. In addition, we undertake no obligation to
update disclosures concerning our credit ratings, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Our ratings and outlook from each of the credit rating agencies as of the date of

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 1, "SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES," of our

Consolidated Financial
Statements

which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives.

Our

Consolidated Financial Statements

are prepared in accordance with GAAP which often requires management to make judgments, estimates
and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements. Management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical
experience, changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In any given reporting period, our actual results may differ from the
estimates and assumptions used in preparing our

Consolidated Financial Statements.



Critical
accounting estimates are defined as follows: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made;
different estimates reasonably could have been used; or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial
condition or results of operations. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies, related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with
the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs, recoverability of investment
related to new products, accounting for income taxes and pension benefits.

Warranty Programs

We estimate and record a liability for base warranty programs at the time our products are sold. Our estimates are based on historical
experience and reflect management's best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ. As a result of the
uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs, the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action or when a recall becomes probable and
estimable, which generally occurs when it is announced. Our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates, repair costs and the point of failure within the product life cycle.
Future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability. New product launches require a greater use of judgment in
developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. Product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch, with a clear experience trend evident
eight quarters after launch. We generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a preceding product's warranty history and a multiplicative factor based upon preceding similar
product experience and new product assessment until sufficient new product data is available for warranty estimation. We then use a blend of actual new product experience and preceding product
historical experience for several subsequent quarters, and new product specific experience thereafter. Note 11, "PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY," to our

Consolidated
Financial Statements

contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2012 and 2011 including adjustments to pre-existing warranties.

Recoverability of Investment Related to New Products

At December 31, 2012, we have capitalized $233 million associated with the future launch of our new
light-duty diesel engine product. Development of this product began in 2006. Market uncertainty related to the global recession that began in 2008 resulted in some customers delaying or
cancelling their vehicle programs. At December 31, 2009, we reviewed our investment of $216 million for possible impairment. We used projections to assess whether future cash flows on an
undiscounted basis related to the assets are likely to exceed the related carrying amount to determine if a write-down was appropriate. These projections required estimates about product
volume and the size of the market for vehicles that are not yet developed. We used input from our customers in developing alternative cash flow scenarios. Our analysis indicated that the assets were
recoverable. Customers that are expected to purchase sufficient quantities to recover our investment in the new light-duty diesel engine products remained active with the development of
this product through 2012, and there were no significant changes to the assumptions used in 2009. If customer expectations or projected volumes deteriorate and we do not identify alternative customers
and/or product applications, we could be required to write-down these assets to net realizable value.



Accounting for Income Taxes

We determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future tax benefits
of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future
profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2012, we recorded net deferred tax assets of
$396 million. These assets included $165 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance of $95 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to
the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized. In the event our operating performance deteriorates, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will
be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex
issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax
positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available. A more complete description
of
our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in Note 4, "INCOME TAXES," to our

Consolidated Financial
Statements

.

Pension Benefits

We sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the U.S. and the U.K. and to a lesser degree in various other countries. In the U.S.
and the U.K. we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded. We account for our pension programs in accordance with employers' accounting for defined benefit pension and other
postretirement plans under GAAP. GAAP requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis. As a result, our pension benefit programs are based on a number
of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at December 31. These
assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities, assumed rates of return on plan assets, future compensation increases, employee turnover rates, actuarial assumptions relating to
retirement age, mortality rates and participant withdrawals. The actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions, participant life span
and withdrawal rates. These differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our

Consolidated Financial
Statements

in the future.

The
expected long-term return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension expense. We considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return
on plan assets. The long-term rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a
five-year average market value of return. Projected returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio
and investment management. As of December 31, 2012, based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our U.S. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the
10-year projection period equal to or in excess of 7.5 percent approximately 40 percent of the time while returns of 9.0 percent or greater are anticipated
25 percent of the time. We expect additional positive returns from active investment management. The 2012 one year return was 14 percent, combined with the very favorable returns in 2011
has eliminated the significant deterioration in pension assets experienced in 2008 as a result of the credit crisis and related market recession. Based on the historical returns and forward-looking
return expectations, we believe an investment return assumption of 8.0 percent per year in 2013 for U.S. pension assets is reasonable.



The
methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the U.K. was based on establishing an equity-risk premium over current long-term bond yields
adjusted based on target asset allocations. As of December 31, 2012, based upon our target asset allocations, it is anticipated that our U.K. investment policy will generate an average annual
return over the 20-year projection period equal to or in excess of 5.6 percent approximately 50 percent of the time while returns of 6.5 percent or greater are
anticipated 25 percent of the time. We expect additional positive returns from active investment management. The one year return for our U.K. plan exceeded 7 percent for 2012 and similar
to our U.S. plan, the 2008 market related deterioration in our plan assets has been eliminated. Our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a
long-term outlook. Therefore, the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a long-term horizon. Based on the historical returns and forward-looking return
expectations, we believe an investment return assumption of 5.8 percent in 2013 for U.K. pension assets is reasonable. Our pension plan asset allocation at December 31, 2012 and 2011 and
target allocation for 2013 are as follows:

The
differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected long-term return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense
over five years. The table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension expense for the period 2010-2012 and our expected rate of return for 2013.

A
lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension expense and reduce profitability.

GAAP
for pensions offers various acceptable alternatives to account for the differences that eventually arise between the estimates used in the actuarial valuations and the actual
results. It is acceptable to delay or immediately recognize these differences. Under the delayed recognition alternative, changes in pension obligation (including those resulting from plan amendments)
and changes in the value of assets set aside to meet those obligations are not recognized in net periodic pension cost as they occur but are recognized initially in comprehensive income and
subsequently amortized as components of net periodic pension cost systematically and gradually over future periods. In addition to this approach, GAAP also allows immediate recognition of actuarial
gains or losses. Immediate recognition introduces volatility in financial results. We have chosen to delay recognition and amortize actuarial differences over future periods. If we adopted the
immediate recognition approach, we would record a loss of $1,082 million ($724 million after-tax) for our U.S. and U.K. pension plans.

The
difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and, under certain circumstances such as when
the difference



exceeds
10 percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation (PBO), amortized over future years of service. This is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions.
As of December 31, 2012, we had net pension actuarial losses of $734 million and $349 million for the U.S. and U.K. pension plans, respectively. Under GAAP, the actuarial gains
and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Increases in actuarial losses decreased our shareholders' equity by $83 million (after-tax) in 2012.
The increases were due to liability losses from reduced discount rates, partially offset by improved plan asset performance in 2012. As these amounts exceed 10 percent of our PBO, the excess is
amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees.

The
table below sets forth the net periodic pension expense for the period 2010 through 2012 and our expected expense for 2013.

Net Periodic Pension

Expense

In millions





Pension expense

$


$


$


$


We
expect 2013 pension expense to be increased significantly over 2012, due to the unfavorable impacts of higher service cost due to increased headcount, decreased discount rates and
lower expected asset returns for our U.K. plan as we de-risk plan trust assets moving toward more conservative investments. The decrease in periodic pension expense in 2012 compared to
2011 was due to improved returns on assets and strong contributions in 2011. The decrease in periodic pension expense in 2011 compared to 2010 was due to improved returns on assets as the capital
markets began to recover and strong contributions in 2010. Another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension expense is the discount rate. The weighted average discount rates
used to develop our net periodic pension expense are set forth in the table below.

Changes
in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension expense calculation.

The
discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. The guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in GAAP
which suggests the use of a high-quality corporate bond rate. We used bond information provided by Moody's Investor Service Inc., Standard & Poor's Rating Services, Fitch Ratings
and Dominion Bond Rating. All bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the U.S. and U.K. were high-quality, non-callable bonds (Aa or better) as of
December 31, 2012, by at least two of the bond rating agencies. The average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to
value the obligations of the plans subject to GAAP for pensions and other postretirement benefits.

Our
model called for 80 years of benefit payments for the U.S. plans and 60 years of payments for the U.K. For both countries, our model matches the present value of the
plan's projected benefit payments to the market value of the theoretical settlement bond portfolio. A single equivalent discount rate is determined to align the present value of the required cash flow
with the value of the bond portfolio. The resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plan's distinct liability characteristics.



The
table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2013 net periodic pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan
assets.

The
above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. A higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension expense. A
lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension expense. It should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions
simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear.

RECENTLY ADOPTED AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted

In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended its rules regarding the presentation of comprehensive income. The
objective of this amendment was to improve the comparability, consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income.
Specifically, this amendment requires that all non-owner changes in shareholders' equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but
consecutive statements. In addition, the standard also requires disclosure of the location of reclassification adjustments between other comprehensive income and net income on the face of the
financial statements. The new rules became effective for us beginning January 1, 2012. In December 2011, the FASB deferred certain aspects of this standard beyond the current effective date,
specifically the provisions dealing with reclassification adjustments. Because the standard only impacts the display of comprehensive income and does not impact what is included in comprehensive
income, the standard did not have a significant impact on our

Consolidated Financial Statements

.

In
May 2011, the FASB amended its standards related to fair value measurements and disclosures. The objective of the amendment was to improve the comparability of fair value measurements
presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. Primarily this amendment changed the wording used to
describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in addition to clarifying the Board's intent about the
application of existing fair value measurement requirements. The new standard also requires additional disclosures related to fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair
value hierarchy and requires disclosure of the categorization in the hierarchy for items which are not recorded at fair value but fair value is required to be disclosed. The new rules were effective
for us beginning January 1, 2012. As of December 31, 2012, we had no fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 outside of our pension plans. The only impact for us is the
disclosure of the categorization in the fair value hierarchy for those items where fair value is only disclosed (primarily our debt



obligations).
Our disclosure related to the new standard is included in Note 6, "FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS," to the

Consolidated Financial
Statements

.

Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Effective

In December 2011, the FASB amended its standards related to offsetting assets and liabilities. This amendment requires entities to
disclose both gross and net information about certain instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and certain instruments and transactions subject to an
agreement similar to a master netting agreement. This information will enable users of the financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position. The new rules
will become effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. It is also required that the new disclosures are
applied for all comparative periods presented. In January 2013, the FASB further amended this standard to limit its scope to derivatives, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, securities
borrowings and lending transactions. We do not believe this amendment will have a significant effect on our

Consolidated Financial Statements

. While we
are still finalizing our analysis, due to the scope limitation we also do not expect any significant changes to our footnote disclosures.

In
February 2013, the FASB amended its standards on comprehensive income by requiring disclosure in the footnotes of information about amounts reclassified out of accumulated other
comprehensive income by component. Specifically, the amendment will require disclosure of the line items of net income in which the item was reclassified only if it is reclassified to net income in
its entirety in the same reporting period. It will also require cross reference to other disclosures for amounts that are not reclassified in their entirety in the same reporting period. The new
disclosures will be required for us prospectively only for annual periods beginning January 1, 2013 and interim periods within those annual periods.

ITEM 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. This risk is
closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swap contracts, commodity zero-cost collars and
interest rate swaps. As
stated in our policies and procedures, financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes, and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes. When material, we adjust the
value of our derivative contracts for counter-party or our credit risk.

Further
information regarding financial instruments and risk management is contained in Note 21, "DERIVATIVES," to our

Consolidated Financial
Statements

.

The
following describes our risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analysis performed as of December 31, 2012. The sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous, parallel
shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.

Foreign Exchange Rates

As a result of our international business presence, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks. We transact business in foreign
currencies and, as a result, our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. To help manage our exposure to exchange rate volatility, we use foreign
exchange forward contracts on a regular basis to hedge forecasted intercompany and third-party sales and purchases denominated in non-functional currencies. Our internal policy allows for
managing anticipated foreign currency cash flows for up to one year. These foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges under GAAP. The effective
portion of the unrealized gain or loss on the forward contract is deferred



and
reported as a component of "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" (AOCL). When the hedged forecasted transaction (sale or purchase) occurs, the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income
in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income. The ineffective portion of the hedge, unrealized gain or
loss, if any, is recognized in current income during the period of change. As of December 31, 2012, the amount we expect to reclassify from AOCL to income over the next year is an unrealized
net gain of $1 million. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, there were no circumstances that would have resulted in the discontinuance of a foreign currency cash flow hedge.

To
minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, we enter into foreign
currency forward contracts, which are considered economic hedges. The objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward
contract. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under GAAP.

As
of December 31, 2012, the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the
currencies of such contracts, would be approximately $45 million. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain
constant for the next 12 months. The analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels. It should be noted that any
change in the value of the contracts, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items (see Note 21, "DERIVATIVES," to our

Consolidated Financial
Statements

).

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. We manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use
of interest rate swaps. The objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk.

In
November 2005, we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert our $250 million debt issue, due in 2028, from a fixed rate of 7.125 percent to a floating
rate based on a LIBOR spread. The terms of the swap mirror those of the debt, with interest paid semi-annually. This swap qualifies as a fair value hedge under GAAP. The gain or loss on
this derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current income as "Interest expense." The following table
summarizes these gains and losses for the years presented below:

Commodity Price Risk

We are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers. In order to protect
ourselves against future price volatility and, consequently, fluctuations in gross margins, we periodically enter into commodity swap contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw
material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations. Certain commodity swap contracts are derivative contracts that are designated as cash
flow hedges under GAAP. We also have commodity swap contracts that represent an economic hedge but are not designated for hedge accounting and are marked to market through earnings. For those
contracts that qualify for hedge accounting, the effective



portion
of the unrealized gain or loss is deferred and reported as a component of AOCL. When the hedged forecasted transaction (purchase) occurs, the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into
income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income. The ineffective portion of the hedge, if any, is
recognized in current income in the period in which the ineffectiveness occurs. As of December 31, 2012, we expect to reclassify an unrealized net loss of less than $1 million from AOCL
to income over the next year. Our internal policy allows for managing these cash flow hedges for up to three years.

As
of December 31, 2012, the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity swap contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the price of such
commodities, was $11 million. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months. The analysis
ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels. It should be noted that any change in the value of the swap contracts, real or
hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items (see Note 21, "DERIVATIVES," to the

Consolidated Financial
Statements

).

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS

Management's Report on Financial Statements and Practices

The accompanying

Consolidated Financial Statements

of Cummins Inc. were prepared
by management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts that are based on
management's best judgments and estimates. The other financial information included in the annual report is consistent with that in the financial statements.

Management
also recognizes its responsibility for conducting our affairs according to the highest standards of personal and corporate conduct. This responsibility is characterized and
reflected in key policy statements issued from time to time regarding, among other things, conduct of its business activities within the laws of the host countries in which we operate, within The
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and potentially conflicting interests of its employees. We maintain a systematic program to assess compliance with these policies.

To
comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we designed and implemented a structured and comprehensive compliance process to evaluate our
internal control over financial reporting across the enterprise.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of Cummins Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of our

Consolidated Financial
Statements

for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Management
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and concluded it was effective as of December 31, 2012. In making its assessment, management
utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework.

The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Cummins Inc.:

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cummins Inc. and its
subsidiaries at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for
these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in
the accompanying "Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting." Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over
financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over
financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations

Cummins Inc. was founded in 1919 as a corporation in Columbus, Indiana, as one of the first diesel engine manufacturers. We are a
global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines and engine-related component products, including filtration, aftertreatment, turbochargers, fuel
systems, controls systems, air handling systems and electric power generation systems. We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and other customers worldwide. We
serve our customers through a network of approximately 600 company-owned and independent distributor locations and approximately 6,500 dealer locations in more than 190 countries and
territories.

Principles of Consolidation

Our

Consolidated Financial Statements

include the accounts of all wholly-owned and
majority-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries where our ownership is more than 50 percent of outstanding equity interests except for majority-owned subsidiaries that are considered variable
interest entities (VIEs) where we are not deemed to have a controlling financial interest. In addition, we also consolidate, regardless of our ownership percentage, VIEs for which we are deemed to
have a controlling financial interest. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Where our ownership interest is less than 100 percent, the noncontrolling
ownership interests are reported in our

Consolidated Balance Sheets

. The noncontrolling ownership interest in our income, net of tax, is classified as
"Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests" in our

Consolidated Statements of Income

.

Certain
amounts for 2011 and 2010 have been reclassified to conform to the current classifications.

We
have variable interests in several businesses accounted for under the equity method of accounting that are deemed to be VIEs and are subject to the provisions of accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) for variable interest entities. Most of these VIEs are unconsolidated and as such are included in the summary of disclosures in Note 3,
"INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INVESTEES." The VIEs, including the consolidated VIEs, are not material individually or in the aggregate to our

Consolidated Balance
Sheets

or

Consolidated Statements of Income

.

Investments in Equity Investees

We use the equity method to account for our investments in joint ventures, affiliated companies and alliances in which we have the
ability to exercise significant influence, generally represented by equity ownership or partnership equity of at least 20 percent but not more than 50 percent. Generally, under the
equity method, original investments in these entities are recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted by our share of equity in income or losses after the date of acquisition. Investment amounts in
excess of our share of an investee's net assets are amortized over the life of the related asset creating the excess. If the excess is goodwill, then it is not amortized. Equity in income or losses of
each investee is recorded according to our level of ownership; if losses accumulate, we record our share of losses until our investment has been fully depleted. If our investment has been fully
depleted, we recognize additional losses only when we are the primary funding source. We eliminate (to the extent of our ownership percentage) in our

Consolidated Financial
Statements

the profit in inventory held by our equity method investees that has not yet been sold to a third-party. Our investments are classified



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

as
"Investments and advances related to equity method investees" in our

Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Our share of the results from joint ventures,
affiliated companies and alliances is reported in our

Consolidated Statements of Income

as "Equity, royalty and interest income from investees," and is
reported net of all applicable income taxes.

Our
foreign equity investees are presented net of applicable foreign income taxes in our

Consolidated Statements of Income

. The vast
majority of our United States (U.S.) equity investees are partnerships (non-taxable), thus there is no difference between gross or net of tax presentation as the investees are not taxed.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of the Financial Statements

Preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported
amounts presented and disclosed in our

Consolidated Financial Statements

. Significant estimates and assumptions in these

Consolidated Financial Statements

require the exercise of judgment and are used for, but not limited to, allowance for doubtful accounts, estimates of
future cash flows and other assumptions associated with goodwill and long-lived asset impairment tests, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, warranty programs, determination of
discount and other rate assumptions for pension and other postretirement benefit expenses, restructuring costs, income taxes and deferred tax valuation allowances, lease classification and
contingencies. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be different from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue, net of estimated costs of returns, allowances and sales incentives, when it is realized or realizable, which
generally occurs when:

•

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,

•

The product has been shipped and legal title and all risks of ownership have been transferred,

•

The sales price is fixed and determinable and

•

Payment is reasonably assured.

Products
are generally sold on open account under credit terms customary to the geographic region of distribution. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do
not require collateral to secure our accounts receivable. For engines, service parts, service tools and other items sold to independent distributors and to partially-owned distributors accounted for
under the equity method, revenues are recorded when title and risk of ownership transfers. This transfer is based on the agreement in effect with the respective distributor, which in the U.S. and most
international locations, generally occurs when the products are shipped. To the extent of our ownership percentage, margins on sales to distributors accounted for under the equity method are deferred
until the distributor sells the product to unrelated parties.



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

We
provide various sales incentives to both our distribution network and our OEM customers. These programs are designed to promote the sale of our product in the channel or encourage the
usage of our products by OEM customers. Sales incentives primarily fall into three categories:

•

Volume rebates,

•

Market share rebates and

•

Aftermarket rebates.

For
volume rebates, we provide certain customers with rebate opportunities for attaining specified volumes during a particular quarter or year. We accrue for the expected amount of these
rebates at the time of the original sale and update our accruals quarterly based on our best estimate of the volume levels the customer will reach during the measurement period. For market share
rebates, we provide certain customers with rebate opportunities based on the percentage of their production that utilizes our product. These rebates are typically measured either quarterly or annually
and are accrued at the time of the original sale based on the current market shares, with adjustments made as the level changes. For aftermarket rebates we provide incentives to promote sales to
certain dealers and end-markets. These rebates are typically paid on a quarterly, or more frequent, basis and estimates are made at the end of each quarter as to the amount yet to be paid.
These estimates are based on historical experience with the particular program. The incentives are classified as a reduction in sales in our

Consolidated Statements of
Income

.

Rights
of return do not exist for the majority of our sales, other than for quality issues. We do offer certain return rights in our aftermarket business, where some aftermarket
customers are permitted to return small amounts of parts and filters each year and in our power generation business, which sells portable generators to retail customers. An estimate of future returns
is accrued at the time of sale based on historical return rates.

Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation

We translate assets and liabilities of foreign entities to U.S. dollars, where the local currency is the functional currency, at
year-end exchange rates. We translate income and expenses to U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates for the year. We record adjustments resulting from translation in a separate
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and include the adjustments in net income only upon sale or liquidation of the underlying foreign investment.

Foreign
currency transaction gains and losses are included in current net income. For foreign entities where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, including those operating in
highly inflationary economies when applicable, we remeasure non-monetary balances and the related
income statement using historical exchange rates. We include in income the resulting gains and losses, including the effect of derivatives in our

Consolidated Statements of
Income

, which combined with transaction gains and losses amounted to a net loss of $14 million in 2012, net loss of $14 million in 2011 and net loss of
$1 million in 2010.

Derivative Instruments

We make use of derivative instruments in foreign exchange, commodity price and interest rate hedging programs. Derivatives currently in
use are foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swap



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

contracts,
commodity zero-cost collars and an interest rate swap. These contracts are used strictly for hedging and not for speculative purposes.

Due
to our international business presence, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. We transact in foreign currencies and have significant assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies. Consequently, our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to benefit from global diversification and after considering
naturally offsetting currency positions, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize our existing exposures (recognized assets and liabilities) and hedge forecasted transactions.

We
are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers. In order to protect ourselves against future price volatility and,
consequently, fluctuations in gross margins, we periodically enter into commodity swap contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases with the objective of
minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations.

We
record all derivatives at fair value in our financial statements. Note 21, "DERIVATIVES," provides further information on our hedging strategy and accounting for derivative
financial instruments.

Income Tax Accounting

We determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future tax benefits
of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future
profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2012, we recorded net deferred tax assets of
$396 million. These assets included $165 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance of $95 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to
the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized. In the event our operating performance deteriorates, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will
be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex
issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax
positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available. A more complete description
of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in Note 4, "INCOME TAXES."

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents are defined as short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less
at the time of purchase. The carrying amounts reflected in our

Consolidated Balance Sheets

for cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to
the short-term maturity of these investments.

Marketable Securities

We account for marketable securities in accordance with GAAP for investments in debt and equity securities. We determine the
appropriate classification of all marketable securities as "held-to-maturity, "available-for-sale" or "trading" at the time of purchase, and
re-evaluate such classifications at each balance sheet date. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, all of our investments were classified as available-for-sale.

Available-for-sale
securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gain or loss, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income. Unrealized losses
considered to be "other-than-temporary" are recognized currently in income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. The fair value of most
investment securities is determined by currently available market prices. Where quoted market prices are not available, we use the market price of similar types of securities that are traded in the
market to estimate fair value. See Note 5, "MARKETABLE SECURITIES," for a detailed description of our investments in marketable securities.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, which approximates net realizable value, and generally do not bear
interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on our historical
collection experience and by performing an analysis of our accounts receivable in light of the current economic environment. We review our allowance for doubtful accounts on a regular basis. In
addition, when necessary, we provide an allowance for the full amount of specific accounts deemed to be uncollectible. Account balances are charged off against the allowance in the

Inventories

Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, approximately
14 percent and 17 percent, respectively, of our consolidated inventories (primarily heavy-duty and high-horsepower engines and parts) were valued using the
last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost method. The cost of other inventories is generally valued using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method. Our
inventories at interim and year-end reporting dates include estimates for adjustments related to annual physical inventory results and for inventory cost changes under the LIFO cost
method. Due to significant movements of partially-manufactured components and parts between manufacturing plants, we do not internally measure, nor do our accounting systems provide, a meaningful
segregation between raw materials and work-in-process.

Property, Plant and Equipment

We record property, plant and equipment, inclusive of assets under capital leases, at cost. We depreciate the cost of certain engine
production equipment using a modified units-of-production method, which is based upon units produced subject to a minimum level. We depreciate the cost of all other equipment
using the straight-line method with depreciable lives ranging from 20 to 40 years for buildings and three to 20 years for machinery, equipment and fixtures. Capital lease
amortization is recorded in depreciation expense. We expense normal maintenance and repair costs as incurred. Depreciation expense totaled $287 million, $264 million and
$248 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Long-Lived Assets

We review our long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value
of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of the long-lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are
largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. An impairment of a long-lived asset or asset group exists when the expected future pre-tax cash flows
(undiscounted and without interest charges) estimated to be generated by the asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset or
asset group, an impairment loss is measured based on the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the asset or asset group. Assumptions and estimates used to estimate cash
flows in the evaluation of impairment and the fair values used to determine the impairment are subject to a degree of judgment and complexity. Any



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

changes
to the assumptions and estimates resulting from changes in actual results or market conditions from those anticipated may affect the carrying value of long-lived assets and could
result in a future impairment charge.

Goodwill

Under GAAP for goodwill, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that
the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform an annual two-step goodwill impairment test. The
two-step impairment test is now only required if an entity determines through this qualitative analysis that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less
than its carrying value. In addition, carrying value of goodwill must be tested for impairment on an interim basis in certain circumstances where impairment may be indicated. When we are required or
opt to perform the two-step impairment test, the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated by discounting the after tax future cash flows less requirements for working capital and
fixed asset additions. Our reporting units are generally defined as one level below an operating segment. However, there were two situations where we have aggregated two or more components which share
similar economic characteristics and thus are aggregated into a single reporting unit for testing purposes. These two situations are described further below. This analysis has resulted in the
following reporting units for our goodwill testing:

•

Within our Components segment, emission solutions and filtration have been aggregated into a single reporting unit.

•

Also within our Components segment, our turbo technologies business is considered a separate reporting unit.

•

Within our Power Generation segment, our generator technologies business is considered a separate reporting unit.

•

Within our Engine segment, our new and recon parts business is considered a separate reporting unit. This reporting unit
is in the business of selling new parts and remanufacturing and reconditioning engines and certain engine components.

•

Our Distribution segment is considered a single reporting unit as it is managed geographically and all regions share
similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services.

No
other reporting units have goodwill. Our valuation method requires us to make projections of revenue, operating expenses, working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the
reporting units over a multi-year period. Additionally, management must estimate a weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects a market rate, for each reporting unit for use as a
discount rate. The discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and, if less than the carrying value, a separate valuation of the goodwill is required to determine if
an impairment loss has occurred. In addition, we also perform a sensitivity analysis to determine how much our forecasts can fluctuate before the fair value of a reporting unit would be lower than its
carrying amount. We performed the required procedures as of the end of our fiscal third quarter and determined that our goodwill was not impaired. At December 31, 2012, our recorded goodwill
was $445 million, approximately 90 percent of which resided in the emission solutions plus filtration reporting unit. For this reporting unit, the fair value of the reporting unit
exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin. Changes in our projections or estimates, a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect or a



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

significant
increase in the discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units and result in a future impairment of goodwill.

Software

We capitalize certain costs for software that are developed or obtained for internal use. Software costs are amortized on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives generally ranging from three to 12 years. Software assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate
that the carrying value may not be recoverable over the remaining lives of the assets. Upgrades and enhancements are capitalized if they result in significant modifications that enable the software to
perform tasks it was previously incapable of performing. Software maintenance, training, data conversion and business process reengineering costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.

Warranty

We charge the estimated costs of warranty programs, other than product recalls, to income at the time products are shipped to
customers. We use historical experience of warranty programs to develop the estimated liability for our various warranty programs. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency
of product recall programs, the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action or when a recall becomes probable and estimable, which generally occurs when it is announced.
The liability for these programs is reflected in the provision for warranties issued. We review and assess the liability for these programs on a quarterly basis. We also assess our ability to recover
certain costs from our suppliers and record a receivable from the supplier when we believe a recovery is probable. At December 31, 2012, we had $13 million of receivables related to
estimated supplier recoveries of which $7 million was included in "Trade and other receivables, net" and $6 million was included in "Other assets" on our

Consolidated Balance Sheets

. At
December 31, 2011, we had $14 million of receivables related to estimated supplier recoveries of which
$7 million was included in "Trade and other receivables, net" and $7 million was included in "Other assets" on our

Consolidated Balance
Sheets

.

In
addition, we sell extended warranty coverage on most of our engines. The revenue collected is initially deferred and is recognized as revenue in proportion to the costs expected to be
incurred in performing services over the contract period. We compare the remaining deferred revenue balance quarterly to the estimated amount of future claims under extended warranty programs and
provide an additional accrual when the deferred revenue balance is less than expected future costs.

Research and Development

Our research and development program is focused on product improvements, innovations and cost reductions for our customers. Research
and development expenditures include salaries, contractor fees, building costs, utilities, administrative expenses and allocation of corporate costs and are expensed, net of contract reimbursements,
when incurred. Research and development expenses, net of contract reimbursements, were $721 million in 2012, $621 million in 2011 and $402 million in 2010. Contract reimbursements
were $86 million in 2012, $75 million in 2011 and $68 million in 2010.

RECENTLY ADOPTED AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted

In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended its rules regarding the presentation of comprehensive income. The
objective of this amendment was to improve the comparability, consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income.
Specifically, this amendment requires that all non-owner changes in shareholders' equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but
consecutive statements. In addition, the standard also requires disclosure of the location of reclassification adjustments between other comprehensive income and net income on the face of the
financial statements. The new rules became effective for us beginning January 1, 2012. In December 2011, the FASB deferred certain aspects of this standard beyond the current effective date,
specifically the provisions dealing with
reclassification adjustments. Because the standard only impacts the display of comprehensive income and does not impact what is included in comprehensive income, the standard did not have a
significant impact on our

Consolidated Financial Statements

.

In
May 2011, the FASB amended its standards related to fair value measurements and disclosures. The objective of the amendment was to improve the comparability of fair value measurements
presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. Primarily this amendment changed the wording used to
describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in addition to clarifying the Board's intent about the
application of existing fair value measurement requirements. The new standard also requires additional disclosures related to fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair
value hierarchy and requires disclosure of the categorization in the hierarchy for items which are not recorded at fair value but fair value is required to be disclosed. The new rules were effective
for us beginning January 1, 2012. As of December 31, 2012, we had no fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 outside of our pension plans. The only impact for us is the
disclosure of the categorization in the fair value hierarchy for those items where fair value is only disclosed (primarily our debt obligations). Our disclosure related to the new standard is included
in Note 6, "FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS," to the

Consolidated Financial Statements

.

Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Effective

In December 2011, the FASB amended its standards related to offsetting assets and liabilities. This amendment requires entities to
disclose both gross and net information about certain instruments and



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

transactions
eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and certain instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting agreement. This information will
enable users of the financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position. The new rules will become effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or
after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. It is also required that the new disclosures are applied for all comparative periods presented. In January 2013, the FASB
further amended this standard to limit its scope to derivatives, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowings and lending transactions. We do not believe this amendment will
have a significant effect on our

Consolidated Financial Statements

. While we are still finalizing our analysis, due to the scope limitation we also do
not expect any significant changes to our footnote disclosures.

In
February 2013, the FASB amended its standards on comprehensive income by requiring disclosure in the footnotes of information about amounts reclassified out of accumulated other
comprehensive income by component. Specifically, the amendment will require disclosure of the line items of net income in which the item was reclassified only if it is reclassified to net income in
its entirety in the same reporting period. It will also require cross reference to other disclosures for amounts that are not reclassified in their entirety in the same reporting period. The new
disclosures will be required for us prospectively only for annual periods beginning January 1, 2013 and interim periods within those annual periods.

NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

Acquisitions

In April 2012, we reached an agreement to acquire the doser technology and business assets from Hilite Germany GmbH (Hilite) in
a cash transaction. Dosers are products that enable compliance with emission standards in certain aftertreatment systems and complement our current product offerings. The transaction was approved by
German regulators in June and closed on July 18, 2012. The purchase price was $176 million and is summarized below. There was no contingent consideration associated with this
transaction. During 2012, we expensed approximately $4 million of acquisition related costs.

The
acquisition of Hilite was accounted for as a business combination, with the results of the acquired entity and the goodwill included in the Components operating segment in the third
quarter of 2012. The majority of the purchase price was allocated to technology and customer related intangible assets and goodwill, most of which is expected to be fully deductible for tax purposes.
We expect the Hilite
acquisition to strengthen our aftertreatment product offerings. This acquisition enhances our technical capabilities and keeps us in a strong position to meet the needs of current customers and grow
into new markets, especially as an increasing number of regions around the world adopt tougher emission standards.

July 2012, we acquired an additional 45 percent interest in Cummins Central Power from the former principal for consideration of approximately $20 million. The
acquisition was accounted for as a business combination, with the results of the acquired entity included in the Distribution operating segment in the third quarter of 2012. Distribution segment
results also included a $7 million gain, as we were required to re-measure our pre-existing 35 percent ownership interest in Cummins Central Power to fair value
in accordance with GAAP. Net sales for Cummins Central Power were $242 million in 2012, of which $115 million was included in our

Consolidated Statements of
Income

and represented less than 1 percent of consolidated sales, and $209 million in 2011.

Divestitures

In the second quarter of 2011, we sold certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business which manufactures exhaust products and
select components for emission systems for
a variety of applications not core to our other product offerings. This business was historically included in our Components segment. The sales price was $123 million. We recognized a gain on
the sale of $68 million ($37 million after-tax), which included a goodwill allocation of $19 million. The gain was excluded from segment results as it was not
considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Sales
for this business were $62 million and $171 million in 2011 (through closing) and 2010, respectively. Income before income taxes for this business were approximately
$9 million and $22 million in 2011 (through closing) and 2010, respectively.

NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES (Continued)

During
the fourth quarter of 2011, we sold certain assets and liabilities of our light-duty filtration business which manufactures light-duty automotive and
industrial filtration solutions. The sales price was $90 million and included a note receivable from the buyer of approximately $1 million. There are no earnouts or other contingencies
associated with the sales price. We recognized a gain on the sale of $53 million ($33 million after-tax), which included a goodwill allocation of $6 million. The gain
was excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Sales
for this business were $64 million and $74 million in 2011 (through closing) and 2010, respectively. Income before income taxes for this business were approximately
$13 million and $9 million in 2011 (through closing) and 2010, respectively.

In
the second quarter of 2012, we recorded an additional $6 million gain ($4 million after-tax) related to final purchase price adjustments for our 2011
divestitures. The gain was excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2012.

On
January 1, 2010, with the adoption of the new FASB standard regarding consolidation of VIEs, we deconsolidated Cummins Komatsu Engine Corporation to account for it as an equity
investee. The impact of the deconsolidation on our

was minimal as all sales were eliminated in consolidation in the
past. The most significant impacts on our

Consolidated Balance Sheets

were to decrease current assets by $9 million, decrease
long-term assets by $10 million, increase investments and advances related to equity method investees by $11 million and decrease noncontrolling interest by
$11 million in 2010.

Distribution Entities

We have an extensive worldwide distributor and dealer network through which we sell and distribute our products and services.
Generally, our distributors are divided by geographic region with some of our distributors being wholly-owned by Cummins, some partially-owned and the majority independently owned. We consolidate all
wholly-owned distributors and partially-owned distributors where we are the primary beneficiary and account for other partially-owned distributors using the equity method of accounting.

•

North American Distributors

—Our distribution channel in North
America includes 11 unconsolidated partially-owned distributors. Our equity interests in these nonconsolidated entities range from 30 percent to 50 percent. We also have more than a
50 percent ownership interest in four partially owned distributors which we consolidate. While each distributor is a separate legal entity, the business of each is substantially the same as
that of our wholly-owned distributors based in other parts of the world. All of our distributors, irrespective of their legal structure or ownership, offer the full range of our products and services
to customers and end-users in their respective markets.

We
are contractually obligated to repurchase new engines, parts and components, special tools and signage from our North American distributors following an ownership transfer or
termination of the distributor. In addition, in certain cases where we own a partial interest in a distributor, we are obligated to purchase the other equity holders' interests if certain events occur
(such as the death of the distributor principal or a change in control of Cummins Inc.). The purchase price of the equity interests is determined based on the fair value of the distributor's
assets. Outside of North America, repurchase obligations and practices vary by region. All distributors that are partially-owned are considered to be related parties in our

Our
income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax
credits. Our 2012 income tax provision includes a one-time $134 million tax benefit resulting from transactions entered into and tax return elections made with respect to our
United Kingdom (U.K.) operations.

Retained
earnings of our U.K. domiciled subsidiaries and certain Singapore, German and Indian subsidiaries are considered to be permanently reinvested. In addition, earnings of our China
operations generated after December 31, 2011, are considered to be permanently reinvested and additional U.S. deferred tax is no longer being provided on these earnings generated after 2011.
China's permanently reinvested earnings are expected to be used for items such as capital expenditures and to fund joint ventures in China. The total permanently reinvested retained earnings and
related cumulative translation adjustment balances for these entities were $2.3 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively. These amounts were determined primarily based on book retained earnings balances for these subsidiaries translated at historical rates. The determination of the deferred tax liability
related to these retained earnings and cumulative translation adjustment balances which are considered to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. is not practicable. We may periodically repatriate
a portion of these earnings to the extent we can do so essentially tax-free or at minimal tax cost.

NOTE 4. INCOME TAXES (Continued)

For our remaining subsidiary companies and joint ventures outside the U.S., we provide for the additional taxes that would be due upon the dividend distribution of the income of those
foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures assuming the full utilization of foreign tax credits. Deferred taxes on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures, including those in China
generated in years prior to 2012, were $213 million and $222 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We have $702 million of retained earnings and related
cumulative translation adjustments in our China operations generated prior to December 31, 2011, and have provided a U.S. deferred tax liability of
$158 million relating to these earnings and related translation adjustments. We anticipate that these earnings will be distributed to the U.S. within the next five years.

Income
before income taxes includes equity income of foreign joint ventures of $192 million, $234 million and $218 million for the years ended December 31,
2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. This equity income is recorded net of foreign taxes. Additional U.S. income taxes of $9 million, $49 million and $50 million for the years ended
December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, were provided for the additional U.S. taxes that will ultimately be due upon the distribution of the foreign joint venture equity income.

the uncertainty regarding the realization of a portion of the U.S. state and foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits. Prepaid and other current assets includes deferred tax
assets of $232 million and $268 million
for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In addition, prepaid and other current assets includes refundable income taxes of $240 million and $45 million for

Included
in the December 31, 2012 and 2011, balances are $87 million and $75 million related to tax positions that, if recognized, would favorably impact the
effective tax rate in future periods. Also, we had accrued interest expense related to the unrecognized tax benefits of $2 million, $7 million and $30 million as of
December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. During the years ending
December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, we recognized $(3) million, $(15) million and $5 million in net interest expense, respectively. In 2011, as a result of the settlement of
certain tax positions with tax authorities in China, we reduced our liability for unrecognized tax benefits by $39 million and the related net accrued interest of $16 million. The
$39 million reduction was fully offset by adjustments to other income tax balance sheet accounts resulting in zero net income statement impact. As the
settlement with the tax authorities included no interest or penalties being incurred, we recognized a $16 million income tax benefit in 2011 from the release of the accrued interest previously
recorded related to the unrecognized tax benefits that were settled.

NOTE 4. INCOME TAXES (Continued)

Audit
outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. Although we believe that adequate provision has been made for such issues, there is the
possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on our earnings. Conversely, if these issues are resolved favorably in the future, the related provision would be
reduced, thus having a positive impact on earnings. We do not expect any significant change to our unrecognized tax benefits within the next year.

As
a result of our global operations, we file income tax returns in various jurisdictions including U.S. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. We are routinely subject to examination
by taxing authorities throughout the world, including Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, India, Mexico, the U.K. and the U.S. With few exceptions, our U.S. federal, major state and
foreign jurisdictions are no longer subject to income tax assessments for years before 2009.

NOTE 6. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit
price). We utilize market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions
about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable. We primarily apply the market
approach for recurring fair value measurements and utilize the best available information. Accordingly, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use
of unobservable inputs. We are able to classify fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value giving the
highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3
measurement). At December 31, 2012, we did not have any Level 3 financial assets or liabilities, other than those in our pension plan (see Note 12, "PENSION BENEFITS AND OTHER
POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS").

The
majority of the assets and liabilities we carry at fair value are AFS securities and derivatives. AFS securities are derived from Level 1 or Level 2 inputs. The
predominance of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. The fair value measurement of
derivatives are valued primarily using Level 2 inputs. Many of our derivative contracts are valued utilizing publicly available pricing data of contracts with similar terms. In other cases, the
contracts are valued using current spot market data adjusted for the appropriate current forward curves provided by external financial institutions. We participate in commodity swap contracts,
commodity zero-cost collar contracts, currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps. When material, we adjust the values of our derivative contracts for counter-party or our credit
risk. There were no transfers into or out of Levels 2 or 3 during 2012.

The
substantial majority of our assets were valued utilizing a market approach. A description of the valuation techniques and inputs used for our Level 2 fair value measures are
as follows:

Debt mutual funds

—Assets in Level 2 consist of exchange traded mutual funds that lack sufficient trading volume to be classified at
Level 1. The fair value measure for these investments is the daily net asset value published on a regulated governmental website. Daily quoted prices are available from the issuing brokerage
and are used on a test basis to corroborate this Level 2 input.

Bank debentures and Certificates of deposit

—These investments provide us with a fixed rate of return and generally range in maturity from six months
to three years. The counter-parties to these investments are reputable financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. Since these instruments are not tradable and must be settled
directly by us with the respective financial institution, our fair value measure is the financial institutions' month-end statement.

Government debt securities-non-U.S. and Corporate debt securities

—The fair value measure for these securities are broker
quotes received from reputable
firms. These securities are infrequently traded on a national stock exchange and these values are used on a test basis to corroborate our Level 2 input measure.



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 6. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued)

Foreign currency forward contracts

—The fair value measure for these contracts are determined based on forward foreign exchange rates received from
third-party pricing services. These rates are based upon market transactions and are periodically corroborated by comparing to third-party broker quotes.

Commodity swap contracts

—The fair value measure for these contracts are current spot market data adjusted for the appropriate current forward curves
provided by external financial institutions. The current spot price is the most significant component of this valuation and is based upon market transactions. We use third-party pricing services for
the spot price component of this valuation which is periodically corroborated by market data from broker quotes.

Commodity call and put option contracts

—We utilize the month-end statement from the issuing financial institution as our fair value
measure for this investment. We corroborate this valuation through the use of a third-party pricing service for similar assets and liabilities.

Interest rate contracts

—We currently have only one interest rate contract. We utilize the month-end statement from the issuing financial
institution as our fair value measure for this investment. We corroborate this valuation through the use of a third-party pricing service for similar assets and liabilities.

Revolving Credit Facility

On November 9, 2012, we entered into a five-year revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders. The credit
agreement provides us with a $1.75 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, the proceeds of which are to be used by us for working capital or other general corporate purposes.

The
credit facility matures on November 9, 2017. Amounts payable under our revolving credit facility will rank pro rata with all of our unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness. Up
to $200 million under our credit facility is available for swingline loans denominated in U.S. dollars. Advances under the facility bear interest at (i) a base rate or (ii) a rate
equal to the LIBOR Rate plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of our outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt. Based on our
current long-term debt ratings, the applicable margin on LIBOR Rate loans was 0.875 percent per annum as of December 31, 2012. Advances under the facility may be prepaid
without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs.

The
credit agreement includes various covenants, including, among others, maintaining a leverage ratio of no more than 3.25 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2012, we were in compliance
with the covenants.

The
table below is a reconciliation of the maximum capacity of our revolver to the amount available under the facility as of December 31, 2012. There were no outstanding

During
2010, two of our wholly-owned Brazilian subsidiaries entered into a loan agreement for a loan in local currency in an amount equivalent to US $50 million, at drawdown, at a
fixed rate of 4.5 percent to finance its exports over the next three years. The principal of the loan had a two-year grace period and began amortizing in 2012.

During
2009, one wholly-owned subsidiary, Cummins Brasil Ltda, entered into a loan agreement with the Brazil development bank, BNDES, for a loan in local currency in an amount
equivalent to US
$45 million, at drawdown, at a fixed rate of 4.5 percent to finance its exports over the next three years. The principal of the loan had a two-year grace period which began
amortizing in 2011 and was completed in August of 2012.

Our
debt agreements contain several restrictive covenants. The most restrictive of these covenants applies to our revolving credit facility which will upon default, among other things,
limit our ability to

borrowing agreements.

NOTE 11. PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY

We charge the estimated costs of warranty programs, other than product recalls, to income at the time products are shipped to customers. We use historical claims experience to develop
the estimated liability. We review product recall programs on a quarterly basis and, if necessary, record a liability when we commit to an action or when they become probable and estimable, which is
reflected in the provision for warranties issued line. We also sell extended warranty coverage on several engines. The following is a tabular reconciliation of the product warranty liability,

NOTE 12. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

Pension Plans

We sponsor several contributory and noncontributory pension plans covering substantially all employees. Generally, hourly employee
pension benefits are earned based on years of service and compensation during active employment while future benefits for salaried employees are determined using a cash balance formula. However, the
level of benefits and terms of
vesting may vary among plans. Pension plan assets are administered by trustees and are principally invested in equity securities and fixed income securities. It is our policy to make contributions to
our various qualified plans in accordance with statutory and contractual funding requirements and any additional contributions we determine are appropriate.

Plan Assets

Our investment policies in the U.S. and U.K. provide for the rebalancing of assets to maintain our long-term strategic
asset allocation. We are committed to its long-term strategy and do not attempt to time the market given empirical evidence that asset allocation is more critical than individual asset or
investment manager selection. Rebalancing of the assets has and continues to occur. The rebalancing is critical to having the proper weighting of assets to achieve the expected total portfolio
returns. We believe that our portfolio is highly diversified and does not have any significant exposure to concentration risk. The plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans do not include any
of our common stock.

U.S.
Plan Assets

For
the U.S. qualified pension plans, our assumption for the expected return on assets was 8.0 percent in 2012. Projected returns are based primarily on
broad, publicly traded equity and fixed income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management. We expect additional positive returns from this active investment
management. Based on the historical



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 12. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (Continued)

returns
and forward-looking return expectations, we have elected to use an assumption of 8.0 percent per year beginning in 2013.

The
primary investment objective is to exceed, on a net-of-fee basis, the rate of return of a policy portfolio comprised of the following:

Asset Class

The
fixed income component is structured to represent a custom bond benchmark that will closely hedge the change in the value of our liabilities. This component is structured in such a
way that its benchmark covers approximately 90 percent of the plan's exposure to changes in its discount rate
(AA corporate bond yields). In order to achieve a hedge on more than the targeted 46 percent of plan assets invested in fixed income securities, the Benefits Policy Committee does permit
the fixed income managers, other managers or the custodian/trustee to utilize derivative securities, as part of a liability driven investment strategy to further reduce the plan's risk of declining
interest rates. However, all managers hired to manage assets for the trust are prohibited from using leverage unless specifically discussed with the committee and allowed for in their guidelines.

U.K.
Plan Assets

For
the U.K. qualified pension plans, our assumption for the expected return on assets was 6.5 percent in 2012. The methodology used to determine the
rate of return on pension plan assets in the U.K. was based on establishing an equity-risk premium over current long-term bond yields adjusted based on target asset
allocations. Our strategy with respect to our investments in these assets is to be invested in a suitable mixture of return-seeking assets (equities and real estate) and liability matching assets
(bonds) with a long-term outlook. Therefore, the risk and return balance of our U.K. asset portfolio should reflect a long-term horizon. To achieve these objectives we have
established the following targets:

Level 3
Assets

The
investments in an insurance contract, private equity and real estate funds, for which quoted market prices are not available, are valued at their estimated
fair value as determined by applicable investment managers or by quarterly financial statements of the funds. These financial statements are audited at least annually. In conjunction with our
investment consultant, we monitor the fair value of the insurance contract as periodically reported by our insurer and their counterparty risk. The fair value of all real estate properties, held in
the partnerships, are valued at least once per year by an independent professional real estate valuation firm. Fair value generally represents the fund's proportionate share of the net assets of the
investment partnerships as reported by the general partners of the underlying partnerships. Some securities with no readily available market are initially valued at cost, utilizing independent
professional valuation firms as well as market comparisons with subsequent adjustments to values which reflect either the basis of meaningful third-party transactions in the private market or the fair
value deemed appropriate by the general partners of the underlying investment partnerships. In such instances, consideration is also given to the financial condition and operating results of the
issuer, the amount that the investment partnerships can reasonably expect to realize upon the sale of the securities and any other factors deemed relevant. The estimated fair values are subject to
uncertainty and therefore may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market for such investments existed and such differences could be material.

Estimated Future Contributions and Benefit Payments

We plan to contribute approximately $170 million to our defined benefit pension plans in 2013. The table below presents expected

We also sponsor defined contribution plans for certain hourly and salaried employees. Our contributions to these plans were
$74 million, $72 million and $44 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

Other Postretirement Benefits

Our other postretirement benefit plans provide various health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees, who retire and
satisfy certain age and service requirements, and their dependents. The plans are contributory and contain cost-sharing features such as caps, deductibles, coinsurance and spousal
contributions. Employer contributions are limited by formulas in each plan. Retiree contributions for health care benefits are adjusted annually and we reserve the right to change benefits covered
under these plans. There were no plan assets for the postretirement benefit plans as our policy is to fund benefits and expenses for these plans as claims and premiums are incurred.

NOTE 12. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (Continued)

Our consolidated other postretirement benefit obligation is determined by application of the terms of health care and life insurance plans, together with relevant actuarial assumptions
and health care cost trend rates. For measurement purposes, an 8.00 percent annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed in 2012. The rate was
assumed to remain at 8.00 percent in 2013 and then decrease on a linear basis to 5.00 percent through 2019 and remain at that level thereafter. An increase in the health care cost trends
of 1 percent would increase our APBO by $27 million as of December 31, 2012 and the net periodic other postretirement benefit expense for 2013
by $1 million. A decrease in the health care cost trends of 1 percent would decrease our APBO by $23 million as of December 31, 2012 and the net periodic other
postretirement benefit expense for 2013 by $1 million.

NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

We are subject to numerous lawsuits and claims arising out of the ordinary course of our business, including actions related to product liability; personal injury; the use and
performance of our products; warranty matters; patent, trademark or other intellectual property infringement; contractual liability; the conduct of our business; tax reporting in foreign
jurisdictions; distributor termination; workplace safety; and environmental matters. We also have been identified as a potentially responsible party at multiple waste disposal sites under U.S. federal
and related state environmental statutes and regulations and may have joint and several liability for any investigation and remediation costs incurred with respect to such sites. We have denied
liability with respect to many of these lawsuits, claims and proceedings and are vigorously defending such lawsuits, claims and proceedings. We carry various forms of commercial, property and
casualty, product liability and other forms of insurance; however, such insurance may not be applicable or adequate to cover the costs associated with a judgment against us with respect to these
lawsuits, claims and proceedings. We do not believe that these lawsuits are



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)

material
individually or in the aggregate. While we believe we have also established adequate accruals for our expected future liability with respect to pending lawsuits, claims and proceedings, where
the nature and extent of any such liability can be reasonably estimated based upon then presently available information, there can be no assurance that the final resolution of any existing or future
lawsuits, claims or proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

We
conduct significant business operations in Brazil that are subject to the Brazilian federal, state and local labor, social security, tax and customs laws. While we believe we comply
with such laws, they are complex, subject to varying interpretations and we are often engaged in litigation regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances. In 2010, it was
determined that we overpaid a Brazilian revenue based tax during the period 2004-2008. Our results include a recovery of $32 million recorded in cost of sales ($21 million
after-tax) related to tax credits on imported products arising from an overpayment. This recovery has been excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of
operating results for the year.

In
June 2008, four of our sites in Southern Indiana, including our Technical Center, experienced extensive flood damage. In October 2011, we received $40 million from our
insurance carriers to settle all outstanding 2008 flood claims. As a result, we recognized a gain of approximately $38 million ($24 million after-tax), net of any remaining
flood related expenses, in "Other operating income (expense), net" in our

Consolidated Statements of Income

U.S. Distributor Commitments

Our distribution agreements with independent and partially-owned distributors generally have a renewable three-year term
and are restricted to specified territories. Our distributors develop and maintain a network of dealers with which we have no direct relationship. Our distributors are permitted to sell other,
noncompetitive products only with our consent. We license all of our distributors to use our name and logo in connection with the sale and service of our products, with no right to assign or
sublicense the trademarks, except to authorized dealers, without our consent. Products are sold to the distributors at standard domestic or international distributor net prices, as applicable. Net
prices are wholesale prices we establish to permit our distributors an adequate margin on their sales. Subject to local laws, we can generally refuse to renew these agreements upon expiration or
terminate them upon written notice for inadequate sales, change in principal ownership and certain other reasons. Distributors also have the right to terminate the agreements upon 60-day
notice without cause, or 30-day notice for cause.
Upon termination or failure to renew, we are required to purchase the distributor's current inventory, signage and special tools, and may, at our option purchase other assets of the distributor, but
are under no obligation to do so.

Other Guarantees and Commitments

In addition to the matters discussed above, from time to time we enter into other guarantee arrangements, including guarantees of
non-U.S. distributor financing, residual value guarantees on equipment under operating leases and other miscellaneous guarantees of third-party obligations. As of December 31, 2012,
the maximum potential loss related to these other guarantees is summarized as

The
amount of liabilities related to the above guarantees was $2 million.

We
have arrangements with certain suppliers that require us to purchase minimum volumes or be subject to monetary penalties. The penalty amounts are less than our purchase commitments
and essentially allow the supplier to recover their tooling costs in most instances. As of December 31, 2012, if we were to stop purchasing from each of these suppliers, the aggregate amount of
the penalty would be approximately $94 million, of which $90 million relates to a contract with an engine parts supplier that extends to 2016. In addition, we also have a "take or pay"
contract with an emission solutions business supplier requiring us to purchase approximately $73 million annually through 2018. These arrangements enable us to secure critical components. We do
not currently anticipate paying any penalties under these contracts.

We
have guarantees with certain customers that require us to satisfactorily honor contractual or regulatory obligations, or compensate for monetary losses related to nonperformance.
These performance bonds and other performance-related guarantees were $70 million and $81 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Indemnifications

Periodically, we enter into various contractual arrangements where we agree to indemnify a third-party against certain types of losses.
Common types of indemnities include:

•

product liability and license, patent or trademark indemnifications,

•

asset sale agreements where we agree to indemnify the purchaser against future environmental exposures related to the
asset sold and

•

any contractual agreement where we agree to indemnify the counter-party for losses suffered as a result of a
misrepresentation in the contract.

We
regularly evaluate the probability of having to incur costs associated with these indemnities and accrue for expected losses that are probable. Because the indemnities are not related
to specified known liabilities and due to their uncertain nature, we are unable to estimate the maximum amount of the potential loss associated with these indemnifications.

Joint Venture Commitments

As of December 31, 2012, we have committed to invest an additional $86 million into existing joint ventures with
$75 million to be funded in 2013.

Employee Benefits Trust

In 1997, we established the Employee Benefits Trust (EBT) funded with common stock for use in meeting our future obligations under
employee benefit and compensation plans. The primary sources of cash for the EBT are dividends received on unallocated shares of our common stock held by the EBT. The EBT may be used to fund matching
contributions to employee accounts in the 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) made in proportion to employee contributions under the terms of the RSP. In

NOTE 17. STOCK INCENTIVE AND STOCK OPTION PLANS

In May 2012, our shareholders approved the 2012 Omnibus Plan (the Plan), which replaced and succeeded the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan. The Plan allows for the granting of up to
13.5 million stock-based awards to executives and employees, of which one-half must be in the form of stock options or stock appreciation rights. Awards available for grant under
the Plan include, but are not limited to, stock options, stock appreciation rights and stock awards. Shares issued under the Plan may be newly issued shares or reissued treasury shares.

Stock
options are generally granted with a strike price equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant, a life of 10 years and a two-year vesting
period. The strike price may be higher than the fair value of the stock on the date of the grant, but cannot be lower. Compensation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period beginning on the grant date. The compensation expense is based on the fair value of each option grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Options granted to employees eligible
for retirement under our retirement plan are fully expensed as of the grant date.

Stock
options are also awarded through the Key Employee Stock Investment Plan (KESIP) which allows certain employees, other than officers, to purchase shares of common stock on an
installment basis up to an established credit limit. Fifty stock options are granted for every even block of 100 KESIP shares purchased by the employee. The options granted through the KESIP program
are considered awards under the Plan and are vested immediately. Compensation expense for stock options granted through the KESIP program is recorded based on the fair value of each option grant using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

Performance
shares are granted as target awards and are earned based on our return on equity (ROE) performance. A payout factor has been established ranging from 0 to 200 percent
of the target award based on our actual ROE performance. Shares granted during or prior to 2010, have a two-year performance period and a one year restriction period. Employees leaving the
company prior to the end of the restriction period forfeit any shares subject to the restriction period. Shares granted during 2011 or after, have a three-year performance period and no
restriction period. The fair value of the award is equal to the average market price, adjusted for the present value of dividends over the vesting period, of our stock on the grant date. Compensation
expense is recorded ratably over the period beginning on the grant date until the shares become unrestricted and is based on the amount of the award that is expected to be earned under the plan
formula, adjusted each reporting period based on current information.

Restricted
common stock is awarded from time to time at no cost to certain employees. Participants are entitled to cash dividends and voting rights. Restrictions limit the sale or
transfer of the shares during a defined period. Generally, one-third of the shares become vested and free from restrictions after two years and one-third of the shares issued
become vested and free from restrictions each year thereafter on the anniversary of the grant date, provided the participant remains an employee. The fair value of the award is equal to the average
market price of our stock on the grant date. Compensation expense is determined at the grant date and is recognized over the four-year restriction period on a straight-line
basis.

Compensation
expense (net of estimated forfeitures) related to our share-based plans for the year ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was approximately $35 million,
$40 million and $20 million, respectively. The excess tax benefit/(deficiency) associated with our share-based plans for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, was
$14 million, $5 million and $10 million, respectively.

NOTE 19. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES

We have executed restructuring actions primarily in the form of involuntary separation programs in the fourth quarter of 2012. These actions were in response to deterioration in our U.S.
businesses and most key markets around the world in the second half of 2012, as well as a reduction in orders in most U.S. and global markets for 2013. We reduced our worldwide professional workforce
by approximately 650
employees, or 3 percent. We also reduced our hourly workforce by approximately 650 employees. During 2012, we incurred a pre-tax charge related to the professional and hourly
workforce reductions of approximately $49 million.

Employee
termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated, benefits
to be paid under existing severance plans or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan. Estimates of restructuring were made based on information available at the
time charges were recorded. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved, actual amounts paid for such activities may differ from amounts initially recorded and we may need to revise previous estimates.

We
incurred a $1 million charge for lease terminations and a $2 million charge for asset impairments and other non-cash charges. During 2012, we recorded
restructuring and other charges of $52 million ($35 million after-tax). These restructuring actions included:

NOTE 20. EARNINGS PER SHARE

period. The calculation of diluted EPS assumes the issuance of common stock for all potentially dilutive share equivalents outstanding. We exclude shares of common stock held in the EBT (see
Note 15, "SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY") from the calculation of the weighted-average common shares

such options had an exercise price in excess of the monthly average market value of our common stock during that year.

NOTE 21. DERIVATIVES

We are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. This risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of
financial derivative instruments including foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swap contracts, commodity zero-cost collars and interest rate swaps. As stated in our policies and
procedures, financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes, and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes. When material, we adjust the value of our derivative
contracts for counter-party or our credit risk.

Foreign Exchange Rates

As a result of our international business presence, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks. We transact business in foreign
currencies and, as a result, our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. To help manage our exposure to exchange rate volatility, we use foreign
exchange forward contracts on a regular basis to hedge forecasted intercompany and third-party sales and purchases denominated in non-functional currencies. Our internal policy allows for
managing anticipated foreign currency cash flows for up to one year. These foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges under GAAP. The effective
portion of the unrealized gain or loss on the forward contract is deferred and reported as a component of "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" (AOCL). When the hedged forecasted transaction (sale or
purchase) occurs, the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction
affects income. The ineffective portion of the hedge, unrealized gain or loss, if any, is recognized in current income during
the period of change. As of December 31, 2012, the amount we expect to reclassify from AOCL to income over the next year is an unrealized net gain of $1 million. For the years ended
December 31, 2012 and 2011, there were no circumstances that would have resulted in the discontinuance of a foreign currency cash flow hedge.



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 21. DERIVATIVES (Continued)

To minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, we enter into foreign
currency forward contracts, which are considered economic hedges. The objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward
contract. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under GAAP.

The
table below summarizes our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts. Only the U.S. dollar forward contracts are designated and qualify for hedge accounting as of each period
presented below. The currencies in this table represent 95 percent and 98 percent of the notional amounts of contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2012 and 2011.

Commodity Price Risk

We are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers. In order to protect
ourselves against future price volatility and, consequently, fluctuations in gross margins, we periodically enter into commodity swap contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw
material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations. Certain commodity swap contracts are derivative contracts that are designated as cash
flow hedges under GAAP. We also have commodity swap contracts that represent an economic hedge but are not designated for hedge accounting and are marked to market through earnings. For those
contracts that qualify for hedge accounting, the effective
portion of the unrealized gain or loss is deferred and reported as a component of AOCL. When the hedged forecasted transaction (purchase) occurs, the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into
income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income. The ineffective portion of the hedge, if any, is
recognized in current income in the period in which the ineffectiveness occurs. As of December 31, 2012, we expect to reclassify an unrealized net loss of less than $1 million from AOCL
to income over the next year. Our internal policy allows for managing these cash flow hedges for up to three years.

A

In
the third quarter of 2012 we began to use a combination of call and put option contracts for copper in net-zero-cost collar arrangements (zero-cost
collars) that establish ceiling and floor prices for copper. These contracts are used strictly for hedging and not for speculative purposes. For these zero-cost collars, if the average
price of the copper during the calculation period is within the call and put price, the call and put contracts expire at no
cost to us. If the price falls below the floor, the counter-party to the collar receives the difference from us, and if the price rises above the ceiling, the counter-party pays the difference to us.
We believe that these zero-cost collars will act as economic hedges; however we have chosen not to designate them as hedges for accounting purposes, therefore we present the calls and puts
on a gross basis on our

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. We manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use
of interest rate swaps. The objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk.

In
November 2005, we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert our $250 million debt issue, due in 2028, from a fixed rate of 7.125 percent to a floating
rate based on a LIBOR spread. The terms of the swap mirror those of the debt, with interest paid semi-annually. This swap qualifies as a fair value hedge under GAAP. The gain or loss on
this derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current income as

NOTE 22. OPERATING SEGMENTS

Operating segments under GAAP are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating
decision-maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Cummins chief operating decision-maker (CODM) is the Chief Executive Officer.

Our
reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Components, Power Generation and Distribution. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and
markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers
in on-highway and various industrial markets. Our engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well as in various industrial applications, including
construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military equipment. The Components segment sells filtration products, aftertreatment, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Power
Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines, generator sets and alternators. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships
engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMs throughout
the world.

We
use segment EBIT (defined as earnings before interest expense, taxes and noncontrolling interests) as a primary basis for the CODM to evaluate the performance of each of our operating
segments. Segment amounts exclude certain expenses not specifically identifiable to segments.

The
accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those applied in our

Consolidated Financial Statements

. We prepared the
financial results of our operating segments on a basis that is
consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We have allocated certain common costs and expenses,



CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 22. OPERATING SEGMENTS (Continued)

primarily
corporate functions, among segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (GAAP). These include certain costs and expenses of shared services, such as information technology, human resources, legal and finance. We also do not allocate debt-related
items, actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, changes in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance, flood damage gains or losses, divestiture gains or losses or income
taxes to individual segments. In 2012, non-segment items included a $20 million reserve ($12 million after-tax) related to legal matters and a $6 million gain related
to adjustments from our 2011 divestitures, while 2011 included the gain on disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and our light-duty filtration business and
2010 included a Brazil revenue tax recovery. These gains were not allocated to the businesses as they were not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year. Segment EBIT may not be
consistent with measures used by other companies.

after-tax), a $6 million gain ($4 million after-tax) related to adjustments to our 2011 divestitures and a $20 million reserve ($12 million

Earnings
per share in each quarter is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during that quarter while earnings per share for the
full year is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the year. Thus, the sum of the four quarters earnings per share may not equal the full year earnings per share.

At
December 31, 2012, there were approximately 3,977 holders of record of Cummins Inc.'s $2.50 par value common stock.
